      " This text appears to be a scientific research paper on the topic of nuclear physics, specifically focusing on the calculation of decay half-lives for alpha decays in atomic nuclei and the penetration of potential barriers. The authors have developed a new analytical formula based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to calculate the barrier penetrability, taking into account the influence of the long-range Coulomb tail in the barrier potential.  The text includes a comparison of the results obtained using different approaches, including the parabolic approximation and the WKB approach, for various isotopes of Po (polonium). The authors have assumed the barrier potential to be spherical for most cases, and they have shown that their new formula gives very good results for these spherical nuclei.  The text also discusses the importance of evaluating the integral in the equation for the penetrability and provides an analytical expression for it. The computation was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation, the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China, the Knowledge Innovation Project of CAS, and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Overall, the text presents a new analytical formula for calculating barrier penetrability in nuclear physics, which could be useful for studying barrier penetrability where one has to introduce an energy-dependent one-dimensional potential barrier or a barrier distribution function.\n"
