 The text appears to be discussing the results of an analysis of sunspot data, specifically looking for periodicities in sunspot area fluctuations during the maximum activity period of solar cycle 16. The authors found that the existence of a periodicity around 0 days (approximately 6 solar rotations) is questionable based on their analysis of the time series and comparison with autocorrelation functions. They also noted that power spectrum analysis alone may not be sufficient to identify true periodicities, as it can be affected by aliases and subharmonics. The authors suggest that a combination of correlative and power spectrum analyses may be more effective in detecting statistically significant peaks in the periodograms.  The text also mentions that there are differences between the northern and southern hemispheres in terms of sunspot activity and periodicities, which is why separate analyses were conducted for each hemisphere. The authors found that while there was a statistically significant positive peak in the autocorrelation function and periodogram for daily sunspot area fluctuations from the southern hemisphere during the maximum activity period, it was not clear whether this represented a real periodicity or an alias.  Overall, the text suggests that further research is needed to confirm the existence of any specific periodicities in sunspot data, and that a combination of different analysis methods may be more effective than relying on any one method alone. The authors also emphasize the importance of considering the context and specific characteristics of the data being analyzed.

 This text appears to be discussing the calculation of decay half-lives for nuclear reactions, specifically for alpha decays in various isotopes. The authors compare the results obtained using different approaches: the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approach, the parabolic approximation, and a new formula derived in this work.  The text also mentions that the barrier potential is assumed to be spherical for most of the calculations, but this assumption may not hold for all nuclei. The authors find good agreement between their calculated results and experimental data for spherical nuclei, with small deviations. They attribute the success of the new formula to its proper treatment of the long-range Coulomb tail in the barrier potential.  The text also mentions that the calculation was supported by various grants and computational resources. The derivation of the analytical expression for the integral in eq. (ef{x1x2}) is provided, with some approximations made to simplify the evaluation.

 This text discusses the comparison of numerical integrators for computing molecular dynamics steps in the Schwinger model using the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. The authors consider a 2D lattice with specific parameters taken from a reference, aiming to simulate near the scaling limit with light fermions and increase the impact of the fermion part of the action. They use one thermalized gauge configuration and generate independent sets of momenta for each integrator and step size. The absolute error and statistical error are computed for each case.  The text compares the performance of several numerical integrators, including multi-rate schemes (Stochastic Heun, Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg, and Dormand-Prince), and their standard versions. Figure 1 shows the absolute error versus the step size, demonstrating that the multi-rate schemes outperform their standard counterparts as expected. The scheme with the best accuracy is the nested force-gradient method, which just slightly edges the adapted nested force-gradient scheme.  Figure 2 presents the CPU time required for each integrator versus the achieved accuracy. The results show that the nested force-gradient method and adapted nested force-gradient method are more computationally efficient than the other integrators, even compared to the 11-stage scheme. The modification proposed in a reference also performs better than its original version with almost similar computational costs.  The text also discusses the number of inversions of the Dirac operator needed to reach a 90% acceptance rate of the HMC algorithm and shows that the adapted nested force-gradient method and nested force-gradient method require the least number of inversions per trajectory. The authors suggest that these methods have the potential to perform even better in lattice QCD problems due to the significant impact of the fermion action and the computational time required to obtain the inversion of the Dirac operator.  In future work, the authors plan to apply this approach to the HMC algorithm for numerical integration in lattice QCD and expect the adapted nested-force gradient scheme to outperform the original one if they further partition the action into more parts using techniques to factorize the fermion determinant.

 This text describes a paper that derives new functional equations for Feynman integrals using simple methods without integration by parts techniques. The paper also shows how integrals with many kinematic arguments can be reduced to combinations of simpler integrals with fewer arguments. The authors plan to demonstrate in future publications that applying functional equations can reduce "master integrals" to a combination of simpler integrals from a "universal" basis.  The method used in this paper is based on algebraic relations for "deformed propagators." This method can be applied not only to vacuum-type integrals but also to integrals that depend on external momenta. The text discusses particular cases of functional equations and mentions the need for a systematic investigation using methods from algebraic geometry and group theory.  The paper also presents new hypergeometric representations for one-loop massless vertex type integrals, which were discovered by relating dimensionally regularized one-loop vertex type integrals to two-dimensional integrals through a functional equation. The authors summarize their accomplishments in the paper and express gratitude for support from the German Science Foundation (DFG).

 This text discusses the comparison between two methods, frequency Hough and sky Hough, used in the analysis of gravitational waves. The authors find that the use of an over-resolution for the sky map increases the amplitude loss for both methods but has a greater impact on the computing cost for the sky Hough method. They also note that the adaptivity of the procedure is simpler with the sky Hough method since each hough map is done for a single sky position. The text suggests that this new method is appropriate for situations where the source position is known and only the source frequency and spin down need to be estimated. Additionally, they are working on studying the efficiency of this method in terms of rejection of spurious lines in the peakmap. They expect this new method to be much more insensitive to the presence of spurious lines since in the chosen hough plane, spurious lines and gravitational wave signals should have a very different and well-separable behavior.  The text cites several papers related to the Hough transform search for continuous gravitational waves, improved Hough search for gravitational wave pulsars, the short FFT database and the peakmap for the hierarchical search of periodic sources, evaluation of sensitivity and computing power for the Virgo hierarchical search for periodic sources, adaptive Hough transform for the search of periodic sources, coincidence analysis between periodic source candidates in C6 and C7 Virgo data, first coincidence search among periodic gravitational wave source candidates using Virgo data, and incoherent strategies for the network detection of periodic gravitational waves.

 The given text summarizes the current state of research on supernova (SN) progenitors based on direct observations of pre-SN images. Here's a brief summary:  1. Type II-plateau SN (SNe II-P): Eight putative progenitor detections and 12 upper luminosity limits have been established for this category, suggesting that red supergiants (RSG) are their immediate progenitors. However, the mass constraint on SNe II-P progenitors is surprising since RSG up to @xmath32 masses are observed in the local group and should have been detected in pre-SN images. This leads researchers to speculate that massive RSG progenitors may be forming black holes without SN explosions. 2. Type II-linear SN (SNe II-L): Only one SN II-L (SN 1980k) has a pre-SN image, which rules out massive RSG greater than about @xmath33. The progenitor mass range for this type of SN is not yet conclusively determined. 3. Type IIn SN: SN 2005gl is the only example with a detected progenitor in pre-SN images, and its massive progenitor's existence does not necessarily indicate that all Type IIn SNe have such massive progenitors. 4. Type Ib/c SN: No detections have been made from analysis of pre-SN images for this class, which is surprising since it is commonly thought that at least some of their progenitors should be luminous, single W-R stars. However, it is unlikely that all SNe Ib/c come from them. 5. Future directions: Researchers are interested in understanding the lack of massive RSG progenitors for SNe II-P and the possibility of a mass cutoff for direct collapse to black holes. They also want to investigate how binarity influences these conclusions. The field is expected to make significant advances in the coming decade.

 This text describes the study of multi-component solitary waves in quasiperiodic quasi-phase matching (QPM) gratings using Fibonacci sequences. The authors have numerically simulated the propagation of a fundamental beam through a QPM grating and observed different regimes: linear (diffraction) and nonlinear (self-trapping). In the linear regime, both harmonics are excited but eventually diffract. In the nonlinear regime, self-focusing and mutual self-trapping lead to the formation of spatially localized two-component solitons. The authors also found that the oscillations of the envelope solitons are in phase with the oscillations of the QPM grating, and the amplitude and width of the solitons depend on the effective mismatch between the input beam frequency and the nearest strong peak in the Fibonacci QPM grating spectrum. The results show that quasiperiodic envelope solitons can be generated for a broad range of phase-mismatch values. The authors also mention other examples of multi-component solitary waves in nonlinear optical fibers and waveguides, such as multi-wavelength solitary waves in multi-channel bit-parallel wavelength fiber transmission systems and multi-color parametric spatial solitary waves due to multistep cascading in quadratic materials. The work was supported by the Australian Photonics Cooperative Research Centre and a collaborative Australia-Denmark grant of the Department of Industry, Science, and Tourism (Australia).

 This text describes a study on the entanglement of a four-particle system consisting of two three-level atoms interacting with a cavity mode. The authors calculate the joint von Neumann entropy of the relevant subsystems using the reduced density matrix and show that it never becomes negative during the evolution, indicating the satisfaction of the strong subadditivity inequality (SSI). They also discuss the time variation of the system and the corresponding changes in entanglement between the atoms and the cavity mode. The authors suggest that the parameter @xmath72 could serve as a measure of entanglement in the four-particle entangled state under consideration.  The text includes several references to relevant works on quantum entanglement, including papers by Bennett et al., Peres, Horodecki et al., and Sackett et al. The authors also mention the stimulated Raman adiabatic technique used to prepare the four-particle entangled state and provide specific citations for these studies.  The text is written in a formal and technical style, with mathematical equations and symbols used extensively to describe the system and the calculations performed on it. The authors use terms such as "subsystems," "reduced density matrix," "entanglement measurement," and "strong subadditivity inequality" to discuss various aspects of the quantum system under study.  The text also includes figures (Figs. 1, 2, and 3) that illustrate the time variation of different quantities in the system, such as the coefficients @xmath76, @xmath77, @xmath78, and @xmath79, and the joint von Neumann entropy @xmath72. These figures help to clarify the evolution of the system and the changes in entanglement between the subsystems.  Overall, this text provides a detailed analysis of the entanglement properties of a four-particle quantum system consisting of two atoms interacting with a cavity mode. The authors demonstrate the importance of the strong subadditivity inequality for understanding the behavior of such systems and suggest that the parameter @xmath72 could serve as a useful measure of entanglement in this context.

 The paper you have provided discusses the results of a study on pulsating subgiant (SPBsg) stars, specifically focusing on the emergence of blue loops and their dependence on metallicity and effective temperature. The key findings are as follows:  1. An inward overshooting from the outer convective zone during the red giant branch (RGB) phase is essential for the appearance of blue loops. 2. Lower metallicities in main sequence and shell hydrogen burning models decrease pulsational instability, while effective temperature plays a more significant role in blue loop models. 3. Blue loops exhibit larger extensions and have driving layers located at the proper place for pulsation excitation. 4. Unstable modes were found in blue loop models with metallicities as low as 10^-3. 5. The behavior of the instability parameter (χ^2) differs between models before and after core helium ignition. 6. In models undergoing shell hydrogen burning, only partial reflection of pulsation modes at the icz is sufficient to drive instability, while on blue loops, the mode must be almost entirely reflected for instability. 7. Based on the analysis of HD 163899 and comparing properties before and after core helium ignition, it was suggested that SPBsg stars should undergo shell hydrogen burning instead of core helium burning on the blue loop. 8. Mode identification from multicolor photometry is applicable to SPBsg stars, making multi-color photometry for HD 163899 desirable.  The study was financially supported by Polish NCN grants 2013/09/n/st9/00611, 2011/01/m/st9/05914, and 2011/01/M/ST9/00788.  References: - Paxton, B., Cantiello, M., Arras, P., et al. (2013).

 This text discusses the results of a study on the existence and properties of interfaces between two quantum gases, specifically a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and a quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) gas. The study investigates three types of interfaces: domain walls (DWS), bubble-drops (BDS), and bright-dark solitons (BDSS).  The researchers found that the BDS exist only in the form of a TG drop immersed into a BEC background, while the BDS complexes can be built equally well with TG bright and BEC dark components or vice versa. The study also suggests new experiments with tightly confined two-species mixtures of ultracold bosonic gases and can be extended to study chains of BDS and/or DBSS in a long system, including a circular one, which corresponds to the binary gas loaded into a tight toroidal trap.  The text acknowledges valuable discussions with M. Salerno and financial support from Italian research programs.

 Title: Flight Management Infrastructure for Astronomical Observations: Addressing Unique Constraints and Challenges  Abstract: This paper introduces the Flight Management Infrastructure (FMI) product designed to minimize aircraft interference with preplanned astronomical observations. FMI consists of a planning component, which can run on the ground and in the air, and an execution component that runs in the air. The planning component manages a set of ordered observations and optional aircraft repositioning requests, while the execution component compares the plan to actual conditions in flight and requests headings from the autopilot.  The astronomical observation context differs significantly from satellite or ground-based observatory planning due to the importance of target history and the need for considering entire flight series at once for greater target variety. FMI's flight planning and execution also differ from conventional methods, as astronomical observations require an astronomically-aware airborne monitoring function to compare current conditions with the plan and adjust fuel consumption based on unexpected winds or external constraints.  FMI requires substantial input data, including weather forecast time series and aircraft performance data, to accurately predict a flight track and its constraints. The paper discusses the simulation environment used for testing FMI components and integrating other systems, as well as the unique challenges of astronomical observation flight planning due to geometrical and practical constraints, external constraints, and science-driven constraints.  The authors conclude that FMI provides a connection between scientific needs of an observatory with the practical constraints of operating an aircraft without introducing excessive safety considerations or pilot workload or planner effort. The paper is based on research by Brggenwirth et al. (2009), Frank et al. (2004), Uppala et al. (2005), and was published in the 16th Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence.

 This text describes a study on the dipole-dipole interaction in two four-level systems with macroscopic light and dark periods. The authors employed Bloch equations as well as a direct quantum jump approach to calculate transition rates between different light and dark periods. They found that for two d-systems, the effect of the dipole-dipole interaction is similar in magnitude to what was observed for two v-systems and is up to 30% for distances of the order of a wave length of the strong transition and about 5% around ten wave lengths, when compared to independent systems. However, for longer distances, they are practically absent, which is in agreement with experimental results. The authors also recovered the special case where distances satisfying a certain condition were considered and showed that the explicitly determined second-order terms are negligibly small. For the effective model of two Ba@x0 systems, the results yield very small and hardly observable cooperative effects for the double jump rate, which is at odds with experimental results. The method also applies to three Ba@x0 ions but requires another paper for detailed calculations. The authors also observed that the magnitude of cooperative effects due to the dipole-dipole interaction sensitively depends on how the meta-stable level is populated. The text provides a detailed explanation of the procedure for calculating transition rates in a single system and extends it to two dipole interacting systems.

 This text appears to be discussing the concept of quiver mutation and its relationship to a certain category called @xmath576 in mathematics. The authors are proving that an algorithm for performing quiver mutation correctly yields the same result as coloured quiver mutation, which is a specific way of mutating a quiver. They also describe the structure of the category @xmath576 and its relationship to basic tilting objects.  The text begins by discussing how to perform quiver mutation by introducing new vertices and arrows based on certain conditions. They then introduce the concept of coloured quiver mutation, which involves adding colours to the arrows based on the number of edges between certain vertices. The authors prove that these two methods yield the same result.  Next, they describe the structure of a category called @xmath576, which is related to basic tilting objects through quadrangulations and diameters of gons. They explain how to obtain the quadrangulation corresponding to a given tilting object by rotating diagonals within hexagons. The text ends with an example of two quadrangulations corresponding to different tilting objects.

 This text appears to be a portion of a research document related to the calculation of contributions to the mass difference between the charged Higgs boson and the neutral Higgs boson in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The equations presented involve various functions, masses, and couplings of particles in the MSSM.  The text begins by introducing some notation for the gradient with respect to the mass scale @xmath124 in the minimal renormalization scheme (MR scheme). It then separates the contribution from diagrams with charged Higgs bosons and charginos, and provides expressions for each of these contributions.  The contribution from diagrams with internal charged Higgs bosons involves the masses of the top quark and the charged Higgs boson, as well as the couplings between the particles. The contribution from diagrams with internal charginos involves the chargino masses, stop mass eigenvalues, and couplings between the particles.  The text also includes some references to earlier works in the field, including papers by Fayet et al., Dimopoulos and Georgi, and Witten, among others. It concludes with a list of references for further reading on the topic.

 This text describes the application of the Nikhilam Sutra, a method from Vedic mathematics, to binary number multiplication. The Nikhilam Sutra is used to convert large-digit multiplication into small-digit multiplication with fewer operations. The text provides an example of multiplying two 264-bit numbers using the standard long multiplication method and the Karatsuba algorithm, as well as using the Nikhilam Sutra. It also discusses the efficiency of the Nikhilam Sutra when both multiplicand and multiplier are near to some base power and suggests future work on extending this method to large-digit multiplication for faster integer multiplications. The text also mentions that for small to medium size numbers, the Nikhilam multiplication can be used alone or in conjunction with other fast algorithms like Karatsuba multiplication.

 This text appears to be a research abstract in English, discussing the work of Batsleer and Dejonghe (1995) on modeling galactic distribution functions using triaxial potentials. They reduced the triple integral defining their moments to a simpler form by making certain assumptions about the parameters and showed that these distribution functions exhibit disc-like features with finite extent in the vertical direction, an exponential decline in the galactic plane, and favor almost circular orbits. The authors also demonstrated that these functions can introduce anisotropy by varying the parameters responsible for this dependence. They further showed that a van der Kruit disc can be modeled using a linear combination of such distribution functions with an explicit dependence on the third integral and realistic anisotropy in velocity dispersions. These models are promising tools to analyze real data, such as Hipparcos data, by employing the quadratic programming algorithm described by Dejonghe (1989). The authors thank Alain Jorissen for his assistance and Stephen Levine for his valuable suggestions during manuscript review.  The text also includes references to various other works in the field of galactic astronomy, such as Abramowitz and Stegun's Handbook of Mathematical Functions (1972), Binney and Merrifield's Galactic Astronomy (1998), and Dehnen and Gerhard's "Modelling Galaxies" (1993).

 This text describes a study on the relaxation dynamics of a single-level quantum dot (QD) with Coulomb interaction and tunnel coupled to a reservoir. The authors find three different relaxation rates: one for charge, one for spin, and an additional rate independent of energy level and interaction strength. They also discuss the implications of these findings for different setups, such as a QD proximized by a superconductor and coupled to a normal reservoir, and a QD coupled to a ferromagnetic lead.  The text uses mathematical notation to describe the system and its evolution. The Hamiltonian for the non-interacting case is given by @xmath229 and @xmath230, with relaxation rates @xmath229 and @xmath230 respectively. The presence of a ferromagnetic contact leads to an additional factor @xmath231, which vanishes for the isolated QD and stems from the combined effect of the Coulomb interaction and the breaking of spin symmetry.  The authors find that the sum of the energy-dependent relaxation rates equals @xmath78 in the hybrid and normal systems, as long as the tunnel coupling is treated in first order only. They also study the time scales present in the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the QD and propose the time evolution of the square deviations of the charge from its equilibrium value as a physical quantity related to processes involving two particles leading to the rate @xmath78.  The authors analyze the response of the system to specific variations of interaction strength @xmath6 and level position @xmath5, finding that @xmath104 can be extracted from time-resolved measurements of the current passing through a nearby quantum point contact. They also discuss the implications of their findings for other setups, such as a dot proximized by a superconductor and coupled to a normal reservoir, and a dot coupled to a ferromagnetic lead.  The text includes mathematical equations describing the transition matrix for the normal case in the eigenbasis of the isolated QD, given by @xmath234, and discusses the implications of non-hermitian matrices for the system. The authors also provide examples of how to calculate expectation values of quantum dot operators using the reduced density matrix and vector representation.

 This text describes an analysis of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) data obtained from two experiments, Hires-I and Hires-II. The authors have calculated the aperture for each experiment using the same binning and normalized the MC distributions to have the same area as the data. They then compare the data and MC distributions in the top plots and show their ratio in the bottom plots. With confidence in the calculated apertures, they extract the flux from Hires-I and Hires-II, which are shown in Figure 3 with triangles for Hires-I and circles for Hires-II. The solid line is a two-component fit to the data consisting of a galactic and extragalactic spectrum.  The authors have motivated their analysis by Occam's Razor and assuming that UHECR sources are distributed throughout the universe and evolve in density in the same way as luminous matter in galaxies. They also add a phenomenologically motivated galactic spectrum at lower energies. The extragalactic component of the spectrum is assumed to consist of protons with a power law spectrum at the source, modified by energy losses as UHECRs traverse the intergalactic medium. The authors use the energy loss formalism from Berezinsky et al. and assume sources to be uniformly distributed out to a redshift of z = 0.2, with a density at any given redshift modified by the observed density of galaxies at that redshift.  The galactic component of the spectrum is assumed to consist of iron nuclei due to the Fly's Eye composition measurement, which shows an approximately linear change from a heavy composition (iron) to a light one (protons). The spectral form is assumed to be a power law multiplied by a linear factor going from unity at 10^15 eV to zero at 10^17 eV.  The authors claim that their model fits the data well due to its agreement with three features: a drastic reduction in flux above the GZK energy, which is also observed in the data but not yet statistically significant; the "second knee" and "ankle," which are the result of electron pair production; and the pion production feature (the GZK cutoff).  The authors have also fitted the recent preliminary measurements from Hires using a two-component model, which conforms to the expectation of a nearly uniform distribution of sources modified by the observed distribution of luminous matter and its evolution as a function of redshift. They claim that this model fits all the recognized features of the UHECR spectrum, not just the GZK cutoff.  The authors comment on the discrepancies between Hires and ASA, with ASA seeing no evidence for the GZK cutoff, and Hires being consistent with its presence. However, they note that below the GZK cutoff, the two experiments agree nicely in the shape of the spectrum, with only an offset in the flux, which can be attributed to a difference in energy scale within the stated systematic uncertainty of either experiment.  The authors acknowledge their colleagues in the Hires collaboration for the realization of this work and express gratitude for their support from the US NSF grant PHY 0073057.

 Geometry is the study of the properties and relationships of space, particularly with regard to shape, size, position, and the connections between these concepts. In the context of physics, geometry plays a fundamental role in describing the structure of space-time and the behavior of physical objects within it.  In the text provided, A. Rylov discusses his research on the Dirac particle and the role of geometry in understanding its properties. He proposes a new conception of space-time based on tubular geometry and argues that this approach may lead to a revised understanding of the Dirac particle and other elementary particles.  Rylov also touches upon the limitations of the conventional approach to space-time geometry, which he argues is incomplete and may not capture the true nature of space-time. He suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of all possible space-time geometries could lead to new insights into the behavior of physical systems.  The text also mentions the discovery of electron diffraction and the development of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as factors that led physicists away from a purely geometric approach to microcosm physics in favor of the more abstract framework of quantum theory. However, Rylov argues that capacities of the geometrical approach are vast and could provide a more complete understanding if all possible space-time geometries are considered.  Overall, the text highlights the importance of geometry in understanding physical systems and the potential benefits of exploring new geometric frameworks to gain insights into the behavior of particles and other physical phenomena.

 This text discusses the search for planets using microlensing, a technique that observes the gravitational lensing effect of a star on the light from a background star as a planet passes in front. The text mentions several specific events where anomalies were observed but could not be explained by a planetary model, and other cases where no anomaly was detected despite suggestions of a possible planet. The text also discusses the current limitations and future possibilities of microlensing for detecting and characterizing planets, including the detection of Jovian planets at large orbital radii and the potential sensitivity to Neptune-mass planets. Challenges include the diluting effect of finite source size on the magnification gradient and the difficulty of detecting Earth-mass planets with reasonable efficiency. The text also mentions possible future developments, such as large-aperture spectroscopy and astrometric microlensing, which could yield more information about the masses and parameters of lensing planets.

 This text appears to be a scientific paper about the analysis of maser data in relation to the dynamics of the galaxy. The authors find that the present maser data do not lead to a significant improvement of our knowledge of the mass and angular rotation speed at the sun's radius, as most of the information in the data is used to determine the properties of the conditional velocity distribution of the masers. They also note that the distribution function of the masers likely depends on the galactocentric radius and that more detailed measurements of the potential of the galaxy using larger samples of masers will be limited by our lack of knowledge about the distribution function of the masers. The authors use a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to explore the posterior probability distribution and find that the maser data themselves only weakly constrain the mass and angular rotation speed at the sun's radius. They also present figures showing the mean motion of the masers in various directions, as well as their apocenter and current radii as a function of galactocentric radius in a spherically symmetric logarithmic potential.

 This text describes a study on the $\Delta^{++}$(1p, γp) reaction using polarized beams under reversed quasifree kinematics. The data is presented in five energy intervals and is compared to previous results obtained under different experimental conditions. The authors find agreement between the measurements within uncertainties and conclude that their work provides the first measurements of this reaction with a polarized beam using the quasifree collision process under reversed kinematics. They also observe anisotropy effects at resonance and significant analyzing powers in dependence of deuteron and pion angles, which can be explained by interference of the $\Delta^{++}$ resonance amplitude with background amplitudes. The work was supported by various grants and acknowledges valuable discussions with C. Hanhart. References to previous works are provided.

 This text appears to be discussing the results of observations and analyses of stellar clusters, specifically in relation to their luminosity functions (LFs) and mass functions (MFs), as well as the impact of metallicity on these functions. The authors find that while dynamical histories may play a role in shaping the LFs of globular clusters, they are not the primary cause of the observed turn-overs in the LFs. Instead, the rapidly increasing slope of the mass-luminosity (ML) relation at lower masses is responsible for these turn-overs. The authors also note that the low mass MF is relatively independent of metallicity and suggest that this implies a universal initial mass function (IMF) across different environments and metallicities. They present new data on cluster LFs using HST and find evidence supporting an invariant IMF and a metallicity-dependent ML relation.

 This text appears to be describing data from an imaging experiment using a detector with multiple channels, each channel having different wavelength ranges and resolutions. The data includes measurements of slice widths at the detector, pixel sizes along slices, fields of view (FOV) across slices, sub-band wavelength ranges, and resolutions for each channel. Additionally, there are mentions of dichroic filters labeled as 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, and 3c, with their corresponding wavelength ranges. The text also includes some numerical data for channel-specific parameters such as peak values (a, b, c) and pixel counts.  The figures mentioned in the text seem to be comparing the measured data from the detector (m) with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the JWST pupil and normalized peak profiles of the measured and modeled data for both the along-slice and across-slice directions. The x-axis is multiplied by two in the lower figures.

 This text discusses the development and challenges of using number counting Jastrow factors for molecular simulations, specifically in the context of ethene dissociation. The authors demonstrate that 4-body real space Jastrow factors with suitable jastrow basis functions can perform strong wave function stenciling, eliminating ionic terms between well-separated molecular fragments and restoring size consistency.  The key development for effective stenciling was the introduction of new 4-body Jastrow basis functions using smoothed indicator functions to check whether electrons are within a given region of space. These counting functions have minimal curvature except at their boundaries, allowing them to participate in strong stenciling while hiding their curvature in regions of small wave function magnitude.  However, the main challenge is to formulate these number counting Jastrow factors for black-box treatments of arbitrary molecules, enabling the variational principle to automatically demarcate important regions for electron counting and control. The authors acknowledge funding from the US Department of Energy and performed calculations using the Berkeley Research Computing Savio Cluster.

The authors discuss the uniqueness of a particular set of observables (denoted as [newoptimal]) and their ability to minimize errors on extracted parameters in the limit of large statistics. They also mention that similar results hold when using the product of cross sections measured with fixed luminosity instead of individual cross sections.  The text includes references to several other works, including papers, reports, and workshops in the field of particle physics. Some of these references are cited multiple times throughout the text. The authors discuss linear reparametrizations and their importance in maintaining the optimality of observables when using different measurement techniques. Overall, the text appears to be a contribution to the ongoing research on extracting couplings from high energy collider experiments and optimizing observables for improved precision.

 This text appears to be discussing the results of simulations and observations related to the metallicity distribution of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). The authors are comparing their simulation results with observations and previous studies, and discussing potential explanations for the discrepancies.  The authors find that the metallicity distribution obtained from their simulations is quite different from the predictions of Lanfranchi & Matteucci (2004), particularly at low metallicities. They suggest that this may be due to assumptions made in the Lanfranchi & Matteucci study about the infall history of gas inside the galaxy and complete mixing of gas, which do not accurately reflect the conditions in dsphs.  The authors also note that their simulations indicate a large spread (of the order of 1 dex) in the metallicities of stars formed after the very early stages of the simulations. They suggest possible solutions to the problem of the dearth of observed very metal-poor stars (vmpss) in dsphs, including pre-enrichment of the gas up to a metallicity of ~-3 or a difference between the present and primordial initial mass function (IMF).  The text includes references to several studies and authors in the field. Some of the key references mentioned include Battaglia et al. (2006), Grebel et al.

 This text appears to be discussing the results of a study on the behavior of wave functions in a non-Hermitian quantum system. The authors find that under certain conditions, the system exhibits reflectionless absorption and self-sustained emission, which could have applications in quantum devices.  The study involves analyzing the time evolution of wave functions described by a Hamiltonian with a complex potential. The authors find that the imaginary part of the potential corresponds to the momentum of a unidirectional plane wave, as determined by equation ([potentialk]). They also show that the reflectionless absorption can be measured experimentally by observing the reflection coefficients of incoming wavepackets.  The authors suggest that the optimal conditions for achieving reflectionless absorption are given by equations ([@xmath142]) and require a specific value of the complex potential and momentum of the corresponding reflectionless wave. They verify this analysis through numerical simulations of two incoming wavepackets with different momenta and initial centers. The results show that the wider wavepacket leads to a lower reflection rate, as predicted by theory.  The study also explores the underlying mechanism of non-Hermitian quantum systems, showing that the balance between a finite non-Hermitian cluster and an infinite semi-chain can result in a full real spectrum. The threshold for this balance is the exceptional point of the semi-infinite non-Hermitian system, where eigenstates undergo a delocalization-localization transition and exhibit unidirectional plane wave behavior.  The authors suggest that these phenomena could be useful for designing quantum devices, such as those based on self-sustained emission and reflectionless absorption. They cite several related works in the field for further reading.

 Title: Derivation of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann Thermal Activation Law in Bulk Polymer Glasses through Quantum Mechanical Considerations  Abstract: The Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) thermal activation law has been extensively studied in bulk polymer systems due to its significance in understanding the glass transition dynamics. This law, given by eq.([intro1]) in the paper, is a modification of the Arrhenius thermal activation law with a temperature singularity in the denominator. The singularity temperature @xmath2 is lower than the thermodynamic glass transition temperature @xmath3 and is never quite attained. In this study, we aim to derive the VFT thermal activation law using simple quantum mechanical considerations.  We begin by discussing the activation energy required to remove a polymer chain section from a condensed matter piece of polymer. If the given section is deep within the polymer, removal would be difficult due to entanglement with other chains. However, if the given section is near the surface boundary, it would be relatively easier to peel off the chain. We then focus on the activation energy required to slide a section of polymer chain along a given path, which we denote as @xmath32 per link of the chain section.  Our derivation relies on the micro-canonical counting of closed polymer chain configurations within the bulk glassy system. This configuration counting is mapped into the self-avoiding polygon problem. The activation energy @xmath18 per link determines both the chain mobility and the dynamical glass transition temperature in the empirical VFT law. We calculate the critical indices employed using Flory's theory, and the chain movements provide strong support for cooperative motion inside the bulk.  Furthermore, we discuss the surface effect on the dynamical glass transition temperature @xmath42, which varies with the distance from the surface boundary through a coherence length scale of about a few nanometers. For sufficiently thin films, the VFT activation law becomes modified as in eqs. ([se1]-[se3]). Our derivation provides insights into the VFT thermal activation law and its implications for polymer glass dynamics.

 This text describes a study on polarization squeezing in an X-like 4-level atoms ensemble illuminated by a linearly polarized light in an optical cavity. The authors have traced the polarization jitter to self-rotation and presented clear criteria for understanding switching effects and the multistable behavior of the system.  The steady state analysis reveals interesting working points for squeezing, and the contributions of self-rotation (SR) and saturation have been investigated and compared to a full quantum calculation. Since SR's propensity for squeezing is canceled by atomic noise at low frequencies, squeezing originates from the Kerr effect.  The mean field mode is squeezed via saturation effects, while vacuum mode squeezing is induced by the mean field through crossed Kerr effect. Both SR and crossed Kerr effects can be dissociated in a bad cavity configuration, allowing for high squeezing values.  The text also provides expressions for the susceptibility matrix (@xmath183) and correlation matrix (@xmath184) for field @xmath126. In the high frequency limit, they reduce to those derived earlier in [xcite]. The matrices for field @xmath123 can be obtained by taking @xmath235 equal to @xmath236.  This matrix approximates the atoms ensemble as a Kerr medium: the first-order term is linear dephasing, the second-order matrix represents dispersion and absorption, and the third-order term is nonlinear dephasing corresponding to the Kerr effect. The associated correlation matrix shows that in the Kerr limit, atomic noise comes only from frequency-independent linear losses of the Kerr medium, acting as a beamsplitter for the field.  Similar matrices can be derived for field @xmath123 in agreement with [ax1]. However, at low frequencies, these matrices need to be completed by additional terms (@xmath240sr) to account for SR noise. For frequencies of the order of @xmath162, a lot of noise is reported on all quadratures of @xmath126 due to SR noise, as discussed in sec [faradaysection]. For frequencies @xmath173, the sr noise terms vanish, allowing for crossed kerr effect to produce squeezing.

 Title: An Alternative to Primordial Quintessence for Dark Energy: Decaying Dark Matter as a Quintessential Field  Abstract: The enigma of dark energy and the cosmological constant persists, requiring explanations for both the smallness of the cosmological constant and the coincidence problem. While models inspired by string theory and anthropical models offer potential solutions, they each face challenges in addressing these issues. In this study, we propose an alternative: decaying dark matter (DDM) as a quintessential field. DDM is motivated by the violation of R-parity in supersymmetric models or the search for sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We demonstrate that a small fraction of primary DDM particles decaying into a scalar field can explain quintessence behavior, with the yield and correlation between dark matter and quintessential energy emerging naturally. However, we only investigate the plausibility of this model in this work and postpone a more detailed study for future research. We consider the natural choice of cosmological parameters at the time of CMB decoupling and discuss the implications for hot dark matter and the evolution of various types of matter. Our preliminary results suggest that this model can provide a consistent explanation for the present value of cosmological parameters without fine tuning, while also distinguishing it from other quintessence models through the measurement of cosmological parameters at high redshift. However, several important issues remain to be addressed, including the condensation of the scalar field and the time-varying effective mass of the cosmological constant or quintessence matter.

 Title: Heavy Hadronic Molecules: A Study of Heavy Meson-Doubly Heavy Baryons using HQSS, HFS, and Hads Symmetries  Abstract: The existence of heavy hadronic molecules, composed of a pair of heavy hadrons instead of heavy quarks, has been theorized since the 1970s based on similarities with the heavy meson-antimeson system and the deuteron. However, experimental evidence was first observed in the discovery of X(3872) by the Belle collaboration in 2003. In this work, we utilize Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS), Heavy Quark Flavor Symmetry (HFS), and Heavy-Quark Diquark Symmetry (Hads) to investigate a family of heavy meson-doubly heavy baryons that could also be interpreted as triply heavy pentaquarks. We begin by introducing our Effective Field Theory (EFT) based on these symmetries, followed by the derivation of potentials in various channels using Racah algebra. The results predict several molecular partners for X(3872) and X(1650), with sources of error including resonance masses, decay ratios, and two EFT expansions. Future work includes applying this approach to doubly heavy baryon-double heavy antibaryon molecular systems.

 This text describes how different types of truncated sums, such as Fourier, Gauss, Kummer, and exponential sums, can emerge from oscillations in optics. The authors consider the case where three parameters are fixed for all oscillations, while the fourth parameter is varied. They use the example of an interferometer to explain how electric fields from different arms combine in the detector, resulting in various types of truncated sums.  The authors also discuss factorizing a number using these truncated sums and propose several implementations in optics. They suggest that if this algorithm can be extended to entangled quantum systems, it could lead to an alternative quantum factorization algorithm. The work was supported by various grants and the author acknowledges contributions from N. Vitanov and is aware of related work by Tamma et al.

 The theorem you are trying to prove, named "nobound," states that it is possible to learn arbitrary computable classifiers in the statistical learning paradigm. However, the number of samples required by a computable learning algorithm may become arbitrarily large depending on the sample distribution. In contrast, uncomputable learning methods have bounded sample complexity independently of the distribution.  To prove theorem "nobound," you are showing that there exists a fixed concept @xmath79 that behaves as bad target concepts in arbitrary instances of lemma "probabilisticmethod." The proof involves designing a program @xmath99 that simulates the learning algorithm @xmath0 for different labelings and computes the probability that it queries more than a given number of samples. By using lemma "probabilisticmethod," you can show that if the target concept is @xmath79 and the distribution is uniform over certain points, then the probability that @xmath0 requests more than a specified number of samples is at least a given probability.  However, there are some limitations to this proof: 1. The analysis ignores computation time, making the learning algorithm impractical in real-world scenarios. 2. A measure for comparing different learning algorithms based on sample complexity is needed. 3. The results show that there's a significant price in terms of sample complexity when combining universality and computability in a learner. By tweaking the distribution, you can make a computable universal learner arbitrarily worse than a restricted learning algorithm or even an uncomputable universal learner.  To address these limitations, future work could include: 1. Integrating running time into the theory to create a more practical and realistic analysis. 2. Developing a measure for comparing different learning algorithms based on sample complexity. 3. Investigating ways to reduce the sample complexity of computable universal learners while maintaining their universality.

 This text describes a study on the high energy behavior of longitudinal gauge boson scattering in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, focusing on the role of electroweak logarithmic corrections. The authors find that these corrections significantly suppress the amplitude and cross section at high energies compared to the tree level result due to the presence of Sudakov logarithms. However, they note that unitarity is still violated near the Landau pole of the quartic coupling, even with the Sudakov suppression.  The authors also discuss how the impact of electroweak logarithmic corrections on unitarity depends on the Higgs mass. For lighter masses, these corrections push the scale where unitarity is broken closer to the Landau pole energy scale, restoring unitarity except in the immediate vicinity of the pole. In contrast, for heavier masses, the Landau pole appears close to the Higgs mass, and electroweak logarithms do not have a significant effect on unitarity.  The text includes references to several papers by Chiu et al., Bauer et al., Kidonakis et al., Arason et al., and others. The research is supported by the US Department of Energy and other grants.

 This text describes a study on the gas-to-dust ratio and carbon monoxide (CO) abundance in protoplanetary disks. The authors compiled dust mass data from previous studies, which were estimated using simple disk models with assumed gas-to-dust ratios of 100. They found that the CO abundance, represented by @xmath60, is significantly lower for transitional disks (TTSS) compared to protoplanetary disks (PSS). This difference can be explained by either a reduced carbon monoxide abundance or gas-to-dust ratio.  The former case suggests that the carbon monoxide abundance decreases as star formation progresses due to its short chemical lifetime in denser environments. The latter case implies that the gas in the disk must be depleted to a low level to explain the CO abundance decrease. However, an overall gas depletion is unlikely since the observed intensity can be reproduced by a nominal gas-to-dust ratio model.  An alternative explanation is the depletion of volatiles such as CO-containing species at the surface with disk evolution. The authors propose a time-dependent sink mechanism for CO based on observational data of HD and CO isotopologue lines.  The text also acknowledges the staff of ASTE (Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment) for their support, thanks H. Nomura and D. Ishimoto for fruitful discussions, and mentions the grants that supported T.T. and M.M.

 It appears that the text describes various states of a system, represented by symbols such as @xmath145, @xmath156, @xmath279, @xmath280, etc. The behavior of these states depends on certain parameters, particularly @xmath12.  In case i@xmath142, where @xmath145 is dominant, there is an influx of @xmath62 molecules that prevents @xmath53 from decreasing to zero. This keeps the system in a 2-4 rich state. For large values of @xmath12, there is a single peak around @xmath292, which corresponds to the fixed point in the continuum limit.  In case ii, where the @xmath62 influx is rare, @xmath53 can reach zero before the switching occurs, making the 2-4 rich state unstable. For large values of @xmath12, there are double peaks around @xmath293 and @xmath294, which correspond to the 2-4 rich state. As @xmath12 decreases, these peaks spread apart, and at a certain point (@xmath189), the skirt of the low-density (left) peak touches @xmath295, implying that @xmath52 (and @xmath53) is likely to reach zero, causing the 2-4 rich state to lose stability. A new peak at @xmath295 grows steeply as @xmath12 decreases further.  For small values of @xmath12 and for @xmath296 and @xmath232 with inequivalent reaction constants, the flows of molecules dominate the system. The behavior of these states does not depend on how the continuum limit is imbalanced by the reactions. Instead, there are two distinct states represented by @xmath298 and @xmath299 or @xmath300 and @xmath301.  The text includes several figures (reproduced from ref.) that illustrate these findings.

 This text describes a study on white dwarfs, specifically focusing on one ultramassive white dwarf named J1926+3703. The researchers did not observe any photometric variability in this white dwarf using ground-based observations to a limit of roughly 6.9 parts per thousand (ppt), but it is possible that the pulsations have lower amplitudes. They encourage further monitoring of this white dwarf and other unobserved white dwarfs within the empirical instability strip.  The researchers used photometric color selection from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KIS) and subsequent medium-resolution spectroscopy from ISIS on the William Herschel Telescope to discover and characterize 42 new white dwarfs in the original Kepler mission field. Nine of these objects were confirmed as ZZ Ceti stars using follow-up high-speed photometry from ground-based telescopes, and four were observed from space using the Kepler space telescope.  Unfortunately, the failure of the second reaction wheel on the Kepler spacecraft occurred shortly after the discovery of many of these new ZZ Ceti stars, leaving sparse ground-based discovery light curves as the only time-series photometry for most targets. The authors acknowledge support from various funding agencies and organizations, including the European Research Council, NASA, and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).  The text also mentions that the two-reaction-wheel controlled K2 mission will cover a significantly larger footprint as it tours the ecliptic and is expected to observe more than a thousand white dwarfs, dozens of them pulsating. Several important discoveries have already been made from these observations of pulsating white dwarfs. The authors acknowledge fruitful conversations with A. Gianninas during the preparation of this manuscript.

 This text describes a study where the authors created artificial clusters with assumed underlying initial mass functions (IMFs) and calculated the probability of observing the observed ratio of stars to brown dwarfs for each cluster. They then compared these probabilities with the distribution of binary-to-total population ratios (BTPs) obtained from their simulations. The results indicate that a falling power law IMF is consistent with the observations, as only a small fraction of simulations had lower probabilities when assuming this IMF. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for various ideas put forward to explain the shape of the IMF and the challenges in detecting IMF variations.  The text provides the following information:  1. The authors created seven artificial clusters, each containing 100 objects with masses assigned according to assumed underlying IMFs and determined the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs for each cluster. 2. They calculated the probability of observing that value or higher for each ratio and multiplied these probabilities to obtain an overall probability. 3. The authors compared the observed BTPs with the distribution of BTPs obtained from their simulations assuming four different underlying IMFs: Chabrier, falling power law, flat power law, and rising power law. 4. They found that 37% of the simulations had a probability equal to or lower than what was found assuming a Chabrier IMF, while only 0.36-0.1% of the simulations had probabilities equal to or lower when assuming a falling power law IMF. 5. The authors note that their results are based on the system IMF, which includes binaries unresolved within 200 au and may be difficult to compare directly with locally derived field IMFs. 6. They discuss the implications of their findings for various ideas put forward to explain the shape of the IMF, such as those based on turbulence models and those suggesting that the imf should peak at higher masses in regions with low turbulence. 7. The authors note that detecting IMF variations is challenging due to the inherently stochastic nature of populating an IMF and the need for a larger set of clusters to detect even small imf variations with initial conditions. 8. They provide information on six observed clusters, including their ages, masses, number of stars, number of brown dwarfs, and BTPs.

 In this communication, the authors investigate the curvature effect on Rashba spin-orbit interaction induced spin polarization in a three-terminal bridge setup using a tight-binding framework based on Green's function formalism. They consider two different shaped geometries of the same material: a linear-like and a ring-like geometry.  For the ring-shaped geometry, they find finite polarization in two output leads while observing absolute zero spin polarization when the sample becomes linear. This phenomenon holds true for any higher-terminal bridge setup and independent of lead-conductor interface geometries. Additionally, they suggest that finite spin polarization may be obtained in output leads for other geometric configurations except the linear one, leading to a robust effect of curvature on spin polarization in a multi-terminal bridge system.  The authors analyze their results at absolute zero temperature and note that the finite temperature extension is trivial since the broadening of energy levels due to coupling with side-attached leads is much larger than thermal broadening. They also mention ignoring the effect of electron-electron interaction in this study but suggest possible ways to incorporate it, such as mean field approximation.  The authors emphasize that their results demonstrate the importance of exploring the effect of curvature on spin polarization in a three-terminal bridge setup and encourage experimental verification. They note that while they consider some typical parameter values for their numerical calculations, the absolute unchanged nature of these physical properties for any other set of parameters demands further investigation.

 Title: Adaptive Optics Testbed: Achieving High Strehl Ratios with Multi-Conjugate and Multi-Object Technologies using Tomographic Reconstructions  Abstract: The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics (LAO) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is developing Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO)@xcite and Multi-Object Adaptive Optics (MOAO)@xcite technologies using tomographic reconstructions with multiple reference sources. MCAO aims to achieve high Strehl ratios over a large field of view by accounting for anisoplanatism using multiple deformable mirrors at optical conjugates. MOAO targets very high Strehls over small fields embedded in larger uncorrected fields. The testbed employs three optically addressed Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) from Hamamatsu Photonics, enabling nearly 600,000 control elements. Recent results demonstrate the effectiveness of tomography in finding turbulence layers and achieving high Strehls with both MCAO and MOAO. The testbed also incorporates a high stroke mirror to eliminate the need for SLMs to phase wrap and test possible configurations for future "woofer-tweeter" setups. Initial open-loop results show promising characteristics for the Alpao DM52 mirror as a woofer deformable mirror, with initial results looking good for woofer-tweeter implementation in the MCAO testbed. Previous works include [Beckers 1988], [Tallon et al. 1990], [Ammons et al. 2006], [Awwal et al. 2003], and [Keskin et al. 2006].

 This text discusses the challenges in understanding the spectral origin of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and the role of thermal and non-thermal components in their emission. The authors suggest that a two blackbodies plus powerlaw (2bbpl) model may be a generic spectral shape for GRBs, as they have found evidence of this model in various types of GRBs with different pulse behaviors. They also propose a spine-sheath jet structure to explain the observed emission and plan to develop a model to obtain physical parameters of the jet. The text suggests that the powerlaw component of the 2bbpl model may be related to the high energy (GEV) emission, which is delayed and long-lasting compared to the keV-MEV emission. The authors suggest that this finding validates the 2bbpl model and plan to test its application in studying GRB correlations. The text acknowledges funding from various grants.

 This text appears to be a list of references for a research paper on the rotation properties of neutron stars, specifically focusing on the minimum rotation period of solitary neutron stars born as rapidly rotating protoneutron stars. The authors find that the minimum rotation period is significantly larger than the corresponding limit for cold neutron stars due to the effects of mass shedding and secular instabilities with respect to axi-symmetric perturbations. They also mention that inclusion of additional secular instabilities can strengthen this conclusion.  The references cited include works by Bardeen, DeWitt and DeWitt, Baumgarte, Shapiro and Teukolsky, Bombaci et al., Bonazzola et al., Brown and Bethe, Burrows and Lattimer, Cook and Shapiro, Cutler et al., Friedman and Ipser, Haensel and Zdunik, Hashimoto et al., Janka and Möenchmeyer, Kazanas, Lai and Shapiro, Lattimer and Swesty, Möenchmeyer and Mueller, Nozawa et al., Pandharipande, Pethick and Thorsson, Salgado et al., Sawyer, Soni, Shapiro and Teukolsky, Wasserman, Sorkin, Stergioulas and Takatsuka, Tassoul, Yoshida and Eriguchi, and Zdunik.

 This paper discusses the Flashing Ratchet Model of molecular motors, specifically calculating the velocity-mean squared displacement (MFDR) and deriving the violation integral of the corresponding non-equilibrium Einstein relation for the ratchet's on and off states. The model describes a molecular motor moving along a polymeric track in a strongly fluctuating thermal environment, utilizing intrinsic local asymmetry of the track and chemical energy provided by ATP hydrolysis.  The authors consider a simple two-state approximation of the dynamics of motor proteins, where the motor encounters a locally asymmetric potential. They derive modified Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations (MFDR) at non-equilibrium steady states using the Agarwal formalism and show that all versions of MFDR are intrinsically equivalent.  The results reveal that the steady-state diffusion constant in the flashing ratchet is always suppressed, moving closer to free diffusion for the most asymmetric ratchet. The violation integral quantifies the difference between nonequilibrium and equilibrium, with equilibrium requiring zero net current. The symmetric ratchet does not generate unidirectional motion but keeps the system out of equilibrium.  The authors plan to extend their study to other models of molecular motors, stochastic particle pumps, polymer translocation dynamics, and dynamics of self-propelled particles. They acknowledge support from various funding agencies.

 This text appears to discuss the replicator equation, which is a particular class of differential equations used in evolutionary game theory. The authors begin by describing a system of equations with variables @xmath0, @xmath198, @xmath199, and @xmath200, and a stationary point @xmath202 for the LV equation @xmath201. They then add a constant population of one individual and define a transformation to study the dynamics of the system.  The authors note that due to the periodic behavior of the system, it may not be possible to project the dynamic onto a simplex @xmath210. They go on to discuss the replicator equation as a submanifold of a larger space @xmath223 and introduce a random variable @xmath224. The differential equation for @xmath0 is then referred to as the replicator equation.  The authors consider the simplex @xmath222 as a sub-variety of a larger space @xmath229 and discuss different parametrizations. They compute the Jacobian of the transformation and show that it has certain properties, allowing them to derive a differential equation in the simplex.  The text also mentions univariate statistical models and centered pivotal quantities (vector fields) @xmath289 and @xmath290, and discusses the variation of these quantities over time. However, the connection between the replicator equation and statistical models is not clear without additional context.

 This text appears to be a mathematical proof or description of how to construct wavelet frames using a single dilation matrix and an irregular grid. Here's a summary:  The authors discuss the construction of smooth wavelet frames associated with a single dilation matrix @xmath107 and an irregular grid. They begin by selecting a bounded set @xmath495 that contains both the origin and the support of the wavelet function @xmath17. The wavelet function must be of class @xmath605 and have rapid decay on compact sets.  They then construct a set @xmath609, which is separated and covers the space @xmath4. The collection @xmath612, where @xmath81 is the inverse Fourier transform of @xmath17, forms a frame for @xmath4.  The authors note that, in general, the set @xmath613 from Theorem [wavelet] is not a wavelet frame for @xmath4 when considering a fixed dilation matrix. However, they show that it's still possible to reconstruct a function @xmath343 from its wavelet coefficients using a dual frame of @xmath72.  The authors also discuss the issue of the dual frame not being well-localized and propose a solution by choosing @xmath17 to be in a certain space and ensuring that each @xmath628 is in another specific space, which guarantees polynomial decay in space for the partial sums of the series.  The authors cite previous works on compactly supported tight affine frames with integer dilations and maximum vanishing moments and non-separable radial frame multiresolution analysis in multidimensions and isotropic fast wavelet algorithms.

 This text appears to be discussing the topic of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the epoch of reionization (EOR), specifically focusing on the implications of late reionization at a redshift of z ~ 0.845. The authors suggest that this may require an epoch of partial ionization, which could result in additional optical depth due to early sources of UV/X-ray photons. They also mention ongoing and future observations that can help clarify the situation, such as data from the Planck mission and redshifted 21-cm experiments. The authors are conducting simulations to better capture the heating and clumping in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during reionization, and plan to carry out more detailed modeling of the 21-cm signal.  The text includes several numerical values, which are likely parameters for their simulations or calculations. For example, there are values for redshift, temperature, clumping factor, escape fraction, and stellar atmosphere. There are also values for grid size and number of simulations. It is not clear from the context what these specific values represent without additional information.  The text mentions several studies and experiments, such as WMAP and PRitchard et al. (2010), which have contributed to our understanding of reionization and the CMB optical depth. The authors also acknowledge useful discussions with Joanna Dunkley, Chris Carilli, Richard Ellis, and Piero Madau.  The text ends by thanking the referee for suggesting additional model comparisons and acknowledging support from NASA and NSF grants.

 This text describes a series of steps for performing out-of-sample extension using various methods, including the calculation of pseudo-inverses and orthogonal projections. The goal is to extend a function defined on a dataset to new data points using a multi-scale algorithm called the Laplacian pyramid method.

The presented scheme is efficient and enables the detection of abnormal data points while maintaining low computational cost. The research was supported by various grants and funds.

 This text appears to be a summary or abstract of several research papers and talks on the topic of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), specifically focusing on the chiral symmetry restoration and the appearance of new particles at high temperatures.  The authors discuss how, as the temperature @xmath0 approaches the critical temperature for the chiral transition, pions are expected to lose their Goldstone nature, and the sigma meson would appear as a narrow state. They also mention that the partial width of the @xmath113-meson by strong interaction should vanish in this regime.  The authors present the results of their calculations for the mass ratio of the pions at high temperatures, which almost coincides with a simpler treatment using a mean-field expansion of the effective potential around the critical point in the limit of small quark masses. They also mention that it is premature to discuss experimental signatures for the QCD phase transition based on the behavior of the sigma width.  The authors cite several papers and talks by Stephanov, Berges, Rajagopal, Harada, and Shibata, as well as reviews and references by Satz, Specht, Stock, Jacob, Carruthers, Rafelski, Shuryak, Gross, Pisarski, Yaffe, Cleymans, Matsumoto, Nakano, Umezawa, Kalashnikov, Casalbuoni, Linden, Sinha, and Raha.  The text covers topics such as the chiral symmetry restoration, the appearance of new particles at high temperatures, and the mass ratio of pions as a significant parameter to describe the degree of chiral symmetry breaking at different temperatures.

 This text describes the behavior of the Fano factor in the Coulomb blockade regime of a double quantum dot system, focusing on the impact of temperature on the sharp steps and plateaus observed in transport characteristics. The authors aim to find the cumulant generating function (CGF) to gain insight into the probability of charge transfer through the system during measurement time.  The Fano factor is a measure of the noise in a quantum system, which can reveal interesting information about quantum correlations created during tunneling. In the one-electron blockade region, the Fano factor is super-Poissonian and can be used to determine the interaction parameter between electrons in the double quantum dot. This allows for measuring the degree of entanglement of two electrons in the system.  The text provides expressions for the Fano factor in different regions of the transport characteristics, with temperature affecting the sharp steps and plateaus. The authors also discuss the methodology to evaluate counting statistics using the smallest eigenvalue of the transport matrix.  The results obtained from this analysis are in agreement with numerical calculations, as shown in figures provided. The text concludes by acknowledging the financial support for this work from various organizations and expressing gratitude to D. Loss for useful discussions.  References: [efanc] Y. Zhang, L.

 This text discusses the behavior of thin shells and ropes near black holes in the context of general relativity. The authors argue that a stationary thin shell would violate the weak energy condition when it is arbitrarily close to the horizon, but they challenge this conclusion by assuming that the rope fibers can be considered radial. They derive an expression for the stresses in the rope and show that it satisfies the weak energy condition even when the rope's end is infinitesimally close to the horizon. The authors suggest that a suitably constructed rope could be used to deposit parcels of fluid at rest near the horizon, resolving a paradox discussed in previous works.

 This text appears to be a scientific research paper about the study of ground states in graphene using Su(4) symmetry. The authors have identified various possible fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states in graphene and shown that new composite fermion (CF) ground states, which have no analog in gallium arsenide (GaAs), can occur at certain filling factors in the ν=159 subbands of graphene.  The authors have used a combination of exact diagonalization and CF theory to study the ground states of finite systems on a sphere in the most prominent fractions in the ν=12 and ν=21 Landau levels of graphene. They found that for some composite fermion states, the fully polarized ground state wins, while for others, very compact SU(4) singlet structures are possible.  The authors have also estimated parameter regimes where these states should occur and have found that zero temperature phase transitions can be driven by variation of an effective Zeeman energy that accounts for the combined effect of the Zeeman energy and the sublattice symmetry breaking field. They found SU(4) skyrmions to be the lowest energy charged excitations.  The text includes references to several previous works in the field, including papers by Sondhi et al., Barrett et al., Schmeller et al., Aifer et al., Kamilla et al., Jain et al., and Leadley et al.

 This text appears to be describing the calculation of the star formation rate (SFR) surface density using various observational data, specifically the integrated luminosity of a particular line (h@xmath60 line) and the luminosity of the 24@xmath35 continuum. The SFR surface density is then used to create surface density maps for two galaxies by applying the given equation ([eqb2]) to the h@xmath60 images and Spitzer 24@xmath35 images.  The text also mentions that physical models in [xcite] explore the possible dependence of the x-factor on the star formation rate, and provides a power-law relation ([eqxs2]) for estimating the surface density using CO observations. The text assumes that dust tracers of molecular gas give the correct value of the surface density and applies this equation to obtain parameters for m@xmath051 and m@xmath083 from the fits in figure [fig18].  The text also mentions uncertainties in the measurements, with formal uncertainties being 3-4% and systematics likely dominating the uncertainty in @xmath167. The text then applies equations ([eqxs4]) and ([eqxs5]) to obtain values for @xmath167, which give the value of @xmath14 in @xmath55 units.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:  The SFR within a source is given by equation ([eqb1]), where @xmath142 is the integrated luminosity of the h@xmath60 line, @xmath92 is the frequency corresponding to the wavelength of 24@xmath35, @xmath146 is the luminosity of the 24@xmath35 continuum per unit frequency bandwidth in @xmath147, and @xmath148 and @xmath149 are constants.  The SFR surface density can be calculated using equation ([eqb2]), where @xmath19 is the SFR surface density, @xmath152 is the source solid angle, d is the source distance, @xmath153 is the source flux, and @xmath154 is the source surface brightness.  The text then mentions that for m@xmath051 and m@xmath083, the SFR surface density maps were created by applying equation ([eqb2]) to the h@xmath60 images and Spitzer 24@xmath35 images of both galaxies. The images were then convolved to the appropriate resolution and rebinned to 9@xmath42 pixels, and the @xmath158 image was converted to units of @xmath165.  The text also mentions that physical models in [xcite] explore the possible dependence of the x-factor on the star formation rate, and provides a power-law relation ([eqxs2]) for estimating the surface density using CO observations. The text assumes that dust tracers of molecular gas give the correct value of the surface density and applies this equation to obtain parameters @xmath178 and @xmath174 for m@xmath051 and m@xmath083 from the fits in figure [fig18]. The fits in the fourth panels provide @xmath179 and @xmath171.  The text mentions uncertainties in the measurements, with formal uncertainties being 3-4% and systematics likely dominating the uncertainty in @xmath167. The text then applies equations ([eqxs4]) and ([eqxs5]) to obtain values for @xmath167, which give the value of @xmath14 in @xmath55 units.

 This text describes analytical results obtained from solving master equations of lattice models and corresponding continuum equations for the random walks of molecular motors. The random walks are characterized by repeated binding to and unbinding from filaments, and the analysis considers both systems without confining walls and with confining walls (slabs or tubes).  In the absence of confining walls, the probability to be bound to the filament and the effective velocity behave as power laws with a crossover time. When confining walls are present, the system is analyzed using reflection and superposition methods for slabs and Fourier series for tubes. The results show that at large times, the probability to be bound to the filament and the effective velocity exhibit power-law behavior with a crossover time that depends on the size of the confining space.  These findings are relevant for understanding intracellular phenomena such as slow transport in axons and for designing artificial systems using molecular motors as transporters in nanotechnology.

 This paper explores the possibility of backward time travel and the principle of self-consistency in physics. The authors propose that consistent cycles are only possible in physics, and they examine a specific case using a quantum mechanical device that can be interpreted as an uncontrollable time machine. They calculate the probability of the cycle occurring based on the quantum evolution of the state around the cycle and find that self-consistent cycles have a probability of unity while inconsistent cycles have a probability of zero. The authors suggest that this mechanism could explain how physics sorts out consistent cycles, as only those with a net non-zero amplitude have a non-zero probability of occurring. They also discuss the connection between this principle and classical physics, citing examples such as the principle of least action. Overall, the paper proposes that the principle of self-consistency could have a solid physical basis in quantum mechanics. The authors acknowledge the contributions of S. Barnett, J. Jeffers, O. Jedrkiewicz, and R. Loudon, and the work was supported by a grant from the Australian Research Council. They also cite several relevant papers for further reading.

 This text discusses the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution function (pvdf) of galaxies in the context of the cold dark matter (CDM) model. The authors find that the predicted velocity dispersions from the CDM models are significantly smaller than observed, particularly for low-mass halos. They revisit this issue by combining the biasing effect with their analytical model of the pvd using the XMM-LSS simulations.  The authors adopt a biasing model where the selection function of galaxies in a halo is proportional to 1.5 times the mass function, as suggested by Jing et al. (2002). This biasing model puts lower weight on massive clusters, which suppresses the mean velocity dispersion. The Las Campanas Redshift Survey data are consistent with this prescription, while the PSCz data prefer a larger value.  Additionally, the authors consider another biasing effect to account for the observed density-morphology relation of galaxies. Spiral galaxies avoid the central regions of massive clusters, leading to a suppression of their velocity dispersions, especially in the case of modified NFW profiles with stronger central concentrations. The authors attempt to incorporate this effect by introducing a selection probability that depends on the distance from the center of the halo.  The results show that both the CLW bias effect and the density-morphology relation significantly suppress the velocity dispersions, in agreement with simulation results. However, even with the density-morphology relation, the predicted pvd for the IRAS PSCz galaxies is still too small to be reconciled with current models.  The authors have presented a detailed prediction for the pvdf of dark matter particles using the dark matter halo approach. They derive the pvdf in a self-consistent manner with the assumed density profile for the first time. However, they neglect the halo-halo contribution and their predictions are quantitatively valid only on small scales.  The authors also apply an empirical biasing scheme to their model and attempt to predict the pvd of galaxies. They reproduce previous simulation results using their analytical method and confirm that the very small pvd estimated for the PSCz galaxies is difficult to reconcile with a simplistic biasing model and/or the underlying CDM model. The discrepancy between the prediction and observation indicates the presence of velocity bias, in addition to other selection effects.  The authors suggest that the next step is to incorporate the effect of velocity bias into their scheme to account for the pvd of galaxies. They note that each luminous galaxy is a clump composed of baryon and dark matter particles, whose bulk motion might not trace the random motion of individual dark matter particles. Galaxy-galaxy interactions through tidal fields or gas pressure of baryons might be an important source for velocity bias.

 This text appears to be discussing the behavior of a specific solution in the context of the Friedmann equations in General Relativity, with an emphasis on the role of electromagnetic stress-energy tensors. The authors explore two possible interpretations for the anisotropic pressure: superimposing the stress-energy tensors of two pressureless fluids moving in opposite directions along a specific axis, or considering cosmic strings aligned with the Clifford parallels expanding and contracting with space while preserving the structure of the Hopf fibration.  The authors note that the metric in this model is similar to that of the closed FLRW universe, leading to a system analogous to the Friedmann equations with additional terms from electromagnetic stress-energy tensors. They proceed to analyze the first and second equations from the system using integration constants and potential energy concepts.  The text also mentions that the matter in this model satisfies the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions under certain circumstances. However, as the particles approach the speed of light near the big bang or the big crunch, the pressure always tends to zero, indicating that the matter particles are moving at the speed of light in the limit case.  The behavior of the scale factor is derived using an effective potential formulation, with each term thought of as a kinetic part, an effective potential, and a conserved energy, respectively. The authors note that a positive cosmological constant is required to have an unstable equilibrium point, allowing for reproducing previous results concerning the Einstein universe.  The text also mentions that except in the case of the Einstein universe and its two asymptotes, the electromagnetic field performs a finite number of oscillations during the history of the universe, proportional to its lifetime as measured in conformal time. This means that at any given epoch, these fields will appear mostly constant and may serve as models of primordial magnetic fields.  The text cites several sources for further reading, including works by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, R. Wald, Hawking and Ellis, Raada, and Thorne.

 This text appears to be discussing the properties of solutions in a theory called Bigravity, specifically focusing on the Isambert-Storey exact solution. The authors find that this solution cannot represent a black hole but rather the exterior solution to a spherical star. They also identify phase transitions for certain critical values of temperature, which depend on the coupling and potential parameters.  The text mentions several figures, which are not included in the provided text. These figures likely show plots of various quantities such as temperature and free energy versus different parameters. The authors vary these parameters within specific ranges and observe how the number of available states changes, leading to phase transitions in some cases. They also discuss the implications of stability and unitarity for their analysis.  The authors argue that the Isambert-Storey exact solution is not a generic property of Bigravity but rather a consequence of the chosen potential. For more generic potentials, they find additional integration constants in the solutions, which may be fine-tuned to produce a regular horizon. The text concludes by mentioning the support for their work from various research grants and acknowledging useful tips from P. Arriagada.

 This text appears to be a scientific research paper about the properties of High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs), specifically focusing on three individual HMXB systems and their clumpy wind models. The authors found that for certain ranges of clump masses, the drag force contributions are less than 3% of the forces from radiative acceleration due to electron scattering and gravity. Therefore, they neglected this contribution when determining the minimum clump radius.  The upper limit for the clump radius is obtained using the definition of a clump as an over-density with respect to the inter-clump smooth wind. The lower and upper limits for the clump radius depend on various supergiant parameters, leading to different minimum and maximum values for the initial radius distribution for supergiants of different spectral types. However, these differences are smaller than a factor of 10 for O and B supergiants.  The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion theory is applied to HMXBs where an OB supergiant loses mass in the form of a fast stellar wind that is assumed to be homogeneous and spherically symmetric. Only matter within a distance smaller than the accretion radius is accreted. The fraction of stellar wind gravitationally captured by the neutron star depends on the density of the wind.  The authors have summarized the wind parameters obtained for three HMXB sources in Table [summary hmxbs]. They found differences in mass-loss rates and terminal velocities expected from the CAK theory, similar values for some parameters, and different values for others which seem to be proportional to the inverse of the effective temperature of the supergiant. Additionally, they suggest that the observed light curves of the three HMXBs cannot be reproduced with the same set of wind parameters.  The authors propose that the discrepancy in the properties of the clumps for the three HMXB systems could be due to the different spectral types of the supergiants, which may result in varying wind properties. They also suggest that further observations and theoretical modeling are needed to better understand these systems.  References: - Bondi, H., Hoyle, F., & Lyttleton, R. (1939).

 This text discusses the rotational amplitudes and spatial distributions of primordial and enriched stars in globular clusters (GCs). The authors suggest that the initially larger rotational amplitude for polluted stars compared to primordial stars is due to angular momentum conservation, but this trend can reverse depending on the scenario of star formation. They also discuss the findings of Larsen et al. (2015) in M15, where they found that giants with primordial composition are more centrally concentrated than their enriched counterparts. The authors suggest that a larger binary fraction for primordial stars could explain this observation, but it remains to be shown in detail. They also propose future avenues to make progress in understanding the formation of multiple populations in GCs through their long-term kinematics and dynamics, including constraining any differential rotation of subpopulations, quantifying their central spatial distributions in a larger sample of GCs, and measuring the respective binary fractions of subpopulations in the central regions of clusters.

The text discusses the rotational amplitudes and spatial distributions of primordial and enriched stars in globular clusters (GCs). The authors suggest that the initially larger rotational amplitude for polluted stars compared to primordial stars is due to angular momentum conservation, but this trend can reverse depending on the scenario of star formation. They propose that removing a large fraction of first-generation stars from a GC would result in a decrease in its overall angular momentum, while the addition of polluted stars with higher angular momenta could increase it. Conversely, if polluted stars are the ones initially crossing the core of the cluster and preferentially on radial orbits, they may transfer angular momentum to the more centrally located primordial stars, leading to a net decrease in the rotational amplitude of the polluted stars.  The authors also discuss the findings of Larsen et al. (2015) in M15, where they found that giants with primordial composition are more centrally concentrated than their enriched counterparts. The authors suggest that this observation could be explained by a larger binary fraction for primordial stars, as binaries with low-mass companions can be more easily captured and retained in the dense central regions of GCs compared to high-mass companions or single stars.  The authors propose several future avenues to make progress in understanding the formation of multiple populations in GCs, including constraining any differential rotation of subpopulations through precise astrometry, quantifying their central spatial distributions in a larger sample of GCs using deep imaging and spectroscopy, and measuring the respective binary fractions of subpopulations in the central regions of clusters using radial velocity measurements and proper motion analysis.  In summary, the text discusses the rotational amplitudes and spatial distributions of primordial and enriched stars in globular clusters (GCs) and suggests that angular momentum conservation and binary fraction may play important roles in shaping their observed properties. The authors propose several future research directions to better understand the formation and evolution of multiple populations in GCs, including precise astrometry, deep imaging and spectroscopy, and radial velocity measurements and proper motion analysis.

 This text appears to discuss the behavior of neutrinos in the context of galaxy clusters and their potential role as dark matter. The authors explain that immediately after neutrino decoupling, when they were extremely relativistic, the fermi level and number density were given by certain equations. They then transition from the relativistic to nonrelativistic regime below a certain temperature or redshift. The authors suggest that modeling multiple cluster profiles with varying central densities may further constrain particle properties and improve the phenomenological equation of state.  They also discuss the potential effect of degenerate relic neutrinos on "free streaming," which is the suppression or preservation of initial fluctuations in the primordial neutrino density fluctuation spectrum. The authors plan to investigate this quantitatively in the future.  The text lists several particle types, their masses, and profiles for majorana (p), dirac (p), and dirac (p+@xmath162) particles with different spins and charges. The acceptable mass ranges for fermionic dark matter and neutrino-cdm mixtures are given in the case of previously unknown fermions dominating the dark matter or a mixture of degenerate relic neutrinos and classical collisionless cold dark matter particles, respectively. Both types of models reproduce the observations equally well.

 This text is an abstract from a scientific research paper about magnetic fields and differential rotation in cool, rapidly rotating stars. The authors report the detection of surface differential rotation using stellar surface features as tracers, and discuss the implications for the angular velocity field within the convective zone. They also estimate the power required to drive these changes and suggest that they may result from dynamo processes. The authors propose two models of the angular velocity field within the convective zone and explore their quantitative implications. They argue that the rotation velocity field within the convective zone is likely not like that of the sun, but rather resembles that expected for rapid rotators. The authors suggest that renewing the observations and using new instruments such as ESPADONS will provide more information on the internal rotation profile than other existing techniques like asteroseismology. They also express gratitude to collaborators and the referee for their contributions.

 This text discusses the fragile property of the Burgers equation, a model used to describe fluid dynamics with shock waves. The argument is that there is a symmetry in the Burgers equation, allowing us to convert the inviscid Burgers equation into its familiar form by reversing the signs of certain variables. This results in a single shock splitting into two, indicating maximal non-uniqueness of solutions.  The text also introduces the idea of negative temperature in turbulence, which is different from the usual thermodynamic temperature. It suggests that there are two temperatures in the system: a "superhot" negative temperature describing the ensemble of microscopic entities making up the turbulent state and a usual temperature describing the ensemble at the molecular level. These two ensembles interact weakly but must exchange energy due to the second law of thermodynamics.  The text proposes that fragile processes, which would result in nonuniqueness, occur in the energy range at small scales. These processes extract mechanical energy from the negative temperature "bath" and ultimately derive from the forces maintaining the turbulence. The onset of these processes would appear as an increase in resistance to external forces on the macroscopic scale and the proliferation of microscopic entities on a still more microscopic level.  The text also mentions that this picture is reminiscent of the Kolmogorov cascade idea and suggests identifying the turbulent ensemble with the energy range and the molecular ensemble with the dissipation range, assigning a temperature gradient to the Kolmogorov picture. The abstract picture proposed here might persist in a more realistic dynamics, and the issue of nonuniqueness may also be relevant to CFD modeling of turbulence.

 This text appears to be a scientific research paper discussing the analysis of data from high energy particle detectors, specifically the Hires-I monocular detector and other related experiments. The authors are reporting their findings on the absence of clustering in the highest energy events and the intrinsic sensitivity of the data to global autocorrelation. They also compare their results with those of other experiments and conclude that no more than 13% of the observed events could be sharing common arrival directions, assuming a certain energy scale difference between experiments. The paper acknowledges contributions from various funding agencies, institutions, and individuals, as well as previous related work by other researchers.

 This text appears to discuss various aspects of interstellar gas and star formation. It mentions the formation of HII regions, which are areas where hydrogen atoms have been ionized by the radiation from nearby stars. These regions have a radial density gradient reflecting the initial neutral cloud gradient, but also have an extended component of diffuse ionized gas surrounding them. The fraction of this ionization outside the conventional Stromgren sphere can be large.  The text also discusses different models for the structure of interstellar clouds, including hierarchical and fractal brownian motion models. Hierarchical clouds have all small clumps inside larger clumps, while fractal brownian motion clouds have small structure with equal probability everywhere, although it is weaker outside the larger clumps. The text suggests that in practice, only the dense hierarchical core will be observed, as low density regions outside of the main hierarchy may be ionized or invisible in CO.  The text also mentions observations of cluster mass functions and their similarity to expectations from hierarchical clouds. It discusses work by various authors on different aspects of interstellar gas and star formation, including Elmegreen & Falgarone (1997), Stutzki et al. (1998), Langer et al. (1997), Reynolds (1995), and Scalo (1990). The text also mentions the detection of the cumulene carbon chain molecule H2C6 in TMC-1 by Langer et al. (1997) and observations of warm neutral halos around molecular clouds by Wannier et al. (1993).

 This text describes the supersymmetry transformations and central charge transformations for the vector-tensor multiplet in superfield formalism. The authors show that these transformations realize the supersymmetry algebra with central charge. They also discuss how to write a superfield action for the vector-tensor multiplet and establish its connection to six-dimensional supersymmetry.  The text begins by discussing the supersymmetry transformations and central charge transformations of the vector-tensor multiplet, which are given by equation (1) in the text. The authors note that only the lowest order terms in @xmath106 depend on the independent components of these fields. They then proceed to derive the central charge transformations by acting with @xmath125 on @xmath97.  Next, they discuss how to write a superfield action for the vector-tensor multiplet and provide an expression for it in equation (6). This represents a central charge generalization of the type of superactions considered in [cite].  The authors then connect the superspace formulation of the vector-tensor multiplet to six-dimensional supersymmetry. They show that the presence of central charge leads to the augmentation of @xmath0 superspace by two new bosonic coordinates, @xmath21 and @xmath96. The resulting space is none other than the superspace of @xmath1 supersymmetry in six dimensions.  Finally, they mention some related issues that can be addressed using the superspace formalism, such as duality, finding an unconstrained @xmath0 prepotential for the vector-tensor multiplet, and describing other exotic supermultiplets like tensor and double-tensor multiplets. They leave the discussion of these issues to future publications.  The work was supported in part by DOE grant no. DE-FG02-95ER40893 and Nato grant no. CRG-940784.

 This text describes the new features and capabilities of a statistical toolkit in an analysis environment, specifically focusing on the new user layer that allows input data to be supplied as comma-separated values (CSV files) and the addition of tests for randomness and categorical data. The statistical toolkit comes with extensive unit tests and includes implementations of various statistical tests such as the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-square contingency table test.  The text also discusses the importance of testing for randomness in addition to goodness-of-fit tests, which can help detect systematic effects that may not be apparent with goodness-of-fit tests alone. The new version of the statistical toolkit includes implementations of runs tests for one or two samples and an approximated formula for calculating p-values.  The text also discusses the importance of categorical data analysis, which involves testing the significance of associations between groups. Fisher's exact test is mentioned as a widely used exact test for categorical data analysis, but it becomes computationally intensive for larger tables. The new development version of the statistical toolkit includes an algorithm to calculate the chi-square test with Yates continuity correction and an implementation of Fisher's exact test for 2x2 contingency tables.  The text concludes by mentioning that the new development cycle of the statistical toolkit comes with a more versatile build system and significant extensions in testing capabilities, making it a powerful data analysis tool for experimental physics problems concerned with data comparisons. The paper is dedicated to the memory of Paolo Viarengo, who contributed to the previous development cycles of the statistical toolkit.

 This text appears to be discussing the performance of two algorithms, Proportional Allocation (PA) and Greedy, in managing buffer lengths for data transmission in communication networks with renewable energy constraints. The authors of the study simulated these algorithms under different mean data arrival rates and analyzed their average buffer length performances.  The PA algorithm's average buffer length increases linearly with the increase in mean data arrival rate since it is irrelevant to the mean data arrival rate, and the produced power allocation remains constant. In contrast, the Greedy algorithm's increase in average buffer length is slow initially when the rate constraint is active for small values of mean data arrival rate. However, as the mean data arrival rate increases, more renewable energy becomes available, and the power allocation approaches the greedy allocation, resulting in a smaller gap between the two algorithms' average buffer lengths in the small value region. In the large value region, the gap remains constant.  The authors also mention that they studied delay-optimal data transmission of cognitive radio networks with renewable energy and proposed two practical algorithms: the online Greedy algorithm and the offline PA algorithm. The two algorithms are optimal under certain conditions, and the Greedy algorithm gives an upper bound on the average data buffer length while the PA algorithm derives a lower bound. They also discussed the case where SU cannot get PU's private information.  The text includes references to several related studies in the field of renewable energy-assisted communication networks, including works by Zhang et al., Yates and Doost, He et al., Huang et al., Usman and Koo, and Kulkarni and Banerjee.

 This text discusses the coherent backscattering effect in a system of two trapped atoms interacting with a probe beam at resonance. At zero temperature, inelastic scattering provides which-path information through the recoil effect. However, at finite temperature, the atomic movement destroys the interference once the average Doppler shift becomes of the order of the resonance width. Which-path information resides in the atomic velocities via resonance conditions, but the duality inequality no longer saturates due to an initial thermal state corresponding to a non-optimal detector preparation. The text also acknowledges collaborators and funding support.  Keywords: Coherent backscattering, trapped atoms, quantum duality, which-path information, finite temperature.

 This text describes the design and functionality of a high-voltage barrel pixel detector used in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The detector is made up of an n-type bulk material with implanted pixels, which are reversely biased to form pn junctions. The inter-pixel isolation is achieved using a modified p-spray technique. The choice of this design includes the ability to operate in partially depleted mode and the radiation hardness of the detector.  The detector readout chip, developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), is designed to handle high data rates and is radiation hard. The control and readout system of the detector is described, including the 0.25 micron token bit manager chip and the 11-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) used for pixel data acquisition.  The text also includes performance studies of the detector, such as detection efficiency and resolution measurements using pion beam test data and simulations. The agreement between data and simulation is excellent for high trigger rates, but there are discrepancies for low trigger rates due to radiation damage of the sensor under test.  The text provides references to relevant publications and thesis work related to the design and development of the CMS pixel detector.

 This text describes a study on the quantum spin glass transition (QSGT) in a disconnected random graph using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method. The researchers found that the QSGT exhibits long-range temporal correlations that develop at a higher value of @xmath23 (time) than purely spatial ones. They also noted that the system behaves similarly to a one-dimensional chain in a restricted sense due to the disorder, which may lead to the selection of an effective 1-D path of strong bonds.  The main findings of the study include:  1. The extension of DMRG to make it suitable for studying the QSGT on random graphs using path selection and wavefunction annealing. 2. The application of this modified DMRG algorithm to measure various quantities, such as energy gap, spin-glass susceptibility, entanglement entropy, long-distance spatial correlations, and average magnetization, with high precision for a few samples of different sizes. 3. The discovery that the maximum value of entanglement entropy @xmath70 occurs at the same value of @xmath27 (time) where the spin-glass susceptibility diverges. 4. The observation that the energy gap vanishes in the surroundings of this value for all realizations, and that long-range temporal correlations may develop at a higher value of @xmath23 than purely spatial ones. 5. The suggestion that the definition of entanglement entropy used in this study is an alternative approach to the standard block entropy. 6. The finding that as @xmath23 is reduced below @xmath29, the ground state probabilities of several classical low-energy configurations increase exponentially and then fall to zero, leaving only the classical minimum energy configuration as the ground state component. 7. The observation that the system behaves similarly to a 1-D chain in a restricted sense due to the disorder, which may lead to the selection of an effective 1-D path of strong bonds. 8. The challenge of understanding quantitatively how the entanglement entropy at the transition behaves as a function of the system size for both random and non-random couplings in future studies.  The text also mentions that the values of @xmath29 (critical point) obtained from this study are much higher than those predicted by duality arguments and RG analysis in one-dimensional systems, suggesting that the higher connectivity makes a large difference in this respect.

 This text appears to be a research talk abstract in the field of nuclear physics, specifically discussing recent developments in Effective Field Theory (EFT) and its application to understanding the proton spin problem. The speaker suggests that these advancements are made possible through a potential duality between Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) variables and macroscopic, color-flavor locked variables, which they refer to as the "Cheshire Cat Principle."  The abstract mentions several key references, including works by Kaplan, Alford, Rajagopal, Wilczek, Schiffer, and Carter. These papers explore various aspects of EFT, chiral symmetry, and color-flavor locking in the context of nuclear physics. The speaker also cites their own work on the proton spin in the Chiral Bag Model, which discusses Casimir contributions and the Cheshire Cat Principle.  Overall, this abstract suggests that recent advancements in EFT have led to a better understanding of the proton spin problem through the application of duality principles between QCD and macroscopic variables. The speaker emphasizes the importance of these findings for nuclear physics research and highlights several key references for further study.

 This text describes a study using the AIA instrument on SDO to observe supra-arcade downflows in solar flares. The authors extract narrow slits from each image and stack them horizontally as a function of time to create height-time maps. They use interpolation to extract intensities at arbitrary angles. The downflows are identified as dark tracks in the height-time maps, indicating that they have lower intensities than the surrounding emission.  To characterize the kinematics of the downflows, the authors fit selected height-time tracks to a function of the form h(t) = h0 + v0t + 1/2at^2, where h is the height, t is time, h0 is the initial height, v0 is the velocity, a is the acceleration, and h0 and v0 are assumed to be positive for upflows and negative for downflows.  The authors find that the median initial height of the downflows is approximately 111 mm, which is larger than in previous observations. The initial velocities and accelerations are similar to those presented in earlier studies. They also find that small initial velocities relative to the Alfvén speed are not an artifact of the lower heights at which downflows have been observed previously.  The authors note several challenges in interpreting these observations as evidence for magnetic reconnection, including the low velocities of the outflows and the formation of the initial flare plasma. They suggest that three-dimensional modeling may be required to fully understand the dynamics of the downflows. The authors also mention recent work suggesting that density depletions can form in reconnecting flux tubes moving through a nonuniform current sheet, but note that this model does not include chromospheric evaporation and it is unclear how long such depletions would persist.  The text concludes by noting the importance of high-resolution observations of the photospheric magnetic field in active regions for understanding the complexities of flare plasma.

 It appears that this text describes a calculation of quasinormal modes for gravitational waves emitted by a particle orbiting around a massive object, such as a black hole or a star. The text mentions that there is a difficulty with the integration over proper time at the turning point due to a singularity in the transformation of coordinates. To avoid this issue, they propose using a time coordinate in the integration instead.  The text also mentions the use of spherical harmonics and associated Legendre functions in the calculation. The source term for the gravitational wave emission is given by equation (13) in the text, which involves integrating over time using equations (20) and (21). However, the term involving the amplitude result, eq. (69), vanishes at the turning point, leading to a divergence in the integration. To resolve this issue, they propose expanding the functions near the turning point and evaluating the integral without difficulty.  The text also mentions that they use the continued fraction expansion method to calculate the quasinormal modes for a uniform density star with spherical symmetry. They compare their results with those of other authors who used different methods.

 This text appears to be a summary or abstract of a scientific research paper about the dynamics of bird flocks during landing, focusing on the interplay between collective motion and decision making. The authors investigate how system size affects spatial coherence and temporal behavior, as well as the impact of interaction radius and fluctuations on the process. They find that larger interaction radii lead to more coherent decision making, while fluctuations result in birds making excursions before returning to the flock. The probability density functions of separation between centers of mass during landing show power-law decays with fat tails. The authors also propose a boundary condition relevant to models of flocking and suggest potential applications to other systems exhibiting abrupt behavioral changes.  Keywords: bird flocks, collective motion, decision making, system size, interaction radius, fluctuations, probability density functions, power-law decays, boundary conditions.

 This text appears to be a scientific research paper discussing the scaling of convective velocities in different systems, specifically in the context of asteroids and granular materials. The authors use experimental data from a vertically shaken glass beads bed to derive a power-law scaling for the representative convective velocity, which they suggest can be applied to estimate convective velocities under various vibrational conditions. However, they note that the applicability of this result to actual regolith migration is limited due to the lack of variation in gravitational acceleration and frictional properties in the experiment. The authors also mention ongoing investigations into the dynamics of regolith migration owing to granular convection, and express gratitude for discussions and funding support.  The text includes several references cited using the [bibtex] format, which are not directly visible in this text but can be accessed through the "pmid:" number or the DOI link provided. The authors also use various symbols and equations, some of which are defined within the text (e.g., @xmath105 for vibrational velocity) while others may require additional context to understand fully. Overall, the text appears to be a contribution to the field of planetary science or materials physics.

 This text describes a mathematical result concerning isospectral graphs, which are graphs with the same spectrum (set of eigenvalues) for their Laplacian matrices. The authors present a proof that the nodal domain counting sequences resolve isospectrality, meaning that different graphs with the same spectrum have distinct nodal domain counting sequences.  They begin by discussing two subgraphs, graph I and graph II, derived from the complete graph. Graph I consists of vertices b, c, d, e, f, and all bonds connecting them, while graph II consists of vertices a, b, c, d, and all bonds connecting them. The authors define these subgraphs using sets of coordinates and examine their eigenfunctions with specific boundary conditions.  The main result is stated in Theorem 3, which asserts that the degeneracy (multiplicity) of an eigenvalue in the Laplacian spectrum of graph I is equal to its degeneracy in the Laplacian spectrum of graph II. The authors prove this theorem by constructing a transplantation matrix for vertex wave functions between the two graphs and showing that it preserves degeneracies.  The text includes equations, figures, and references to previous work in the field. It assumes a strong background in linear algebra, graph theory, and spectral graph theory.

 This text appears to be discussing recent studies and findings in heavy ion physics, specifically those related to quenching effects in Au+Au collisions and the search for the critical point in the QCD phase diagram using the STAR experiment at RHIC.  The authors report preliminary results from a study on possible modifications of fragmentation functions due to quenching effects in Au+Au with respect to p+p reference measurements. No significant modification beyond 10-20% was observed within the uncertainties using current jet finding algorithms and background subtraction procedures. However, this conclusion depends heavily on assumptions of Pythia fragmentation and could be affected by bias induced in the jet sample by applying background suppressing analysis cuts.  The authors also discuss the importance of continuing research to explore the QCD phase diagram further, specifically focusing on the search for the critical point where the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase transition changes from a smooth crossover to a first order transition. They mention that theoretical predictions regarding the exact location of this critical point vary considerably due to approximations used in calculations and variations in lattice spacing, quark masses, and flavors.  The STAR experiment is expected to engage in a beam energy scan program to locate the critical point by varying incident energies to explore the QCD phase diagram and pinpoint the location of the critical point. The authors mention that Star has already demonstrated success in collecting data at low energies and are looking forward to new data in upcoming runs to further explore the QCD phase diagram.  The text also mentions recent results from ongoing correlation analyses from the STAR experiment, including studies on ridge properties from triggered and non-triggered correlation studies, which suggest that the bulk matter is the ridge origin due to large baryon to meson ratios and uniformity of ridge yield in @xmath15-@xmath15 space. The authors also mention potential for full jet reconstruction in heavy ion collisions to provide further constraints on energy loss in the QCD medium, but note that the current data sample is limited in statistics to fully exploit this technique.  The text includes several references to previous studies and publications in the field of heavy ion physics.

 Title: Study of Light Flavor and Strange Particle Production in pp Collisions at sqrt[s] = 13 TeV with ALICE  Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) resumed its physics program in June 2015 with proton-proton (pp) collisions at sqrt[s] = 13 TeV, the highest center-of-mass energy reached in the laboratory. Previous measurements by ALICE on identified particles in pp collisions at lower energies showed that models usually fail to describe pion, kaon, and proton yields. In this study, light flavor particles (p, K, π) and multi-strange baryons were identified using several particle identification techniques in the different ALICE sub-detectors: Inner Tracking System (ITS), Time Projection Chamber (TPC), Time of Flight Detector (TOF), and High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID). The hyperon-to-pion ratio as a function of collision energy was measured, revealing an enhancement in strange particle production at 13 TeV compared to lower energies. Pythia 8 was found to describe the shape but exhibit large deviations from data for transverse momenta larger than 2 GeV/c. The relative production of strange resonances remained constant within a wide range of center-of-mass energy. Multiplicity-dependent studies in pp collisions at 13 TeV will help disentangle the role of collision energy and event multiplicity in identified particle production. References: [List of references]

 This text describes a study of solar filament eruptions and their associated magnetic helicity. The authors found that in most cases, the helicity of the overlying arcade dominates over the helicity of the filament barbs, which are concave downward features as advocated by Martin (1998). This means that the direction of rotation of an erupting filament depends on which structure provides the main contribution to the net helicity.  The authors analyzed data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) database for Solar Cycle 23 and were able to determine the direction of rotation of an erupting filament in only a few events. They suggest that this may be due to the relatively low cadence of EIT observations, which all involved non-active region filaments, of which only two rotated in the "wrong" sense.  The authors also discuss recent models of active region fields and how they support the hypothesis that some filament eruptions are triggered by the emergence of flux near the filament channel. They provide an example of such an event from 1999 September 20, where the eruption was accompanied by a reconfiguration of both the underlying photospheric neutral line and the shape of the filament itself.  The text includes several technical terms related to solar physics, such as magnetic helicity, flux rope, potential configuration, and hollow solenoid. It also mentions various solar observations instruments, including EIT, MDI, Hα, and SOHO. The authors acknowledge the contributions of various collaborators and funding agencies.  The text includes two images, one taken on September 18 and the other on September 20, showing a southern hemisphere filament before and after its eruption. The left-bearing barbs of the filament are clearly seen in the pre-eruption image, while the re-formed structure hooks westward instead of eastward after the eruption. The locations of the brightenings at the endpoints of the erupted filament are circled in both images.

 This text is about the optical response and electronic properties of complexes formed between tetrakis(p-toluenesulfonate)methane (TPP) molecules and graphene or carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The authors find that there are resonances between the TPP transitions and the CNT bands, which can increase the emission of the corresponding complex. They also observe a charge transfer from TPP to graphene, revealing a p-type doping mechanism. The text includes figures showing the electronic band structure and density of states of the graphene-TPP compound and the absorption spectra of TPP on graphene and CNTs. The authors find strong binding interactions between TPP and both graphene and CNTs, with larger binding energies and adsorption distances for larger CNT diameters. They suggest that diameter is the relevant parameter for the strong TPP physisorption rather than chirality. The results indicate that both the graphene-TPP (G-TPP) and carbon nanotube-TPP (CNT-TPP) complexes exhibit remarkable stability while preserving the absorption properties of the chromophore, which may be of interest for light-harvesting and bio-labeling applications. The authors note that increasing TPP coverages may change their conclusions. They also mention that metallic and semimetallic CNTs exhibit similar optical response properties.

 This text describes a method for analyzing cellular signals from spatiotemporal data, specifically image data. The goal is to extract meaningful neuronal signals while removing background noise and false positives. The method involves several steps:  1. Background estimation and removal: Estimate the background using a low-rank approximation (B-spline basis) and remove it from the raw data. Adaptively change the basis and rank as needed to improve the approximation. 2. False positive neuron deletion: Identify and delete neurons that are false positives, i.e., do not represent meaningful cellular signals. These operations can lead to better extraction of cellular signals. 3. Merging inappropriately split neurons: Combine neurons that were inappropriately split into several components to improve the signal qualities of nearby neurons. 4. Manual intervention for low-quality neurons: Users can verify and delete low-quality neurons, which will be absorbed by the background or other neurons. 5. Adding new neurons: Extract new neurons from the residual data using a rank-1 non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in a small window centered at the maximum residual pixel. 6. Optimizing the model: After background removal, optimize the model by fitting it to the corrected data using the same cnmf problem as proposed in [xcite], but without the background term. 7. Fast implementation: The method is designed to be fast and can be easily optimized for large datasets. It uses parallel processing, GPU utilization, and distributed computing where possible. 8. Comparison with PCA-ICA method: The method allows manual intervention steps that can significantly improve the results compared to the PCA-ICA method, which has no such steps. 9. Convergence and performance: The method converges quickly and performs well on large datasets, as demonstrated in an example of a simulated dataset with 93 pixels and 3000 frames.
