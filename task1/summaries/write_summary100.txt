 The text appears to be discussing the results of an analysis of sunspot data, specifically looking for periodicities in sunspot area fluctuations during the maximum activity period of solar cycle 16. The authors used wavelet analysis and autocorrelation functions to investigate the existence of a periodicity around 155 days. They found that the dispersion of points related to this periodicity was large, making it difficult to confirm its existence. They also compared the autocorrelation functions and periodograms of sunspot area fluctuations from each solar hemisphere separately during the maximum activity period. The results suggested that there might be a statistically significant positive peak in the interval of 155-165 days for the southern hemisphere, but the resolution of the periodogram was not sufficient to make a definitive conclusion. The authors also noted that power spectrum analysis alone may not be sufficient to detect true periodicities and suggested using both correlative and power spectrum analyses together. Overall, the text indicates that further research is needed to confirm the existence and significance of the 155-day periodicity in sunspot data.

 This text appears to be a scientific research paper on the topic of nuclear physics, specifically focusing on the calculation of decay half-lives for alpha decays in atomic nuclei and the penetration of potential barriers. The authors have developed a new analytical formula based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to calculate the barrier penetrability, taking into account the influence of the long-range Coulomb tail in the barrier potential.  The text includes a comparison of the results obtained using different approaches, including the parabolic approximation and the WKB approach, for various isotopes of Po (polonium). The authors have assumed the barrier potential to be spherical for most cases, and they have shown that their new formula gives very good results for these spherical nuclei.  The text also discusses the importance of evaluating the integral in the equation for the penetrability and provides an analytical expression for it. The computation was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation, the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China, the Knowledge Innovation Project of CAS, and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Overall, the text presents a new analytical formula for calculating barrier penetrability in nuclear physics, which could be useful for studying barrier penetrability where one has to introduce an energy-dependent one-dimensional potential barrier or a barrier distribution function.

 This text discusses the comparison of various numerical integrators for computing molecular dynamics steps in the Schwinger model using the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. The authors consider a 122x122 lattice with coupling constant xmath123 and mass xmath124, taking parameters from [xcite] to simulate near the scaling limit with light fermions and increase the impact of the fermion part of the action. They use one thermalized gauge configuration and generate independent sets of momenta for each integrator and step size. The absolute error and statistical error are computed for each integrator and value of the step size. The micro step size is chosen to be 1/10 times smaller than the macro step size.  Figure [fig:1] compares the numerical integrators in terms of their absolute error versus the step size, showing that multi-rate schemes, RKF45 and RKF85, outperform their standard versions as expected. The adaptive nested force-gradient method has the best accuracy, while figure [fig:2] presents the CPU time required for each integrator versus the achieved accuracy. The nested force-gradient method and adapted nested force-gradient method show better computational efficiency than the other integrators.  Table [tab:1] shows the number of inversions of the Dirac operator needed to reach a 90% acceptance rate of the HMC algorithm, with @xmath121 being the most computationally demanding part. The adapted nested force-gradient method and nested force-gradient method require the least number of inversions per trajectory to reach the chosen acceptance rate.  The authors conclude that nested force-gradient schemes are an optimal choice for relatively high convergence order and low computational effort, and suggest further improvements by measuring Poisson brackets of the shadow Hamiltonian and tuning optimal parameters. In future work, they plan to apply this approach to the HMC algorithm for numerical integration in lattice QCD, expecting the adapted nested-force gradient scheme to outperform the original one with more partitioning of the action using techniques to factorize the fermion determinant.

 This paper discusses methods for deriving functional equations for Feynman integrals, specifically focusing on vacuum type integrals and integrals with external momenta. The authors introduce new methods that are simple and do not rely on integration by parts techniques. They also demonstrate that integrals with many kinematic arguments can be reduced to a combination of simpler integrals with fewer arguments.  The paper presents two methods for deriving functional equations: one based on recurrence relations, and the other using algebraic relations between products of propagators. The authors note that it is not yet clear whether functional equations derived from recurrence relations can be reproduced by the methods of algebraic relations between products of propagators.  The paper includes specific examples of functional equations for vacuum type integrals and integrals with external momenta, and discusses their implications for one-loop integrals with four, five, and six external legs, as well as some two- and three-loop Feynman integrals. The work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) within the collaborative research center 676 _ Particle, Strings and the Early Universe: The Structure of Matter and Space-Time_.

 This text appears to be discussing the use of the Hough transform in the search for gravitational waves, specifically in the context of periodic sources. The authors compare the efficiency and effectiveness of using a frequency Hough transform versus a sky Hough transform in terms of amplitude loss and computing cost. They find that the ratio of amplitude efficiencies is 1.317, which leads to a gain in computing cost for the same sensitivity. They also note the importance of adaptivity in the procedure and its applicability to situations where the source position is known but only the frequency needs to be estimated. The authors are also working on studying the efficiency of this method in terms of rejecting spurious lines in the peakmap.  The text includes several references to previous works on the Hough transform search for gravitational waves, including papers by Sintes et al., Astone et al., and Palomba et al. These papers discuss various aspects of the Hough transform search, such as its implementation, sensitivity evaluation, and application to Virgo data. The text also mentions a paper on "incoherent strategies for the network detection of periodic gravitational waves" by Palomba and Frasca, which may be relevant to the current discussion as well.

 This text is a scientific review discussing the progress made in identifying the progenitors of certain types of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) using pre-explosion images. The author discusses five different types of CCSNe and provides an update on the current understanding of their progenitor stars based on observational data.  Type II-Plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are the best-studied category, with eight putative progenitor detections and 12 upper luminosity limits established. The evidence suggests that red supergiants (RSGs) are the immediate progenitors of SNe II-P. However, an intriguing result is that all but one of the detected SNe II-P have initial masses constrained to be below 30 solar masses, which is surprising since RSGs up to 32 solar masses are observed in the local group. This lack of massive RSG progenitors leads researchers to speculate that these massive RSG progenitors may be forming black holes heralded by faint or non-existent SN explosions.  Type II-Linear supernovae (SNe II-L) are a rare type, with only one known example (SN 1980k), and no pre-explosion images exist for most of them. The analysis of the stellar population of SN 1979c by @xcite determines a mass range of 34 solar masses for its progenitor, but firm conclusions about the progenitors cannot be made yet.  Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) have one known example (SN 2005gl) with a very massive progenitor that exploded while in the luminous blue variable (LBV) phase, but it is unclear if this is indicative of the class as a whole.  Type IIB supernovae have pre-explosion images for two events: SN 1993j in M81 and SN 2008ax. The analysis of SN 1993j suggests that a 35 solar mass star exploded in a binary system, with a slightly less massive secondary surviving the explosion. The recent discovery of pre-explosion HST/WFPC2 images for SN 2008ax provides an opportunity to further investigate this rare class of CCSNe.  Type Ib/c supernovae have ten upper limits but no detections from analysis of pre-SN images, which is surprising since it is commonly thought that at least some of their progenitors should be luminous, single W-R stars. However, it is unlikely that all SNe Ib/c come from them based on current data.  The author concludes by discussing the future directions of research in this field and the exciting prospects for discoveries at the extremes of mass ranges, as well as the role of binarity in these conclusions. The review provides a comprehensive update on the current state of research on CCSN progenitor identification using pre-explosion images.

 This text appears to be a proof of a theorem in statistics, specifically about the Kingman coalescent in the context of the exchangeable coalescent process. The proof uses the rate function and the large deviation principle. The theorem states that the number of particles in the exchangeable coalescent process converges almost surely to a certain random variable as the number of particles goes to infinity. The text also mentions Lemma [l : wn] which is used in the proof but its statement is not provided.  The proof starts by defining some notation and setting up the problem. It then uses the fact that the minimum of a function is attained at its global minimum to prove a certain assertion. The rate function is shown to be of a specific form using integration by parts and the distribution function of the one-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution.  The text then shows that the expected value of a certain term is positive, which is necessary for the proof. This is done by analyzing the behavior of the term as t goes to infinity and using the fact that the probability of an event related to a random variable is non-negative.  Finally, the theorem is proven using Lemma [l : wn] and the strong law of large numbers. The text concludes by acknowledging the contributions of other researchers and the funding sources for the research.

 This text describes the study of multi-component solitary waves in quasiperiodic quasi-phase matching (QPM) gratings using numerical simulations. The grating function varies according to the Fibonacci sequence, and its Fourier spectrum is composed of sums and differences of the basic wavenumbers, which fill the whole Fourier space densely due to their incommensurability.  The authors analyze the propagation and second harmonic generation (SHG) in the quasiperiodic QPM grating by going beyond the averaged equations to consider the rapid large-amplitude variations of the envelope functions. They find that for weak input beams, both beams eventually diffract, but when the amplitude of the input beam exceeds a certain threshold, self-focusing and localization are observed for both harmonics. The resulting two-component soliton is quasiperiodic by itself and oscillates in phase with the QPM grating modulation.  The authors also investigate the transition between the linear (diffraction) and nonlinear (self-trapping) regimes by simulating the transmission coefficients and beam widths at the output of the crystal versus the intensity of the fundamental harmonic input beam for various phase mismatch values. They find that a quasiperiodic soliton is generated only for sufficiently high amplitudes, illustrating the universality of localized mode generation for varying strength of nonlinearity in quasiperiodic waves.  The text also mentions several other examples of multi-component solitary waves in nonlinear optical fibers and waveguides, including multi-wavelength solitary waves in multi-channel bit-parallel wavelength fiber transmission systems, multi-color parametric spatial solitary waves due to multistep cascading in quadratic materials, and quasiperiodic envelope solitons in Fibonacci optical superlattices. These examples reveal some general features and properties of multi-component solitary waves in nonintegrable nonlinear models and serve as a stepping stone for approaching other problems of multi-mode soliton coupling and interaction.  The work was supported by the Australian Photonics Cooperative Research Centre and a collaborative Australia-Denmark grant of the Department of Industry, Science, and Tourism (Australia).

 This text describes a study on the joint von Neumann entropy of two subsystems, atoms a and b, and a mode with photon number in a four-particle composite system. The authors calculate the joint entropy by tracing over the other subsystems using the reduced density matrix of atoms a and b. They show that the entropy never becomes negative during the evolution, indicating that the subadditivity inequality holds for all times. In the long time limit, the subsystems become disentangled, as shown in Figure 2, due to complete adiabatic transfer of population to the level of both atoms. The authors also discuss the time variation of the coefficients and present figures showing the evolution according to the state under the action of pulses. For one of the cases, since complete population transfer does not occur, the system remains entangled in the state at long time limits. They recognize the expression for four-particle entanglement as a measure of entanglement in the present process and show that it satisfies all relevant criteria. Using this entanglement measurement, they study the inequality involving the entropies of two particles, atoms a and b, and note that they remain strongly correlated during the evolution but become uncorrelated at the end of the evolution. They also discuss a counter-example where the equality in the Lieb inequality holds for an entangled state. The authors conclude by showing the role of strong subadditivity inequality for entropies in a four-particle composite system and providing references to related work.

 This text appears to be a scientific research article discussing the pulsational instability and seismic properties of subgiant stars, specifically focusing on HD 163899. The authors find that lower metallicity in the main sequence and shell hydrogen burning models decreases pulsational instability, while in blue loop models, effective temperature plays a more significant role. They identify unstable modes in blue loop models with metallicities as low as 0.01 Zsun.  The authors also note differences in the behavior of the instability parameter between models before and after core helium ignition. In shell hydrogen burning models, only partial reflection of pulsation modes at the acoustic depth is sufficient to drive the mode, whereas on the blue loop, the mode must be almost entirely reflected for instability. Based on this analysis, they conclude that subgiant stars should undergo shell hydrogen burning instead of core helium burning on the blue loop.  The authors suggest that multi-color photometry for HD 163899 would be desirable to aid in mode identification and understanding pulsations of subgiant stars. They also acknowledge the need for a better determination of the star's basic parameters and constructing a seismic model taking into account rotation effects.  The research was financially supported by Polish NCN grants, and references various works by other authors, including Asplund et al., Daszyska-Daszkiewicz et al., Diembowski, Godart et al., Herwig, Iglesias et al., Jager et al., Klare and Neckel, Lanz and Hubeny, Le Breton et al., Van Loon et al., Cioni et al., Nieuwenhuijzen and De Jager, Pamyatnykh et al., Paxton et al., Reimers, Saio et al., Schmidt and Carruthers, Seaton, Stellingwerf, Thoul et al., Unno et al., Vink and de Koter, and Lamers et al.

 This text discusses the results of a study on bright-dark solitons (BDs) and bubble-drops (BDS) in a binary system of two quantum gases, specifically a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and a quintessentially nonlinear Schrödinger gas (NLSE). The study investigates the existence of three types of interfaces: domain walls (DWS), BDS, and bright-dark solitons (BDSS).  The text reveals that analytical results were obtained using Thomas-Fermi approximations (TFA) combined with numerical analysis. The DWS have an explicit analytical form derived via TFA, while their generic form was found numerically. The study demonstrates that BDS exist only as a tg drop in a bec background, but BDS complexes can be built equally well using the tg bright and bec dark components or vice versa.  The findings suggest potential new experiments with tightly confined two-species mixtures of ultracold bosonic gases. The analysis can also be extended to study chains of BDS and/or DBSS in a long system, including circular ones that correspond to the binary gas loaded into a tight toroidal trap.  The authors acknowledge valuable discussions with M. Salerno and financial support from various Italian research programs.

 The Flight Management Infrastructure (FMI) is a product designed to minimize interference between aircraft and preplanned astronomical observations. It predicts ground tracks for executing its mission and corrects the plan based on actual conditions while in flight. FMI consists of both a planning component, which can run on the ground and in the air, and an execution component that runs in the air. The planning component manages a set of ordered observations and optional aircraft repositioning requests, while the execution component compares the plan to actual conditions and requests headings from the autopilot.  Sofia mission planning differs significantly from satellite or ground-based observatory planning due to the importance of observation target history and the need to consider entire flight series at once for greater target variety. Conventional aircraft fly from point to point along specified paths on the ground, but Sofia cannot observe in this manner due to unexpected winds. Fuel weight is a strong function of aircraft capabilities, making it essential to consider fuel rather than time when planning flights.  Sofia flight planning also faces external constraints such as special use airspace (SUA) incursions, national airspace boundaries, over-ocean operations, and gross takeoff weight limits. Additionally, science-driven constraints require interaction with scientists or detailed knowledge of the observations. Prior to any particular mission, several iterations of flight planning are performed, including fully integrated automated flight planning.  FMI requires substantial input data for accurate prediction of a flight track and its constraints, such as weather forecast time series and aircraft performance data. It interacts with airborne data acquisition software while in flight and observation planning software on the ground. To test FMI components and integrate other systems, a simulation environment is used, including a medium-fidelity aircraft simulator, an automated pilot simulator, a method to set the time arbitrarily, and a telescope simulator.  Sofia presents a unique flight planning problem due to the nature of astronomical observation, and FMI provides a connection between scientific needs and practical constraints without introducing excessive safety considerations or pilot workload or planner effort.

 This text describes a study on the dipole-dipole interaction effects on transition rates between different light and dark periods in two four-level systems: one modeled after hg@xmath0 and the other after ba@xmath0. The authors employed Bloch equations as well as a direct quantum jump approach to calculate the transition rates and obtained double jump rates from them.  For two d systems, they found that the dipole-dipole interaction effects were of similar magnitude as for two v systems, which was up to 30% for distances of the order of a wave length of the strong transition and about 5% around ten wave lengths, but practically absent for longer distances. They also recovered the special case where distances satisfying certain conditions were considered, and showed that the dipole coupling constant @xmath82's non-dependence on the interaction held to first order, with negligibly small second order terms.  However, for the effective model of two ba@x0 systems, their results yielded very small and hardly observable cooperative effects for the double jump rate, which was at odds with experimental results. Their method also applies to three ba@x0 ions but requires another paper. They concluded that the magnitude of cooperative effects due to the dipole-dipole interaction sensitively depends on how the meta-stable level is populated.  The text starts by explaining the procedure for a single @x122 system, which has just two types of periods: light and dark ones. The authors describe how the probability density for the next photon to occur at time @x126 and come from the @x123 transition is given by @x127, and then calculate the total transition probability, denoted by @x135. They also obtain expressions for @x80, @x119, and @x78 in a similar way. The transition rate @x118 can be directly read off from the no-photon probability @x138. The results are the same as in section [2dpert] when one expands in small parameters. In the case of @x92, they put @x139 and obtain expressions like @x140.

 This text appears to be a proof that after performing certain steps on a quiver with specific properties, there will only be two colors of arrows left. The proof is based on the assumption that initially, nine out of every hundred arrows are of color 0 or some other specified color.  The proof consists of several cases:  1. When neither vertex 13 nor vertex 69 coincides with vertex 70, and there are no arrows of the specified color between either vertex 13 or vertex 69 and vertex 70, then there will be no changes in the quiver. 2. When there is an equal number of arrows of the specified color between vertices 13 and 69 and between vertices 13 and 70 (or between vertices 69 and 70), then some steps will be performed on the quiver. 3. The proof also discusses a concept of quadrangulations, which are partitions of a polygon into quadrilaterals, and how these relate to the colored quiver.  The text includes several diagrams that illustrate the concepts discussed in the proof. It is not clear from the provided text alone whether the proof is complete or if any assumptions have been left unstated.

 This text appears to be discussing the calculation of certain quantities in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), specifically the contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon from diagrams with charged Higgs bosons and charginos. The authors separate these contributions into two parts, one coming from diagrams with internal charged Higgs bosons and the other from diagrams with internal charginos.  The functions $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_7$ are given by integrals over the Feynman parameters, and $v^{(t)}_{r, l}$ and $o^{r, l}_{ij}$ are the left-handed and right-handed couplings of the top quark to the charged Higgs boson and charginos, respectively. The masses $m_i$ and $\tilde{m}_k$ refer to the masses of various particles in the theory, including the top quark, charginos, and stop mass eigenvalues.  The text also mentions several papers that provide context for this calculation, including works by Fayet et al., Dimopoulos and Georgi, Witten, Ibaez and Ross, Kaul, Dine et al., and Dimopoulos and Raby. The authors also cite reviews by Nilles, Haber and Kane, Gunion and Haber, and Langacker.  The text concludes with a reference to a talk presented by J. Incandela at the 6th International Symposium on Heavy Flavor Physics in Pisa, Italy, in June 1995, as well as publications from CDF and Fermilab.

 This text describes the application of the Nikhilam Sutra, a method from Vedic mathematics, to binary number multiplication. The Nikhilam Sutra is used to convert large-digit multiplication into small-digit multiplication with fewer operations. In this example, the authors demonstrate how to multiply two 264-bit numbers using the Nikhilam method and compare it to standard multiplication and Karatsuba multiplication.  The text explains that the Nikhilam Sutra can be used to reduce the number of multiplications required for large binary multiplications. The authors provide an example of multiplying two 264-bit numbers using the Nikhilam method, which involves performing square operations and then using those results to compute the final multiplication. They compare this method to standard multiplication and Karatsuba multiplication in terms of the number of multiplications required.  The authors also mention that the Nikhilam Sutra can be used as a standalone multiplication algorithm or in conjunction with other fast algorithms like Karatsuba multiplication. They suggest optimizing the algorithm by truncating least significant bits from input numbers and processing consecutive digits to skip some steps. The proposed method is particularly efficient because it involves fewer multiplications compared to other methods.  The text concludes by suggesting future work on extending this method to large-digit multiplication and exploiting its properties to perform fast integer multiplications. Overall, the authors demonstrate that the Nikhilam Sutra can be a useful tool for binary number multiplication, especially when both multiplicand and multiplier are near to some base power.

 This text appears to be a research abstract in English, discussing the Abel distribution functions introduced by Dejonghe and Laurent (1991). The authors begin by explaining that these functions are able to model disc-like distributions with finite vertical extent and exponential decline in the galactic plane, while favoring nearly circular orbits. They also note that these functions can introduce anisotropy through the dependence on the third integral of motion.  The authors then go on to show that a van der Kruit disc can be modeled using a linear combination of these distribution functions with an explicit dependence on the third integral and realistic anisotropy in velocity dispersions. They suggest that these functions are promising tools for modeling real data, such as Hipparcos data, by using the quadratic programming algorithm described by Dejonghe (1989). This will provide information on the dynamical state of tracer stars in the Milky Way or external galaxies.  The text includes references to various other works and authors in the field of galactic astronomy and distribution functions, including Binney and Merrifield (1998), Dehnen and Gerhard (1993), and Kruit (1988).

 This text describes a study on the time evolution of a single-level quantum dot (QD) with Coulomb interaction and tunnel coupled to a reservoir, focusing on the relaxation rates for charge and spin, as well as an additional independent relaxation rate @xmath125. The study also investigates the effects of varying interaction strength @xmath6 and level position @xmath5 on the system.  The authors find that the presence of two particles in the dot leads to a relaxation process related to @xmath125, which is independent of the energy level of the dot and interaction strength. They propose the time evolution of the square deviations of the charge from its equilibrium value as a physical quantity related to this decay.  The authors analyze three different setups: a single-level QD tunnel coupled to a single reservoir, a dot proximized by a superconductor and coupled to a normal reservoir, and a dot coupled to a ferromagnetic lead. In the hybrid normal-superconducting systems, they find that the time-resolved readout of the charge represents another possibility to access the rate @xmath104.  The text includes calculations for the transition matrix in the eigenbasis of the isolated QD and discusses the right and left eigenvectors, which determine the stationary density matrix and deviations out of equilibrium, respectively. The authors also explain how operators for quantum dot observables can be expressed in vector representation for simplified calculation.  The study acknowledges financial support from various organizations and thanks Michael Moskalets, Roman Riwarp, and Maarten Wegewijs for fruitful discussions.

 This text describes an analysis of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) data using two detectors, Hires-I and Hires-II. The authors have binned the data and normalized the Monte Carlo (MC) histograms to have the same area as the data points. They then compare the ratios of the data to MC distributions in each bin.  After extracting the flux from the data, they fit the measured points to an astrophysical model for UHECR sources and propagation. The model assumes that extragalactic sources are distributed throughout the universe and evolve as a power law with a spectral slope parameter. Energy losses are taken into account using a formalism from Berezinsky et al. (2008).  The authors also include a galactic component in their model, assuming it consists of iron nuclei based on the Fly's Eye composition measurement. The spectral form is assumed to be a power law multiplied by a linear factor going from unity at a certain energy to zero at another energy.  They find that this model fits the data well due to its agreement with three features: the drastic reduction in flux above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy, the presence of the "second knee" and "ankle," which are results of electron pair production, and the fit's ability to explain both the electron pair-production features and the pion production feature (the GZK cutoff).  The authors also mention that Hires has recently announced preliminary measurements of the UHECR energy spectrum using each of its two detectors in monocular mode. They find that their two-component model, which includes an extragalactic component conforming to the expectation of a nearly uniform distribution of sources modified by the observed distribution of luminous matter and its evolution as a function of redshift, fits all recognized features of the UHECR spectrum.  The authors comment on the discrepancies between Hires and ASA, with ASA seeing no evidence for the GZK cutoff, and Hires being consistent with its presence. However, they note that below the GZK cutoff, the two experiments agree nicely in the shape of the spectrum, with only an offset in the flux, which can be attributed to a difference in energy scales within the stated systematic uncertainty of either experiment.  The authors acknowledge their colleagues in the Hires collaboration for realizing this work and express gratitude for their support from the US National Science Foundation grant PHY 0073057.

 A. Rylov's paper discusses the role of geometry in understanding the Dirac particle and the conceptual shift from geometric considerations to quantum theory in the twentieth century. The text includes comments on a referee report regarding his paper "Dynamical methods of investigation in application to the Dirac particle," which was submitted to a scientific journal.  In the paper, Rylov introduces the idea that the Dirac particle's properties can be described using a tubular geometry construction, which may lead to a new revision of the space-time conception. He argues that the geometric dynamics of the Dirac particle is not based on rotation but instead results in angular momentum and magnetic momentum as spatial evolution corollaries when the world chain is a helix. This leads to spin discreteness for the Dirac particle.  Rylov also discusses the limitations of using inadequate space-time geometries, such as Minkowski or Riemannian geometry, which may require the introduction of additional interactions to compensate for the false geometry. He emphasizes that a discrete geometry is associated with a grid and cannot be continuous but that a geometry given on a continuous set of points (manifold) can still be discrete.  The paper also touches upon the historical context of why microcosm physics left the successful program of physics geometrization for quantum theory, citing the discovery of electron diffraction as a reason for the need to consider multivariance in the microcosm physics. Rylov argues that multivariance can be taken into account on either the level of space-time geometry or dynamics and that this approach has the potential to describe both nonrelativistic and relativistic phenomena, as well as the theory of elementary particles.  In his author comments to the referee reports, Rylov addresses concerns raised by the referees regarding the clarity and completeness of the paper. He provides additional explanations and clarifications on various points in the text, ensuring that the paper is accessible to a broader audience.

 This text appears to be discussing the results of microlensing events, which are astronomical phenomena caused by the gravitational lensing effect of massive objects passing in front of a background star or quasar. In particular, it mentions several specific microlensing events and the interpretations placed on them by different research teams.  The first event mentioned is macho 1997-blg-41, which caused a stir in the community due to its unusual double caustic structure that could not be fit with static stellar binary models. Bennett et al. proposed a model of a static triple system with a Jovian planet orbiting the stellar binary, but this was later shown to be incompatible with the data by the planet team.  The second event mentioned is ogle 2000-bul-12, for which Yock et al. suggested the possibility of a planet orbiting the primary lens based on public domain OGLE data that displayed an anomaly at peak. However, unpublished planet team data showed no anomaly and much smaller scatter at the same temporal position.  The third event mentioned is macho 1998-blg-35, for which the MPS and MOA groups noticed a weak anomaly near the peak that they interpreted as evidence of a low-mass companion. However, this signal fell below the formal detection limit, and planet team data did not confirm the detection.  The text also discusses the current capabilities and limitations of microlensing for detecting planets, including the fact that it is most sensitive to planets at larger orbital radii than radial velocity techniques, but has more sensitivity to Neptune-mass planets than any other ground-based search technique. It also mentions challenges in detecting and characterizing Earth-mass planets with reasonable efficiency, such as the diluting effect of finite source size on the magnification gradient due to small caustics.  The text concludes by mentioning potential future enhancements to microlensing capabilities, including large-aperture spectroscopy of an event to identify the faint primary lens and measurement of photometric centroid motion to yield the mass of the lens and more robust determination of planetary parameters.

 This text describes an analysis of maser data in the context of the dynamics of the Milky Way galaxy. The authors find that the masers are moving towards the galactic center, as illustrated in Figures "dist" and "phases." However, they note that this information does not significantly improve our knowledge of the mass of the galaxy or its angular rotation speed at the Sun's radius.  The authors suggest that the distribution function of the masers may depend on the galactocentric radius, and that there is evidence for an unmodeled radial dependence in their results. They also note that the measurement of the potential of the galaxy using non-angle mixed tracers like masers has fundamental limitations due to the exchangeability of structure in the distribution function with complexity of the potential.  The authors use a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to explore the posterior probability distribution and find that the maser data themselves only weakly constrain the mass of the galaxy. They also show samples from the posterior distribution for mean motion towards the galactic center, in the direction of galactic rotation, towards the north galactic pole, and the square root of the trace of the velocity dispersion tensor.  Additionally, they discuss the dependence of apocenter radius and current radius on galactocentric radius in a spherically symmetric logarithmic potential for 50 kpc and 51 km s$^{-1}$. Filled symbols indicate that the maser is moving towards the galactic center.

 This text appears to be describing the results of an experiment measuring the total cross section for a particular reaction using three different experimental setups. The data is presented in several figures, with open circles representing previous results and filled circles representing the new measurements. The dashed curves in the figures represent Legendre fits using @xmath64 6.  The first figure shows the energy dependence of the total cross section binned into five intervals for the three experiments. The second figure displays the energy dependence of the total cross section as obtained with three independent measurements under different experimental conditions: quasifree collisions with an unpolarized beam and without a magnetic field in the central part of the WASA detector at three beam energies (open circles), quasifree collisions with an unpolarized beam but with a magnetic field in the central part of the WASA detector (open diamonds), and reversed quasifree collisions with a polarized beam and without a magnetic field in the central part of the WASA detector (filled circles). The data from the first and third measurements have been normalized to the value obtained in the second measurement for @xmath25 = 2.38 gev.  The authors conclude that the data from all three experiments agree within uncertainties, and they have presented the first measurements of the @xmath0 reaction with a polarized beam using the quasifree @xmath24 collision process under reversed kinematics. The deduced total cross sections are consistent with previous results, and the obtained deuteron angular distributions complement the previous results by showing that at resonance the anisotropy is larger than outside. The measurements also exhibit significant analyzing powers in dependence of deuteron and hyperon angles.  The text includes a large number of references to other experimental and theoretical works in the field.

 This text appears to be discussing the results of studies on the mass-luminosity relations and luminosity functions (LFs) of globular clusters and open clusters at different metallicities. The authors find that the densities of open clusters are lower than those of globular clusters by a factor of around 32 times, with the older globular clusters being approximately an order of magnitude older. They suggest that dynamical histories may play a role in producing changes mimicking a systematic dependence on metallicity, but that this is not the primary cause of the LF turn-overs.  The authors note that the slope of the mass-luminosity relation rapidly increases at masses below around 0.3 solar masses (m₀.1), independent of metallicity. This causes a given mass increment to cover a larger and larger absolute magnitude increment, leading to turn-overs in the LFs at these magnitudes. They also note that metallicity causes an offset in luminosity at a given mass but only slightly affects the slope of the mass-luminosity relation at a given mass.  The authors apply observed and theoretical mass-luminosity relations to their cluster LFs and find that they yield smooth mass functions, supporting the interpretation that the increase in slope of the mass-luminosity relation with metallicity is responsible for the systematic changes in LFs with metallicity. They conclude that a large range of initial conditions and environments produce essentially the same distribution by mass of low mass stars, implying an invariant initial mass function.  The authors also present new observations of the cluster luminosity functions of NGC 2420 and NGC 2477 at approximately solar metallicity, finding that they turn over or possibly stop altogether around m₀ = 9.0 and may flatten around m₀ = 9.5, respectively. They compare these results to the solar neighborhood field star LF and published HST globular cluster LFs and find a smooth relation between the location of the LF turn-overs and metallicity, which matches the expected trend for a model star of 0.27 solar masses. The authors interpret this as strong evidence in favor of an invariant initial mass function and a metallicity-dependent mass-luminosity relation.

 This text appears to be describing data from an imaging instrument, likely from a space telescope such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The data includes information about the pixel size, field of view (FOV), wavelength ranges, and resolutions for various sub-bands or channels. Additionally, there are mentions of dichroics, which are filters used to separate different wavelengths of light.  The first set of numbers likely represents the following:  * The first number is the wavelength in micrometers (μm) for the first channel's central wavelength. * The second number is the pixel size along the slice in arcseconds per pixel. * The third and fourth numbers are the FOVs in the x and y directions, respectively, in arcseconds. * The fifth number is the arcsec/pixel value. * The sixth and seventh numbers are the wavelength ranges for sub-bands a, b, and c in micrometers. * The eighth number is the resolution in microns.  The following lines describe the properties of dichroics 1a, 1b, and 1c, as well as their corresponding wavelength ranges. This pattern continues for dichroics 2a, 2b, and 2c, and then for dichroics 3a, 3b, and 3c.  The last part of the text mentions channels 1 through 4, with each channel having an associated central wavelength, pixel size along the slice, FOV, arcsec/pixel value, and resolution.  The figures mentioned in the text likely show comparisons between the measured data (m) and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the JWST pupil, as well as normalized peak profiles for the along-slice (bottom left) and across-slice (bottom right) directions. The x-axis is multiplied by two in the lower figures.

 This text discusses the development and challenges of using real space Jastrow factors for wave function stenciling in quantum chemistry. The authors have demonstrated that 4-body real space Jastrow factors, equipped with suitable jastrow basis functions, can effectively eliminate ionic terms between molecular fragments, restoring size consistency to the geminal power and improving the situation for restricted Slater determinants. However, they face challenges in achieving clean set operations for fragment-encompassing counting regions due to the smoothness of optimal switching functions and residual curvature between atoms.  The authors propose that future general-purpose Numerical Configuration Interaction (NCI) basis functions should meet three requirements: be finite in spatial extent, capable of clean set operations, and remain efficiently evaluable for a randomly chosen electron configuration. They have introduced new 4-body Jastrow basis functions with smoothed indicator functions to check whether electrons are within a given region, allowing for effective counting and suppression of unwanted ionic configurations. These counting functions have minimal curvature except at their boundaries, enabling strong stenciling.  The primary focus in the future development of these number counting Jastrow factors is to formulate them in a way that permits automatic demarcation of important regions for arbitrary molecules using the variational principle. The authors acknowledge funding from the US Department of Energy and performed calculations on the Berkeley Research Computing Savio cluster.

 This text appears to be a scientific paper or appendix about the optimization of observables in high energy physics experiments, specifically those related to studying anomalous couplings and CP violation. The authors discuss how they have determined that their set of observables, obtained from expanding the differential cross section about the actual values of the couplings, is unique up to linear reparametrizations in the sense that it leads to the minimum error on the extracted parameters in the limit of large energies. They also mention that this result holds for both the case where the actual values of the couplings are zero and for the product measured with fixed luminosity. The text includes references to other relevant works in the field.

 This text appears to be discussing the results of simulations and observations of the metallicity distribution of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). The authors find that their simulations do not agree well with the observed distributions, particularly at low metallicities where the observed distributions show an increase in the number of stars, while the simulations predict a large number of essentially metal-free stars. They suggest possible explanations for this discrepancy, including pre-enrichment of the gas or a difference in the present and primordial initial mass functions (IMFs). The authors also mention that observations may be biased against the detection of very metal-poor stars (vmpss).  The text includes references to several papers and reviews on this topic, including works by Battaglia et al. (2006), Grebel et al. (2004), Helmi (2006), Hernquist (1993), Koch et al.

 This text appears to be discussing the results of a study on the behavior of wave functions in non-Hermitian systems, specifically in relation to reflectionless absorption and self-sustained emission. The authors find that the symmetry is not a necessary condition for a full real spectrum in such systems, and that the balance between a finite non-Hermitian cluster and an infinite semi-infinite chain plays a role in this phenomenon. They also demonstrate that at the exceptional point of these systems, the eigenfunction is a unidirectional plane wave, and that this feature has potential applications in quantum device design. The text includes references to several related papers for further reading.

 The article discusses the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) thermal activation law, which is used to describe the glass transitions in bulk polymer systems. This law is similar to the Arrhenius thermal activation law but includes a temperature singularity in the denominator of the equation. The singularity occurs at a dynamical temperature, which is lower than the thermodynamic glass transition temperature and is never quite attained. The VFT law's critical slowing down is experimentally well-obeyed in bulk polymer glasses.  The article derives the VFT thermal activation law using quantum mechanical considerations. The transition rate per unit time for an activated process involves an absolute squared transition amplitude (matrix element) times a density of final states, and the logarithm of the density of final states represents the final entropy. The theoretical problem is to deduce the nature of the excitations and compute the entropy of activation from the logarithm of the final state's energy.  The article also discusses how the VFT activation process is often observed by measuring viscosity in practice, and the prediction for the activation free energy is subject to an experimental test of the scaling critical index in the equation. The article then considers the problem of how much activation energy would be required to remove a given section of chain from the condensed matter piece of polymer and discusses the activation energy to slide a section of polymer chain along a given path, which is expected to decrease sharply as the distance from the boundary surface increases.  The article provides a derivation for VFT activated transition rates in bulk polymer glasses using micro-canonical counting of the number of closed polymer chain configurations within the bulk glassy system and maps the configuration counting into the self-avoiding polygon problem. The activation energy per link determining the chain mobility also determines the dynamical glass transition temperature in the empirical VFT law, and the critical indices are calculated as in Flory's theory. The article also stresses that the dynamical glass transition temperature varies with the distance from the surface boundary due to polymer strings localized near the surface boundary being more mobile than the polymer chains embedded in the bulk. For sufficiently thin films, the VFT activation law becomes modified as in equations ([se1]-[se3]).

 This text appears to be discussing the behavior of Stokes parameters in a system involving an X-like 4-level atomic ensemble illuminated by a linearly polarized light in an optical cavity. The authors have studied the fluctuations of two Stokes parameters, which are proportional to the quadrature noise and the polarization squeezing of the system. They find that the squeezed and antisqueezed Stokes parameters can be found without the need to lock phase-shift differences, as they are automatically done in this system.  The authors have also investigated the contributions of self-rotation (SR) and saturation to squeezing and compared them to a full quantum calculation. They find that the propensity for squeezing from SR is cancelled by atomic noise at low frequencies, so the squeezing originates from the Kerr effect. The mean field mode is squeezed via usual saturation effects, while vacuum mode squeezing is induced by the mean field via crossed Kerr effect. Both SR and crossed Kerr effects can be dissociated in a bad cavity configuration, allowing for high squeezing values.  The text also provides expressions for the susceptibility matrix and correlation matrix for the field, which correspond to approximating the atomic ensemble as a Kerr medium. The associated correlation matrix shows that the atomic noise comes only from frequency-independent linear losses of the Kerr medium in the kerr limit. Similar matrices can be derived for the other field. At low frequencies, however, these matrices need to be completed with additional terms due to SR effects, which result in significant noise on all quadratures of the field for frequencies of order of the Rabi frequency. For frequencies much larger than the Rabi frequency, the sr noise terms vanish, allowing for crossed Kerr effect to produce squeezing.

 The article discusses the ongoing mystery of dark energy and the cosmological constant, specifically addressing the challenges of explaining both the smallness of the cosmological constant and the coincidence problem. While models inspired by string theory and anthropical models have their merits, they each face difficulties in providing satisfactory solutions to these problems. The article then proposes an alternative model involving decaying dark matter (DDM), which can potentially address both issues. This DDM model suggests that a small fraction of primary DDM particles decays into a scalar field with proper self-interaction potential, leading to quintessential behavior at late times. The advantages of this model include the natural emergence of the late-time energy yield and its correlation with the amount of dark matter. However, the article only explores the plausibility of this model and leaves a more detailed study for future work.  The authors consider the cosmological parameters for this model to be an initial density where @xmath6 is an early time in the universe. They present preliminary results in two figures: one showing the fit of quintessence models on publicly available supernova Ia data, and another depicting the evolution of various types of matter from decoupling of CMB photons to the present day. The authors conclude that their model can potentially obtain the present value of cosmological parameters without fine-tuning, but acknowledge that many issues need to be addressed before the model can be fully believed. These include determining the mass and form of the potential for the scalar field's condensation and understanding the time variation of the equation of state for this type of matter.

 The article discusses the existence of heavy hadronic molecules, which are composed of a pair of heavy hadrons instead of a pair of heavy quarks. This assumption was based on the similarities between the heavy meson-heavy antimeson system and the deuteron. The first experimental data supporting this molecular scheme was found in 2003 with the discovery of the X(3872) by the Belle collaboration. Since then, many other XYZ states have been discovered, making the X(3872) and X(1) a natural candidates to have a molecular structure.  The authors use heavy quark spin symmetry (hQSS) and heavy quark flavor symmetry (hFS) to analyze the X(3872) and X(1). They also discuss the implications of hidden local symmetries (HDS). The results are presented in table [tab: predictions].  The article is organized as follows. First, they introduce their effective field theory based on hQSS and hFS. Second, they discuss HDS and its implications. Finally, they present their results.  At lowest order, hQSS and hFS impose that the dynamics of the system do not depend on the heavy quark spin or flavor. The authors use Racah algebra to obtain potentials in every possible channel, which are displayed in table [tab: potentials]. They then solve the Lippmann-Schwinger equation in each channel using the previously fitted constants to obtain their results.  The sources of error in the analysis include the masses of the X(3872) and other resonances, the ratio of the amplitude decays of the X(3872), and the two effective field theory expansions used in this work. The authors take the errors for hQSS to be δc (charm sector) and δb (bottom sector) for hads. They then obtain a unique error by adding all different sources in quadrature.  The analysis predicts the existence of several heavy meson-doubly heavy baryon molecular partners of the X(3872) and X(1). The same effective field theory approach could also be extended to study doubly heavy baryon-double heavy antibaryon molecular systems in the future.

 This text describes how different types of truncated sums, including Fourier, Gauss, Kummer, and exponential sums, can emerge from fixing three parameters in an oscillation equation while varying the fourth parameter. The example given is in the context of optics and interferometry, where electric fields for different arms of an interferometer are added to form a resultant electric field in the detector.  The text explains how the length, wave length, index of refraction, and time delay can be varied to observe different types of truncated sums. The number of terms in the sum can be controlled by doubling the elements in the interferometer. The text also discusses a train of pulses with equal amplitudes and frequencies, where the electric fields from each pulse are superimposed to form the resultant intensity at the detector.  The text further considers a system with several oscillations with the same amplitude and initial phases but different frequencies, leading to beats when the frequency difference is an integer. The text proposes a physical realization of this idea using high-harmonic generated frequencies in light.  Finally, the text discusses varying the amplitude of individual oscillations by considering the case of linearly polarized light passing through Faraday cells with different rotation angles. The resulting electric field is the superposition of the fields from each pathway. The intensity in the detector is then given by the square of the magnitude of the resultant electric field.  The text concludes by mentioning that these classical factorization algorithms have exponential complexity and suggests that an extension to entangled quantum systems could lead to a quantum computing parallelism with an exponential speedup of factorization. The work has been supported by various grants and acknowledges stimulating discussions and critical reading from N. Vitanov. The author also mentions related work by Tamma et al.

 The text discusses the limitations of computable learning algorithms in the statistical learning paradigm, specifically focusing on the trade-off between universality and sample complexity. The author uses a probabilistic method to show that there exists a concept that can make any computable learning algorithm request an arbitrarily large number of samples, even if the distribution is uniform. This result contrasts with uncomputable learning methods in the same universal setting whose sample complexity can be bounded independently of the distribution.  The author also mentions the need for a measure to compare different learning algorithms in terms of sample complexity and the importance of considering computation time in the analysis. Overall, the text highlights the challenges and limitations of computable learning algorithms in the statistical learning paradigm and suggests directions for future research.

 This text appears to be a section from a research paper about the electroweak corrections to longitudinal gauge boson scattering and their impact on unitarity bounds in the Standard Model (SM). The authors discuss how electroweak logarithms suppress the amplitude and cross section at high energies compared to tree level results, but become less important for heavier Higgs masses due to the proximity of the Landau pole. For lighter Higgs masses, these corrections play a significant role in restoring unitarity by pushing the scale where unitarity is broken close to the Landau pole energy scale. The authors also mention that their approach becomes intractable above the Landau pole of the quartic coupling. They thank several colleagues for discussions and correspondence, and acknowledge funding from various sources. The paper includes references to previous works by the same authors and others.

 This text discusses the abundance of carbon monoxide (C) with respect to hydrogen (H2) in protoplanetary disks, specifically focusing on T Tauri stars (TTs) and Pre-Main Sequence Stars (PMS). The authors note that C and dust grains trace distinct vertical layers in the disk, with C existing near the surface layers and dust grains at the midplane. The value of @xmath60, which represents the mass fraction of C near the Photodissociation Region (PDR) with respect to the total mass, is presented for various stars.  The authors find that TTs generally have lower values of @xmath60 than PMS, with typical values being an order of magnitude or less for TTs and higher for PMS. They suggest that this difference could be due to either a reduced carbon abundance (@xmath63) or a reduced gas surface density (@xmath62).  They argue that the former case is more likely, as the chemical lifetime of C has been theoretically predicted to drop substantially with increasing gas densities. The typical density at the disk midplane is estimated to be much higher than in the tenuous protostellar envelope, leading to a reduction in carbon abundance at the TT stage.  The authors also consider the alternative explanation that overall gas depletion is responsible for the observed difference in @xmath60 values between TTs and PMS. However, they argue against this possibility based on observational data and disk models. Instead, they propose that time-dependent sink mechanisms, such as the depletion of volatiles like C-containing species at the surface with disk evolution, may be responsible for the observed difference in @xmath60 values.  The text includes tables presenting various observational data, including the star name, spectral type, distance, and @xmath240.XX values (which represent various properties of the stars). The authors acknowledge the support of various grants and institutions, as well as contributions from H. Nomura and D. Ishimoto.

 It appears that you are describing the behavior of a system with multiple variables, specifically identified as @xmath12, @xmath181, @xmath182, @xmath183, @xmath40, @xmath286, and others. The text discusses how the state of this system changes depending on the value of @xmath12 and other factors.  In the first case (i), when @xmath12 is small, the variables @xmath145 and @xmath156 are imbalanced, leading to a decrease in both. There is also a peak around @xmath237 for large values of @xmath12. The difference in @xmath14 has a slight effect on @xmath136.  In the second case (ii), when @xmath282, there appears another peak at @xmath283, which corresponds to the 1-3 rich state. By decreasing @xmath12, the 2-4 rich state first appears and then becomes unstable, giving way to the 1-3 rich state when @xmath12 is extremely small (@xmath290).  In the third case, for large values of @xmath12, a single peak around @xmath292 appears, which corresponds to the fixed point in the continuum limit. At @xmath186, double peaks appear around @xmath293 and @xmath294, which correspond to the 2-4 rich state. By decreasing @xmath12 further, the skirt of the low-density (left) peak touches @xmath295, implying that @xmath52 (and @xmath53) is likely to reach @xmath0, and thus, the 2-4 rich state loses stability.  For small values of @xmath12, the flows of molecules dominate the system, and @xmath197 reflects @xmath297, regardless of how the continuum limit is imbalanced by the reactions. In cases (a) and (b), different reaction constants result in different behaviors for @xmath296 and @xmath232.

 This text describes the discovery and characterization of white dwarfs, specifically those that pulsate, using both ground-based telescopes and the Kepler space telescope. The authors discuss the challenges of detecting pulsational variability in these stars due to their faintness and low amplitude pulsations. They also mention the importance of the K2 mission for observing more pulsating white dwarfs. The text includes acknowledgments for funding sources and conversations with other researchers.  Keywords: white dwarfs, pulsational variability, Kepler space telescope, ground-based telescopes, K2 mission.  Here's a summary of the main points in the text:  * The authors discuss the discovery of two massive white dwarfs that pulsate, with the second being the second most massive known to do so. * White dwarfs of this mass likely have at least partially crystallized interiors. * The authors did not detect photometric variability in a relatively faint target, but it's possible that this white dwarf pulsates at lower amplitude. * The Kepler mission would have provided an order-of-magnitude improvement on the detection limits for these targets if they had been observed from space. * Using color selection from the KIS survey and medium-resolution spectroscopy from ISIS, the authors discovered and characterized 42 new white dwarfs in the original Kepler mission field. * Nine of these objects were confirmed to be zzCeti stars using follow-up high-speed photometry from ground-based telescopes. * Four of these stars were observed from space using the Kepler space telescope, and a report on the first zzCeti found in this project was published. * The failure of the second reaction wheel that kept the Kepler precisely pointed towards its original mission field occurred shortly after the discovery of many of these new zzCeti stars, leaving sparse ground-based discovery light curves as the only time-series photometry for most targets. * The K2 mission will cover a significantly larger footprint and is expected to observe more than a thousand white dwarfs, dozens of which are likely to be pulsating. * Several important discoveries have already come from these K2 observations of pulsating white dwarfs. * Color selection methods honed in this work have ensured that dozens of pulsating white dwarfs will be observed by K2 for up to 80 days at a time, using selection from a variety of multiwavelength photometric surveys. * The authors acknowledge funding sources and conversations with other researchers during the preparation of this manuscript.

 This text describes a study investigating the initial mass function (IMF) of stars and brown dwarfs in different stellar clusters using cumulative distribution functions of binary-to-total masses (btps). The authors find that the observed data are most consistent with a Chabrier IMF, which is falling in the brown dwarf regime. They also discuss the challenges of detecting IMF variations and suggest that models that depend weakly on initial conditions may be required.  The text provides several key findings:  1. The authors find that 37% of their simulations have a probability equal to or lower than what was found assuming a Chabrier IMF, while only 0.36-0.1% of the simulations had probabilities as low or lower when assuming a falling power-law IMF. 2. The authors suggest that the imf follows a Chabrier IMF in the brown dwarf regime below 0.03 solar masses, which would result in a higher number of stars compared to brown dwarfs. 3. They discuss the challenges of detecting IMF variations, including the need for well-sampled populations and a larger set of clusters to detect even small imf variations with initial conditions. 4. The authors mention that there are still expectations of variations in the imf at the lowest masses where the opacity limit for fragmentation can be reached and metallicity could be imprinted on the lower mass limit. 5. They provide a list of several stellar clusters, including their ages, distances, number of members, average mass, and btp values.  The text also mentions previous studies and ideas related to IMF variations, such as those by Kroupa (2001), Bate et al. (2003), and Bonnell et al. (2003). It also discusses the challenges of detecting imf variations and suggests that models that depend weakly on initial conditions may be required. Overall, the text presents an analysis of IMF data from several stellar clusters and provides insights into the possible shape of the IMF in the brown dwarf regime.

 The present communication aims to establish the curvature effect on Rashba spin-orbit interaction induced spin polarization in a three-terminal bridge setup using a tight-binding framework based on Green's function formalism. The authors consider two different shaped geometries of the same material: a linear-like and a ring-like one. In the former case, they find absolute zero spin polarization in output leads when the sample is linear, while finite polarization is obtained for the ring-shaped geometry in two output leads. This phenomenon holds true for any higher-terminal bridge setup and independent of lead-conductor interface geometries.  The authors also mention that other geometric configurations might exhibit finite spin polarization in output leads except for the linear one, leading to a robust effect of curvature on spin polarization in a multi-terminal bridge system. All results are obtained at absolute zero temperature, though the finite temperature extension is trivial. The authors ignore the effect of electron-electron (e-e) interaction but mention possible ways to incorporate it using mean field approximation or other methods.  The communication emphasizes that the curvature effect on spin polarization in a three-terminal bridge setup is an interesting phenomenon, as finite polarization is obtained for ring-shaped geometries while absolute zero polarization is noticed when the sample becomes linear. This behavior is expected to be universal and holds true for any other set of parameter values. The authors encourage further experimental investigation to explore this effect in more detail.

 The Lab for Adaptive Optics (LAO) at the University of California, Santa Cruz is currently developing two key Adaptive Optics (AO) technologies for large telescopes: Multi-Conjugate AO (MCAO) and Multi-Object AO (MOAO). Both technologies utilize tomographic reconstructions using multiple guide stars. MCAO aims to achieve a high Strehl ratio over a large field of view by accounting for anisoplanatism using multiple deformable mirrors at optical conjugates. MOAO, on the other hand, attempts to achieve very high Strehls over small fields embedded in larger uncorrected fields.  The LAO testbed uses three optically addressed Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) from Hamamatsu Photonics, which allow for nearly 600,000 control elements, significantly more than current MEMS. SLMs have been successful in the biological sciences and will also be useful for MEMs DMs. The testbed also incorporates a high stroke mirror to eliminate the need for SLMs to phase wrap and test possible AO configurations called "woofer-tweeter" setups.  The authors presented initial results from the testbed in Ammons et al. (2006), demonstrating the effectiveness of tomography at finding turbulence layers and achieving high Strehls with both MCAO and MOAO. The testbed uses etched glass Kolmogorov phase plates as turbulence generators, simulating a normal atmosphere's worth of wavefront aberration.  The authors reported on their attempts to flatten the Alpao DM52 mirror using open-loop control and compared the results with Wooferfit predictions. Their initial attempt resulted in a residual surface flatness deviation of approximately 11 @xmath0 @xmath1, which they improved by fitting a typical Kolmogorov wavefront. The comparison between the measured mirror surface and the predicted shape showed a disagreement of 25 @xmath0 @xmath1 over the clear aperture but was noticeably better within the central portion and when apertured down to 90% of the clear aperture. These results are significant as they represent open-loop control without feedback from residual wavefront measurements, applicable to systems like MOAO configurations mentioned earlier. The authors have also tested the Alpao DM52 as a woofer DM and shown it has promising open-loop characteristics. Initial results look good for woofer-tweeter implementation in their MCAO testbed.  The authors acknowledge funding from the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation and support from the National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center for Adaptive Optics.

 This text appears to be a scientific research paper discussing the spectral analysis of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), specifically focusing on the two-blackbody plus power law (2bbpl) model. The authors suggest that GRBs exhibit a common radiation mechanism, as evidenced by the similarity of spectral evolution in certain cases. They propose a spine-sheath jet structure to explain the observed thermal and non-thermal emission.  The text also mentions the correlation between the keV mev data (obtained using Swift X-ray Telescope, Nustar, and Chandra) and the Gev energy emission detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The authors find a significant correlation between the Gev photon fluence and the non-thermal component of the 2bbpl model fitted to the keV mev data. They suggest that the powerlaw component of the 2bbpl model shares a common origin with the Gev emission, which is likely produced at higher radii by synchrotron emission.  The authors plan to develop a spine-sheath jet model and apply it to a large set of GRBs to obtain physical parameters of the jet. They also suggest testing whether one or more spectral components of the 2bbpl model can be used to study GRB correlations. The text mentions that RB is supported by various grants from the Polish Science Foundation and the National Science Center of Poland.

 This text appears to be a list of references for a research paper on the rotation properties of neutron stars. The authors have studied the maximum rotation frequency of solitary neutron stars and compared it with that of cold neutron stars. They found that the minimum rotation period of solitary neutron stars is larger than the corresponding limit for cold neutron stars, and this conclusion is strengthened when additional secular instabilities are included in rapidly uniformly rotating protoneutron stars. The authors acknowledge the help of several researchers in the field and the support of various grants and institutions. The numerical computations were performed on Silicon Graphics workstations. Some of the key references include works by Bardeen, DeWitt, Baumgarte, Bombaci, Bonazzola, Burrows, Cook, Cutler, Friedman, Haensel, Hashimoto, Janka, Kazanas, Lai, Lattimer, Lipunova, Mueller, Oegelman, Pandharipande, Salgado, Sawyer, Soni, Shapiro, Teukolsky, Tassoul, and Yoshida.

 This text describes a study on the Flashing Ratchet model, which is a two-state approximation of the dynamics of molecular motors moving along an asymmetric but globally periodic potential in a strongly fluctuating thermal environment. The system switches between two states: the on state, where the particle experiences stochastic motion in an asymmetric piece-wise linear potential, and the off state, where it undergoes simple one-dimensional diffusion.  The authors perform molecular dynamics simulations of this system in the presence of a Langevin heat bath and study the velocity response function and steady-state correlations using the correlation functions. They find that both the velocity auto-correlation function and the steady-state correlation decorrelate to zero at long times. They also calculate the mobility, diffusion constant, and violation integral as a function of the asymmetry parameter.  The study shows that the steady-state diffusion constant is always suppressed in the flashing ratchet and moves closer to free diffusion for the most asymmetric ratchet. The violation integral reaches its minimum at the symmetric ratchet but remains non-zero due to the switching between the on and off states. Setting switching rates would restore equilibrium.  The authors present a unified derivation of modified fluctuation dissipation relations (MFDR) at non-equilibrium steady states using the Agarwal formalism, showing that all versions of MFDR are intrinsically equivalent to each other. They also extend their study to other models of molecular motors, stochastic particle pumps, polymer translocation dynamics, and dynamics of self-propelled particles.

 This text appears to describe a mathematical model for population dynamics, specifically a replicator equation on a simplex. The model includes variables x\_0, x\_202, and x\_203, with x\_202 being a stationary point and x\_203 being constant. The existence of periodic orbits is implied due to the stationary point's periodic behavior.  The text then introduces a constant population of one individual and defines a transformation. The replicator equation for x\_0 is derived, which is a particular class of differential equations on the simplex as a submanifold of a higher-dimensional space.  The authors consider different parametrizations of the simplex and compute the Jacobian matrices for each case. They also discuss the exponential family and its relationship to the expectation parameters.  The text then introduces a univariate statistical model with centered pivotal quantities (vector fields) and discusses the variation of these quantities over time.  Overall, this text appears to be discussing mathematical models for population dynamics and statistical analysis of those models. The specific focus is on replicator equations and their relationship to statistical models.

 This text appears to be a mathematical proof or description of how to construct smooth wavelet frames with compact support for a given Hilbert space. The construction involves selecting a bounded set X, a function phi of class C^k, and a set Y of points such that the conditions y_i + h are separated and y_i are in X for some small h. The collection {T_j(phi)} is then shown to be a frame for the Hilbert space L^2(R), where T_j is the translation operator by j.  The text also notes that not all wavelet frames have the property that their translations form a frame, and that for well-localized wavelets, reconstruction from wavelet coefficients may not be stable using the standard method of reconstructing at each level and summing over levels. However, it is shown that this can still be done using a dual frame of the wavelet frame. The text also mentions some references for further reading on frames and wavelets.

 This text appears to be discussing the topic of cosmic reionization, which is the process by which the universe became ionized after the recombination epoch. The authors are presenting new results and findings from their research on this topic, including observations of the star formation rate (SFR) history and the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM), as well as simulations to better understand the heating and clumping during this period.  They note that recent optical and IR measurements suggest a late epoch of full reionization around redshift z = 0, which is consistent with the observed decrease in numbers of high-redshift galaxies and Lyα emitters, as well as IGM damping wing intrusion into Lyα transmission profiles in high-redshift quasar spectra. However, reconciling this late reionization with the CMB optical depth requires an epoch of partial ionization.  The authors suggest that an additional optical depth may arise from early sources of UV/X-ray photons at redshift z = 17, and they discuss the implications for Planck and future redshifted 21-cm experiments. They also mention ongoing surveys for high-redshift galaxies, Lyα emitters, and QSO near-zone sizes to better quantify the rise of neutral fraction.  The authors plan to carry out more detailed modeling of the 21-cm signal, as well as larger IGM simulations with discrete sources of ionizing radiation and radiative transfer to capture the heating and clumping more accurately. They also mention the potential for discriminants of various SFR histories from the duration of the reionization transition and the 21-cm emission during the heating phase.  The text includes several tables with data on simulations, as well as references to previous work and discussions with colleagues. The research was supported by grants from NASA and NSF.

 This text describes the steps involved in applying an out-of-sample extension algorithm to extend a function defined on a dataset to new data points using the Laplacian pyramid method. The algorithm involves calculating the orthogonal projection of a vector onto the range of a matrix, extending vectors to larger dimensions, setting scale parameters, defining Gaussian kernels, estimating numerical rank, applying randomized singular value decomposition (RANSAC) and singular value decomposition (SVD), and finally obtaining approximations and their extensions at different scales. The Laplacian pyramid method is a multi-scale algorithm for extending empirical functions defined on a dataset to new data points using mutual distances between the data points. The performance of four methods, including Nyström extension and MSE algorithm, are compared in the experiment using a dataset with anomalous data points. The out-of-sample extension algorithm using weights from the tangent space is applied to detect anomalies by computing Mahalanobis distances for each newly arrived data point. The paper also presents an efficient out-of-sample extension scheme for dimensionality reduction maps and applies it to both synthetic and real-life data, providing good results in mapping data from the manifold to the image manifold and detecting abnormal data points. The research was supported by various grants and funds.

 This text appears to be discussing the behavior of certain mesons, specifically the @xmath68-meson and the @xmath113-meson, in the context of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The authors are comparing the results of calculations using a full effective potential with an approximation using a mean-field expansion. They also mention that the mass ratio of these mesons is a significant parameter for describing chiral symmetry breaking at different temperatures.  The text includes references to several papers and reviews, some of which were presented at workshops on QCD at finite baryon density in Bielefeld, Germany, in 1998. The authors also cite works by Stepanov, Berges, Rajagopal, Harada, and Shibata, as well as several other papers for further reading on the topic.  The text suggests that it may be premature to discuss experimental signatures for the QCD phase transition based on the behavior of sigma widths, but that the mass ratio itself is a significant theoretical parameter. The authors also mention that the @xmath113-meson's partial width by strong interaction should vanish at high enough temperature.  The text includes several citations to works published in various journals and conference proceedings, including Physics Letters B, Physical Review D, and Zeitschrift für Physik C. The authors also cite reviews by Satz, Specht, Stock, Jacob, Carruthers and Rafelski, Shuryak, Gross, Pisarski, Yaffe, Cleymans, Matsumoto, Nakano, Umezawa, Kalashnikov, Casalbuoni, Linden, Sinha, and Raha.

 This text describes a study on transport characteristics of a double quantum dot system in the Coulomb blockade regime using Fano factor measurements. The authors show that the Fano factor in the one-electron blockade region is super-Poissonian and can be used to determine the interaction parameter between two electrons in the double quantum dot, revealing information about quantum correlations created during tunneling.  The text begins by discussing how increasing temperature washes out sharp steps but leaves plateaus c and d visible, making it difficult to extract the interaction parameter from the Fano factor. The authors suggest looking at full counting statistics for a more detailed view of transport characteristics. They aim to find the cumulant generating function (CGF), which is related to the probability of charges passing through the system during measurement time.  The authors choose to count charges in the left lead and change the left tunneling rates in the off-diagonal elements of the transport matrix. The smallest eigenvalue of the matrix determines the CGF. They provide an analytical expression for the Fano factor in a certain region, where they include one-electron states and the two-electron singlet, with relevant energy differences smaller than the bias.  The text then discusses a more complicated situation involving four states, where they neglect the least suppressed transition and calculate the series expansion for the Fano factor assuming the temperature is much smaller than the singlet-triplet splitting. The results agree with their numerical calculations.  In conclusion, the authors demonstrate that noise measurements in the Coulomb blockade regime of a double quantum dot can reveal interesting information about quantum correlations created during tunneling. They thank several organizations for financial support and cite relevant references.

 This text discusses the behavior of a thin spherical shell and a rope near a black hole, with respect to the weak energy condition. The authors argue that a thin spherical shell would violate the weak energy condition when it is stationary and arbitrarily close to the horizon. However, they claim that this conclusion can be corrected for a rope by assuming that its fibers are radial.  The text derives an expression for the stresses in the rope using the equation of motion ([radial]) and shows that the weak energy condition is obeyed even when the rope's end is infinitesimally close to the horizon. The discrepancy with a previous result by Gibbons et al. arises due to a missing term in their calculation.  The authors suggest that a suitably designed rope could be used to deposit parcels of fluid at rest near the horizon, resolving the accretion paradox. They cite several related works for further reading.

The third paper is from "The Astrophysical Journal" and has a different format for listing the authors and their affiliations.  The numbers following each author's name in the first and second papers are likely to be their astronomical object designations or identifiers, along with their right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec), magnitudes, and other relevant information. The units of RA and Dec are typically hours, minutes, and seconds, while magnitudes can be in various systems such as visual magnitude or flux density in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The third paper does not have these numbers listed for each author, but it does include their names, affiliations, and contributions to the research project. The publication details are also different, with "The Astrophysical Journal" being a common journal for publishing astronomical research.

 This text appears to be discussing the results of a study on the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in graphene, specifically focusing on the ground states and excitations at certain filling factors in the Landau levels. The authors have used a combination of exact diagonalization and composite fermion theory to identify possible FQHE states allowed by SU(4) symmetry. They found new states that have no analog in gallium arsenide (GaAs), and showed that for some composite fermion states, the fully polarized ground state wins, while for others, compact su(4) singlet structures are possible. The study also estimated parameter regimes where these states should occur and identified SU(4) skyrmions as the lowest energy charged excitations. The authors acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation and thank the HPC group at Penn State University for assistance and computing time.

 In this text, the authors discuss the derivation of the star formation rate (SFR) surface density using equations ([eqb1]) and ([eqb2]). They apply these equations to Hα line images and Spitzer 24μm images for two galaxies. The resulting SFR surface density maps are created by applying equation ([eqb2]) to the Hα and Spitzer 24μm images, which are then convolved and rebinned to appropriate resolutions.  The authors also discuss the possible dependence of the X-factor on the star formation rate using equations ([eqxs2]) and ([eqxs3]). They assume that dust tracers of molecular gas give an accurate representation of the true surface density, and they find the parameters @xmath178, @xmath174 for m@xmath051 and @xmath179, @xmath171 for m@xmath083 from the fits in figure [fig18]. The uncertainties of these quantities are dominated by systematics.  The authors then apply equations ([eqxs4]) and ([eqxs5]) to the current data to obtain @xmath180, @xmath66 for m@xmath051 and 0.79, @xmath67 for m@xmath083 in units of M⊙/yr/kpc².  The text also mentions that the formal uncertainties of @xmath68 using the current data are 3-4%, but the effects of systematics on @xmath68 are difficult to estimate. The authors assume that dust tracers give an accurate representation of the true surface density, and they find that the fits in the second and fourth panels of figure [fig18] yield the parameters for m@xmath051 and m@xmath083 respectively. However, the uncertainties of these quantities are dominated by systematics.

 This text describes the analysis of the random walks of molecular motors along filaments, focusing on how confining walls affect their behavior. The authors derive analytical solutions using both lattice models and continuum equations for systems without and with confining walls. They find that in the presence of confining walls, the probability to be bound to the filament and the effective velocity exhibit crossover behavior, transitioning from a three-dimensional solution without confining walls at short times to a two-dimensional solution with an effective reattachment rate at long times. These results are relevant for understanding intracellular phenomena such as axonal transport and for designing artificial systems in nanotechnology using molecular motors as transporters.

 This paper discusses the principle of self-consistency in the context of closed cycles in quantum mechanics, specifically using a device that can be interpreted as an uncontrollable time machine. The authors find that the probability of a cycle occurring is unity if the initial and final states are the same (self-consistent cycle) and zero if they are orthogonal (inconsistent cycle). They suggest that this principle may have a quantum mechanical explanation based on the interference of amplitudes associated with different pathways around the cycle. The authors also draw parallels to the classical principle of least action, suggesting that consistent cycles have a non-zero probability of occurring due to a net non-zero amplitude. The paper was supported by a grant from the Australian Research Council and references several works by Y. Aharonov and collaborators on related topics.

 In this subsection, the authors revisit the issue of the pairwise velocity distribution function (pvdf) of PSCz galaxies and its comparison with predictions from cold dark matter (CDM) models. They combine the biasing effect with their analytical model in a complementary manner using 5-body simulation data.  The authors adopt the Colberg-Lacquata-Weinberg (CLW) biasing scheme, which assumes that the selection function of galaxies in a halo of mass M is proportional to 1.15 times the halo mass function. This puts lower weight on massive clusters where velocity dispersion is large, resulting in a smaller mean pvd. The Las Campanas Redshift Survey data are consistent with this prescription, while PSCz data prefer a much larger value.  Additionally, the authors consider another biasing effect to account for the observed density-morphology relation of galaxies. Spiral galaxies avoid the central region of massive clusters, resulting in a suppressed pvd especially for modified NFW profiles with stronger central concentration. The authors attempt to incorporate this effect by introducing a selection probability that depends on the distance from the center of the halo.  The results show good agreement with simulation results and support the shape of the pvdf being well approximated by an exponential in a fairly insensitive manner to either cosmological models or dark halo density profiles. However, even with the density morphology relation, the pvd of IRAS PSCz galaxies is still too small to be reconciled within the current model.  The authors have provided a detailed prediction for the pvdf applying the dark matter halo approach and derived it in a self-consistent manner with the assumed density profile for the first time. However, they neglected the halo-halo contribution, making their predictions quantitatively valid only on small scales.  The authors also apply an empirical biasing scheme into their model to predict the pvd of galaxies and reproduce previous simulation results using their analytical method. They confirm that the very small pvd estimated for PSCz galaxies is difficult to be reconciled with a simplistic biasing model and/or the underlying CDM model. The discrepancy between prediction and observation indicates the presence of velocity bias, in addition to other selection effects.  The authors plan to incorporate the effect of velocity bias into their scheme to account for the pvd of galaxies in future work.

 This text appears to be discussing a solution to the Einstein field equations in the context of a cosmological model with anisotropic pressure and electromagnetic fields. The tensor given by (eq : setef) is assumed to have a diagonal form for any solution of the system (eq : maxsoltime), where xmath71 and xmath72 are solutions.  Two possible interpretations for the anisotropic pressure are suggested: superimposing the stress-energy tensors of two pressureless fluids moving in opposite directions along a specific direction, or considering cosmic strings aligned with the Clifford parallels expanding and contracting with space while preserving the structure of the Hopf fibration.  The metric in this model is similar to that of the closed FLRW universe, leading to a system analogous to the Friedmann equations with additional terms from the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor. The first equation can be rewritten as xmath81 using the third equation from (eq : freq), and the second equation can be used to obtain the pressure xmath74.  The matter in this model satisfies the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions if xmath84. However, the scale factor xmath88 approaches xmath87 as xmath88 tends to zero, indicating that matter particles approach the speed of light near the big bang or the big crunch.  The behavior of the scale factor xmath88 can be derived from an effective potential formulation using (eq : fried1) and (eq : friedrho). The potential is a function of xmath88, but also depends on three parameters xmath7, xmath82, and xmath95. A positive cosmological constant is required to have an unstable equilibrium point, reproducing previous results concerning the Einstein universe.  Except in the case of the Einstein universe and its two asymptotes, the electromagnetic field performs a finite number of oscillations during the history of the universe, proportional to its lifetime as measured in conformal time. At any given epoch, these fields will appear mostly constant and may serve as models of primordial magnetic fields.  The text cites several references for further reading, including works by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler; Wald; Hawking and Ellis; Raada; and Thorne.

 This text appears to be discussing the properties of solutions in a theory called Bigravity, specifically focusing on the Isam-Storey exact solution. The authors find that this solution cannot represent a black hole but rather the exterior solution to a spherical star. They also identify several phases in the canonical formalism and discuss phase transitions that occur for certain critical values of temperature, depending on the coupling and potential parameters.  The text mentions entropy, free energy, and temperature, and plots are shown to illustrate the results. The authors vary different couplings and charges while ensuring stability and unitarity of the linear theory. They find multi-valued free energy functions for some cases, leading to no phase transitions, and first-order phase transitions for others. Additionally, they discuss a hypothetical zero-order phase transition.  The authors also mention that this is not a generic property of Bigravity but rather specific to the potential chosen by Isam and Storey. They suggest that more integration constants may be present in solutions with more generic potentials, potentially allowing for fine-tuning to produce a regular horizon.  The text includes references to several papers for further reading.

 This text appears to be a scientific paper about the study of High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs), specifically three individual HMXBs, and their clumpy stellar winds. The authors discuss the determination of minimum and maximum clump radii in these systems, as well as the application of the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion theory. They also compare the wind parameters obtained for the three sources and suggest that differences in the properties of the clumps could be related to the sonic radius where the clumps start, which depends on the supergiant properties.

 This text discusses the findings from various studies regarding the spatial distribution and kinematics of multiple populations in Globular Clusters (GCs). The authors highlight the intriguing result obtained by Larsen et al. (2015) about the radial trends in M15, where primordial giants are more centrally concentrated than enriched ones. They suggest that this could be due to a larger binary fraction for the primordial population in the core of M15.  The authors also mention the importance of considering other factors such as the initial binary properties and spatial distribution of subpopulations, the rate of creation and disruption of binaries, the amount of dynamical evolution, and the structure of the cluster to understand this phenomenon in detail. They suggest future avenues for research, including constraining any differential rotation of subpopulations, quantifying their central spatial distributions in a larger sample of GCs, and measuring the respective binary fractions of subpopulations in the central regions of clusters.  The text also discusses the implications of these findings for the formation of multiple populations in GCs and emphasizes the importance of considering various factors to understand this complex phenomenon. The authors illustrate their points with figures showing the mass density profiles of two tracer populations of evolved stars with a mean stellar mass differing by 0.25 mₗ₁₁ in M15 and NGC 2808, assuming a fully mass-segregated cluster.

 This text appears to discuss the behavior of neutrinos in the early universe and their potential role as dark matter in galaxy clusters. After neutrino decoupling, they were extremely relativistic with a Fermi level given by @xmath141^{1/3} and a temperature @xmath142. The degree of degeneracy was moderate. During adiabatic expansion, the degeneracy is unlikely to change as long as neutrinos remain relativistic.  However, there is a transition from the relativistic to nonrelativistic regime, and in this case, the Fermi level and temperature change, leading to a different degree of degeneracy. The text also mentions that relic neutrinos could have suppressed "free streaming" or preserved the initial fluctuation spectrum due to their partial degeneracy.  The acceptable mass range for fermionic dark matter is between 2 and 4 eV if previously unknown fermions with spin 1/2 dominate, and between 1 and 2 eV if the dark matter consists of a mixture of degenerate relic neutrinos and classical collisionless cold dark matter particles. Both pure fermionic dark matter models and neutrino-CDM mixture models can reproduce the observations equally well.  The text also lists some particle types, their masses, and profiles. These include majorana (p) with a mass of 1 eV, dirac (p) or majorana (p+@xmath162) with a mass of 2 eV, i + dirac (p+@xmath162) with a mass of 4 eV, and a + majorana (p) with a mass of 1 eV. The profiles are not explicitly stated in the given text.

 This text is an abstract from a scientific research paper about the investigation of magnetic fields and differential rotation in cool, rapidly rotating stars. The authors report the detection of surface differential rotation using stellar surface features as tracers, and discuss the implications of their findings for the dynamo processes operating within these stars. They also present simple models to explore the quantitative consequences of angular momentum conservation on potential variations of surface differential rotation over time. The study suggests that the rotation velocity field within the convective zone may resemble that of ultra-fast rotators, with constant angular velocity along cylinders aligned with the rotation axis. The authors argue for the importance of continuing this research to fully explore the capabilities of the new method and to investigate short-term variability and long-term evolution driven by magnetic cycles. They also highlight the potential benefits of using new instruments like ESPADONS on larger telescopes, such as the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, for extending the data set and studying the physical processes in greater detail. The authors thank Corinne Charbonnel for providing models of the internal structure of the stars and express their gratitude to the referee for valuable comments that improved the paper.

 This text discusses the concept of fragile solutions in the context of fluid dynamics, specifically in relation to the Burgers equation. The author argues that there is a symmetry in the Burgers equation, allowing for the conversion of the inviscid Burgers equation into its familiar form by reversing the signs of certain variables. This results in the spontaneous splitting of a single shock into two shocks, which is referred to as the fragile property.  The author also suggests that this fragility may manifest itself in real systems and proposes a picture of turbulence with two temperatures: a negative temperature describing the ensemble of microscopic entities making up the turbulent state, and the usual temperature describing the ensemble at the molecular level. These two ensembles interact weakly but must exchange energy due to the second law of thermodynamics. The author argues that fragile processes, which would result in nonuniqueness and the onset of splitting and proliferation of microscopic entities, occur in the energy range at small scales and extract mechanical energy from the negative temperature bath.  The text also mentions the relevance of this concept to CFD modeling of turbulence and notes that conventional numerical solutions may encounter difficulties when dealing with nonunique models. The author cites several references for further reading.

 The article discusses the search for ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and the investigation of potential clustering in their highest energy events using data from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) detector. The authors report that the HiRes-I monocular detector does not observe any evidence of clustering in its highest energy events, with a 90% confidence level limiting the number of doublets above background coincidence to 3.5. This result implies that no more than 13% of the observed HiRes-I events could be sharing common arrival directions. The authors compare this sensitivity to that of the reported AGASA data set, assuming a 30% energy scale difference between the two experiments. They emphasize that their analysis does not assume any specific astrophysical mechanism for clustering phenomena and cannot claim inconsistency with the AGASA results beyond a specified confidence level. The work is supported by various grants and acknowledges contributions from several institutions and collaborations.

 This text appears to discuss various aspects of interstellar cloud structure, star formation, and the distribution of ionized gas in galaxies. Here is a summary:  * Young HII regions should have radial density gradients reflecting the initial neutral cloud gradient due to the large sound crossing time on a large scale. * Extended components of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) surround most HII regions, with a significant fraction outside the conventional Strömgren sphere. * The mass distribution of purely hierarchical structures should scale as a constant, and observations support this hypothesis. * Elmegreen & Falgarone (1997) modeled hierarchical cloud structure using observed size distributions and density distributions, while Stutzki et al. (1998) used fractal brownian motion for their cloud model. * The physical difference between the two models lies in how small clumps are distributed within larger structures: hierarchical clouds have all small clumps inside larger ones, whereas fractal brownian motion clouds have equal probability of small structure everywhere, although it is weaker outside larger clumps. * The star formation process results in a hierarchically clumped distribution of stars if stars form at all levels in a hierarchy. * Cluster mass functions from observations have power law slopes similar to those expected from hierarchical clouds. * Berkhuijsen (1998) discussed the volume filling factor of warm interstellar medium, and Elmegreen (1997, 1998) explored the hierarchy of interstellar and stellar structures in the Orion star-forming region. * Heithausen et al. (1998) studied small-scale structure in pre-star forming cores using combined mass spectra and scaling laws. * Langer et al. (1997) reported the first astronomical detection of the cumulene carbon chain molecule H2C6 in TMC-1. * Reynolds (1995) discussed diffuse optical emission lines as probes of interstellar and intergalactic ionizing radiation. * Scalo (1990) explored perception of interstellar structure, and Stanimirovic et al. (1998) studied fractal structure in the interstellar medium of the Small Magellanic Cloud. * Wannier et al. (1993) observed warm neutral halos around molecular clouds using V-OH (1665 and 1667 MHz) observations.

 This text describes the supersymmetry transformations and central charge transformations for the vector-tensor multiplet in superfield formalism. The authors note that only one of the two central charges is represented nontrivially due to constraints. They also discuss writing a superfield action for the vector-tensor multiplet, which is a central charge generalization of the type considered in [xcite]. The text concludes by mentioning the connection between the superspace formulation of the vector-tensor multiplet and six-dimensional supersymmetry.  The authors find that the free Lagrangian for all component fields is contained in the lowest component of the superfield, which is invariant under both supersymmetry transformations and central charge transformations up to a total divergence. They prove that all higher components in both @xmath106 and @xmath27 are spacetime total divergences, implying that integrating over spacetime only gives the physical degrees of freedom.  The text also mentions the importance of addressing questions such as duality and finding an unconstrained superpotential for the vector-tensor multiplet in future work. They note that the form of the multiplet described here is explicitly non-interacting but that the superspace formalism allows the description of more complex systems, including non-abelian multiplets and those with gauged central charge and Chern-Simons terms.  The text was supported by grants DE-FG02-95ER40893 and CRG-940784.

 This text describes the new features and capabilities of a statistical toolkit, specifically focusing on the addition of tests for randomness and categorical data analysis. The user can supply input data in the form of CSV files, and the toolkit comes with extensive unit tests to ensure correct implementation of statistical tests.  The new development cycle includes tests such as the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for one or two samples, Mann-Whitney U test for comparing two samples, Fisher's exact test for contingency tables, and an algorithm to calculate the chi-square test with Yates continuity correction. These tests provide complementary information to existing goodness of fit tests and can help detect systematic effects in distributions.  The text also mentions that the toolkit now has a more versatile build system and is capable of handling larger datasets due to its extensions in testing capabilities. The new user layer component allows users to use the toolkit with many spreadsheet applications, making it a powerful data analysis tool for experimental physics problems concerned with data comparisons.  The text also pays tribute to Paolo Viarengo, who contributed to the previous development cycles of the statistical toolkit. There are several references to relevant papers and reports in the field of data analysis and statistics.

 This text appears to be discussing the comparison between two algorithms, Proportional Fairness (PF) and Online Greedy, for managing data buffer lengths in communication networks with renewable energy sources. The PF algorithm is an offline algorithm that schedules renewable energy allocation to minimize the average data buffer length subject to ISR constraints. The Online Greedy algorithm is a real-time algorithm that gives an upper bound on the average data buffer length and derives insights into the performance of the system.  The text provides simulation results for both algorithms regarding the mean data arrival and renewable energy arrival. For small values of mean data arrival, the gap between the two algorithms becomes smaller due to the different behavior of each algorithm in this region. However, the gap remains constant in large value regions. The analysis suggests that the PF algorithm is irrelevant to the mean data arrival, while the Online Greedy algorithm has a slow increase when the initial data is zero and a moderate increase when the renewable energy constraint is active for both slots.  The text also mentions other related works on energy harvesting in communication networks and cognitive radio networks. The authors propose two practical algorithms, the PF algorithm and the Online Greedy algorithm, to minimize the average data buffer length with ISR constraints in the presence of renewable energy sources. They demonstrate that both algorithms can produce effective upper and lower bounds on the average buffer length and provide insights into the performance of the system.

 This text discusses the coherent backscattering effect in a system of two trapped atoms interacting with a probe beam at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, inelastic scattering due to the recoil effect provides which-path information through the Wigner time delay of the phase and amplitude change of the resonant scattering function. However, at finite temperatures, the atomic movement destroys the interference once the average Doppler shift becomes of the order of the resonance width. Which-path information resides in the atomic velocities via resonance conditions, but the duality inequality no longer saturates due to an initial thermal state corresponding to a non-optimal detector preparation. The text also acknowledges collaborators and funding sources.  Keywords: Coherent backscattering, Trapped atoms, Quantum duality, Thermal Doppler shift, Wigner time delay, Resonance conditions.  Abstract: We investigate the coherent backscattering effect in a system of two trapped atoms interacting with a probe beam at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, inelastic scattering due to the recoil effect provides which-path information through the Wigner time delay of the phase and amplitude change of the resonant scattering function. However, at finite temperatures, the atomic movement destroys the interference once the average Doppler shift becomes of the order of the resonance width. Which-path information resides in the atomic velocities via resonance conditions, but the duality inequality no longer saturates due to an initial thermal state corresponding to a non-optimal detector preparation. We acknowledge collaborators and funding sources.  Introduction: The coherent backscattering effect is a phenomenon that arises when a probe beam interacts with a collection of scattering particles in a disordered medium. This effect leads to an enhancement of the backscattered intensity due to quantum interference between different scattering paths [1]. In this work, we focus on a system of two trapped atoms interacting with a probe beam at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, the inelastic scattering due to the recoil effect provides which-path information through the Wigner time delay of the phase and amplitude change of the resonant scattering function [2]. However, at finite temperatures, the atomic movement destroys the interference once the average Doppler shift becomes of the order of the resonance width. Which-path information resides in the atomic velocities via resonance conditions, but the duality inequality no longer saturates due to an initial thermal state corresponding to a non-optimal detector preparation [3].  Zero Temperature: At zero temperature, the trapped atoms interact with the probe beam through elastic and inelastic scattering processes. Elastic scattering occurs when the energy of the incident photon is conserved during the interaction, while inelastic scattering results in a change of the atomic internal state and the emission or absorption of a phonon [4]. The recoil effect, which arises from the conservation of momentum during inelastic scattering, provides which-path information through the Wigner time delay of the phase and amplitude change of the resonant scattering function [2].  Finite Temperature: At finite temperatures, the atomic movement destroys the interference once the average Doppler shift becomes of the order of the resonance width. Which-path information resides in the atomic velocities via resonance conditions, but the duality inequality no longer saturates due to an initial thermal state corresponding to a non-optimal detector preparation [3].  Conclusion: We have studied the coherent backscattering effect from two trapped atoms, a case study for quantitative quantum duality in a physically realistic setting. At zero temperature, inelastic scattering due to the recoil effect provides which-path information through the Wigner time delay of the phase and amplitude change of the resonant scattering function. Further which-path information can be gained by measuring which atom has scattered the photon first, which is possible if the initial position uncertainty is small enough. At finite temperature, the quantum duality is no longer saturated and reads to order 1/2: (2k_in v_rms / |γ|)^2 [5]. We acknowledge collaborators and funding sources.  References: [1] John P.

 The text describes a barrel pixel detector used in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN. The inter-pixel isolation is done using a moderated p-spray technique, allowing the device to operate in a partially depleted mode and safely at high bias voltages up to 600V. The readout chip (ROC) is fabricated in a commercial CMOS process and has purposes such as amplification and buffering of the charge signal from the sensor, zero suppression, threshold adjustment, trigger verification, and voltage regulation.  The detector is read out in a daisy-chained scheme controlled by the token bit manager (TBM) chip. The ROCs are connected to each other through a serial link, and the TBM manages the data transfer between them. The ROCs send their data to the TBM, which then sends it to the next ROC in the chain until all data is received by the data acquisition system.  The text also mentions some testing results of the detector's performance, including detection efficiency and resolution studies. The detection efficiency is found to be lower than expected from simulations due to radiation damage of the sensor under test. The resolution is found to depend on the azimuthal angle and irradiation dose, with a value between 10 and 20 m for sensors irradiated up to 400 Mrad(cm-2).  The text also mentions some references for further reading on the development of the detector, including papers on the ROC design and performance, the TBM design, and radiation damage studies.

 This text describes a study on the quantum phase transition of a spin system on a random graph. The researchers used the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method to investigate the behavior of the system as a function of a control parameter, @xmath23. They found that the weight of the classical ground state increases as @xmath23 is decreased, while the weight of random configurations is much smaller near the critical point. The number of relevant classical configurations contributing to the ground state changes drastically across the transition.  The researchers also monitored selected wavefunction components of the ground state and found that the weight of the classical ground state grows up to a certain value of @xmath23, while the state @xmath25 is still dominant in the paramagnetic phase at the moment of the divergence of the spin-glass susceptibility. They measured various quantities such as energy gap, spin-glass susceptibility, entanglement entropy, long-distance spatial correlations, and average magnetization to high precision on a few samples of different sizes.  The study also compares the results with Fisher's model for random ferromagnetic chains and discusses the implications of their findings. They emphasize that their definition of entanglement entropy on random graphs is an alternative approach and leave open the question of its relation to the standard block entropy. The researchers conclude that the system behaves similarly to a 1D chain in a restricted sense due to the disorder, which perhaps leads to the selection of an effective 1D path of strong bonds. They also note that if the couplings are not random, the number of retained states per block increases significantly, making the numerical DMRG approach impractical.

 This text appears to be a research talk given in the field of nuclear physics, specifically discussing the application of Effective Field Theory (EFT) techniques to bridge the gap between Quark-Gluon Plasma (QCD) variables and macroscopic color-singlet variables. The speaker suggests that this "bridging" comes about due to a possible duality between QCD variables and these macroscopic variables, which they refer to as the Cheshire Cat principle.  The text mentions several papers and references related to this topic, including works by Kaplan, Alford, Rajagopal, Wilczek, Schiffer, and Carter, among others. The speaker also discusses the application of EFT to the proton spin problem in the Chiral Bag model and the concept of qualitons at high density.  The text includes references to various physics journals such as Physics Letters B, Nuclear Physics A, and Physical Review D. It appears that the speaker is presenting research on the application of Effective Field Theory techniques to understand the behavior of quarks and gluons in the context of high-density nuclear matter and the possible connection to macroscopic color-singlet variables using the Cheshire Cat principle.

 This text describes a study using the AIA instrument on SDO to observe downflows, or inflows of chromospheric material, during solar flares. The authors note that these downflows are dark features in the running difference images, indicating lower intensities than the surrounding emission, and they aim to investigate whether this is due to a persistent low intensity or if the downflows brighten over time.  To do this, they follow the intensities along each track in the unsubtracted images and compare them with intensities at several locations outside of the track. They find that the intensity in the center of the feature simply tracks the background intensities measured outside of the downflow, and there is no evidence for the intensities in the downflows rising faster than the background. However, they note that these measurements are difficult to make and subject to considerable uncertainty due to the low contrast of the downflows relative to the ambient emission in the flare.  The authors also discuss some limitations and open questions related to interpreting the downflows as evidence for magnetic reconnection. They mention that the observed velocities are lower than expected based on simple 2D models of Sweet-Parker and Petschek reconnection, and suggest that the interaction of reconnected flux tubes with pre-existing magnetic fields may provide a drag force that slows the downflows. They also note that for most events, the downflows are observed late in the flare and descend into an existing cloud of hot emission, while the initial flare emission forms essentially "in place" and not as a descending loop. Finally, they mention that recent work suggests that density depletions can be formed in reconnecting flux tubes that move through a nonuniform current sheet, but it is not clear how long such depletions would persist or how they relate to chromospheric evaporation.  The authors conclude by noting the importance of considering three-dimensional modeling and the inhomogeneity of the reconnecting magnetic fields in understanding the dynamics and morphology of downflows during solar flares. They also highlight the potential value of high resolution observations of the photospheric magnetic field, such as those taken with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on Hinode, for gaining insights into the spatial scales of magnetic inhomogeneity in the flare plasma.

 It appears that this text describes the calculation of quasinormal modes for gravitational waves emitted by a particle orbiting around a massive object. The text mentions that there are apparent divergences in certain integrals due to the change of integration variables and the vanishing of some terms at the turning point. To avoid these difficulties, the authors choose to use a time coordinate in the integration instead of proper time. They also expand the functions near the turning point and evaluate the integrals using regular functions. The text mentions that their results agree with previous works on quasinormal modes for uniform density stars and polytropic stars. The methods used include the continued fraction expansion method, which was first used to calculate black hole quasinormal modes. The imaginary part of their result has an opposite sign to a previous result due to different definitions of the Fourier transformation. References are provided to several papers for further reading.

 This text appears to be an abstract from a scientific research paper investigating the behavior of bird flocks during the landing process, focusing on the interplay between collective motion and decision making. The authors find that for larger system sizes, there is an increase in temporal coherence as indicated by a scaling relation (equation [lambda - scale]) with parameters @xmath148 and @xmath149. They also explore the effect of interaction radii on the spread of landing times and find that larger interaction radii lead to more coherent decision making. The text discusses the probability density function of the distance traveled by the center of mass of birds in flight, the distribution of maximum depths of excursions before returning to the flock, and the jumps in position of the center of mass during the landing process. The authors suggest that their findings may be relevant for other systems where abrupt behavioral changes occur.

 This text appears to be a scientific research paper discussing the scaling of convective velocities in different systems, specifically in the context of asteroid regolith and granular convection experiments. The authors use experimental data from a vertically shaken glass beads bed to derive a power-law scaling for the representative convective velocity, which they compare qualitatively with previous studies. They also discuss the limitations of their experiment and the need for further studies to understand regolith migration dynamics.  The text includes several equations and references to other works in the field. The main equation presented is Equation ([eq: scaling2]) for estimating convective velocities, and Equation ([eq: scaling1]) for the experimental scaling law of convective velocity. The authors also mention the importance of accurately estimating certain parameters, such as @xmath106, which can significantly affect the results.  The text includes several citations to other works in the field, some of which are listed explicitly and others that are referenced by DOI or PMID numbers. The authors acknowledge the support of various grants and research programs for their work. Overall, the text presents an ongoing investigation into the scaling of convective velocities in different systems and highlights the need for further experimental and theoretical studies to fully understand these phenomena.

 This text appears to be a research article in mathematics, specifically about isospectrality and the dihedral symmetry of graphs. The authors present a rigorous proof that for certain eigenvalues and boundary conditions on the complete graph, there exist subgraphs with the same spectrum but different nodal domains, which are related by a transplantation matrix. They also discuss some open problems and acknowledge the contributions of other researchers.  The text uses mathematical notation extensively, such as @xmath151 for real numbers, @xmath201 for a region in the complete graph, and @xmath220 for the 2d representation of a group. The authors define various functions and eigenfunctions on these graphs, and use coordinates to examine subregions. They also discuss boundary conditions and transplantation matrices.  The main result is stated in Theorem [thm3], which asserts that for certain eigenvalues and boundary conditions, there exist pairs of isospectral graphs related by a transplantation matrix. The proof involves constructing the basis functions on each graph and showing that they are related by the transplantation matrix.  Overall, this text requires a strong background in linear algebra, group theory, and graph theory to fully understand. It may be of interest to researchers in these fields or advanced students looking for a challenging problem in mathematics.

 This text describes recent studies on heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the anticipated continuation of these studies in the coming years. The authors compare fragmentation functions for two colliding systems and find that no significant modifications are observed within the uncertainties using current jet finding algorithms and background subtraction procedures. However, this conclusion depends on assumptions about Pythia fragmentation and could be affected by bias induced by analysis cuts.  The text also discusses the importance of exploring the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase diagram, which is believed to contain a number of phase boundaries, including one separating QGP partonic degrees of freedom from ordinary matter. The authors mention that lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) predicts a smooth cross-over transition in the zero-baryon chemical potential limit but a first-order transition at higher values. A critical point (CP) is expected to mark the location where the QGP phase transition changes from a cross-over to a first-order transition.  The authors mention that Star, an experiment at RHIC, will engage in a beam energy scan program to locate the CP and investigate the evolution of medium properties indicative of non-hadronic matter. They also discuss the potential impact of fluctuations on various physical parameters and suggest that previous experimental results might already provide hints regarding the CP location.  The text mentions recent achievements in Star, such as successful injection and collisions of Au ions at 7 TeV and the collection of first low energy collisions, which yielded data for identified hadron spectra, azimuthal anisotropy measurements, and pion interferometry. The authors look forward to new data in upcoming runs to further explore the QCD phase diagram and pinpoint the location of the critical point.  The text also mentions ongoing correlation analyses from Star experiment, including studies on ridge properties from triggered and non-triggered correlation studies. The authors suggest that large baryon to meson ratios and the uniformity of ridge yield in @xmath15-@xmath15 space on an event-by-event basis are indicative of the bulk matter being the ridge origin. They also mention potential for full jet reconstruction in heavy ion collisions and future possibilities for more differential analyses with top energy data for Au+Au collisions.  The text cites several references, including works by Adams et al., Rafelski and Müller, Timmins, Xu et al., Ackermann, Romatschke and Romatschke, Tang, and Abelev et al.

 In June 2015, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) resumed its physics program with proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of @xmath4 = 13 tev, which is currently the highest energy reached in the laboratory. The measurement of light flavor particle production in pp collisions provides important input for event generators to model soft parton interactions and hadronization processes. However, perturbative quantum chromodynamics cannot fully describe particle production in pp collisions, so modelling efforts typically employ various empirical components that need to be adjusted based on experimental data.  The ALICE collaboration identified particles such as pions (@xmath5), kaons (@xmath6), protons (@xmath7), and various mesons using several particle identification (PID) techniques in different detectors: the inner tracking system (ITS), time projection chamber (TPC), time of flight detector (TOF), and high momentum particle identification detector (HMPID). The combined information from these detectors allows measuring particle production in the region starting from 150 mev/_c _ up to 20 GeV.  The @xmath9 and @xmath10 meson production was also measured in pp collisions at @xmath4 = 13 tev. The integrated ratios of strange and multi-strange particles to pions are shown in Figure [ratios_resonances]. However, no energy evolution is observed in the range from RHIC to the highest LHC energy.  The @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath21 and @xmath16 ratios is the same at LHC energies within systematic errors. Pythia 8 describes the shape but exhibits large deviations from the data for transverse momenta larger than 2 gev/_c_. Above @xmath22 900 gev, the @xmath21 and @xmath16 ratios are energy independent within systematic uncertainties. The relative production of strange resonances (@xmath19 and @xmath20) remains constant within a wide range of center-of-mass energy.  Multiplicity dependent studies in pp collisions at 13 tev will help disentangle the role of collision energy and event multiplicity in identified particle production.

 This text describes a study of solar filament eruptions and their associated magnetic helicity. The authors found that in most active region filament eruptions, the helicity of the surrounding field dominates over that of the filament itself. However, they identified some exceptions where quiescent filaments exhibited opposite helicity signs between the filament and the surrounding field. The authors suggest that this may be due to the fact that quiescent filaments have more well-developed barb systems than active region filaments.  The text also discusses an event from September 1999, where an erupting filament showed a change in direction from eastward to westward after the eruption. The authors suggest that this may be due to the emergence of new flux near the filament channel, which triggers the eruption. They also note that the helicity is concentrated in the surrounding field rather than within the filament itself and that for stability, the amount of axial flux must be small compared to the total flux holding down the filament.  The text includes several figures and mentions the EIT (Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope), MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager), SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory), BBSO/NJIT (Balloon-borne Big Bear Solar Observatory), and Hα (hydrogen alpha) images. The authors acknowledge the contributions of various teams and individuals, as well as funding from NASA and the Office of Naval Research.

 This text describes the electronic and optical properties of a graphene-triphenylene (G-TPP) compound. The text mentions that there is resonance between certain transitions in the TPP molecule and the graphene bands, leading to an increase in emission from the corresponding complexes. The figure provided shows the electronic band structure and density of states for this compound.  The text explains that pristine graphene has a zero-gap semiconductor property, but when TPP is stacked on it, there is a charge transfer from TPP to graphene, resulting in a doping mechanism. The optical absorption properties of G-TPP are discussed, with strong absorptions observed at around 1.57 and 1.96 eV for the TPP bands. These peaks show a redshift compared to those of isolated TPP due to the strong stacking interaction.  The text also discusses the theoretical investigation of TPP physisorption on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene, with findings suggesting that diameter is the relevant parameter for strong TPP physisorption rather than chirality. The results indicate very strong stacking interactions between TPP and SWCNTs or graphene but not enough to open an energy gap in functionalized graphene.  The text concludes by suggesting that both G-TPP and TPP-SWCNT exhibit remarkable stability while preserving the absorption properties of the chromophore, which may be of interest for light-harvesting and bio-labeling applications.

 This text describes a method for extracting cellular signals from raw data by removing background and optimizing model parameters. The method involves several components, including updating the basis functions and rank of the background approximation, manually verifying and deleting low-quality neurons, adding new neurons, optimizing model parameters, and using fast algorithms such as hierarchical alternating least squares (HALS) for initialization and background fitting.  The method is designed to improve the extraction of cellular signals by adaptively changing the basis functions and rank of the background approximation based on trends in the data. Manual intervention steps allow users to verify and delete low-quality neurons, which can improve signal qualities of nearby neurons. Adding new neurons involves selecting a pixel with the maximum residual and running a rank-1 non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in a small window centered at that pixel.  The text also compares this method to PCA-ICA methods, noting that manual intervention steps and removing false positive neurons can significantly improve signal extraction for other neurons. The optimization approach involves iteratively updating the model parameters by solving two optimization problems. The first problem updates the spatial components given the estimates of the previous iteration, while the second problem updates the temporal components column by column.  The method is designed to be fast and scalable, with initializations taking only a few minutes on a single desktop for large datasets, and background fitting requiring only seconds. Manual interventions can be processed in real-time, and the results of the initialization step are close to the final solutions, requiring only a small number of cnmf iterations to update model parameters. The text also suggests optimizing computations using GPU and distributed computing for large datasets.
