 The text appears to be discussing the results of an analysis of sunspot data, specifically looking for periodicities in sunspot area fluctuations during the maximum activity period of solar cycle 16. The authors used wavelet analysis and autocorrelation functions to investigate the existence of a periodicity around 155 days. They found that the dispersion of points related to this periodicity was large, making it difficult to confirm its existence. They also compared the autocorrelation functions and periodograms of sunspot area fluctuations from each solar hemisphere separately during the maximum activity period. The results suggested that there might be a statistically significant positive peak in the interval of 155-165 days for the southern hemisphere, but the resolution of the periodogram was not sufficient to make a definitive conclusion. The authors also noted that power spectrum analysis alone may not be sufficient to detect true periodicities and suggested using both correlative and power spectrum analyses together. Overall, the text indicates that further research is needed to confirm the existence and significance of the 155-day periodicity in sunspot data.

 This text appears to be a scientific research paper on the topic of nuclear physics, specifically focusing on the calculation of decay half-lives for alpha decays in atomic nuclei and the penetration of potential barriers. The authors have developed a new analytical formula based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to calculate the barrier penetrability, taking into account the influence of the long-range Coulomb tail in the barrier potential.  The text includes a comparison of the results obtained using different approaches, including the parabolic approximation and the WKB approach, for various isotopes of Po (polonium). The authors have assumed the barrier potential to be spherical for most cases, and they have shown that their new formula gives very good results for these spherical nuclei.  The text also discusses the importance of evaluating the integral in the equation for the penetrability and provides an analytical expression for it. The computation was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation, the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China, the Knowledge Innovation Project of CAS, and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Overall, the text presents a new analytical formula for calculating barrier penetrability in nuclear physics, which could be useful for studying barrier penetrability where one has to introduce an energy-dependent one-dimensional potential barrier or a barrier distribution function.

 This text discusses the comparison of various numerical integrators for computing molecular dynamics steps in the Schwinger model using the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. The authors consider a 122x122 lattice with coupling constant xmath123 and mass xmath124, taking parameters from [xcite] to simulate near the scaling limit with light fermions and increase the impact of the fermion part of the action. They use one thermalized gauge configuration and generate independent sets of momenta for each integrator and step size. The absolute error and statistical error are computed for each integrator and value of the step size. The micro step size is chosen to be 1/10 times smaller than the macro step size.  Figure [fig:1] compares the numerical integrators in terms of their absolute error versus the step size, showing that multi-rate schemes, RKF45 and RKF85, outperform their standard versions as expected. The adaptive nested force-gradient method has the best accuracy, while figure [fig:2] presents the CPU time required for each integrator versus the achieved accuracy. The nested force-gradient method and adapted nested force-gradient method show better computational efficiency than the other integrators.  Table [tab:1] shows the number of inversions of the Dirac operator needed to reach a 90% acceptance rate of the HMC algorithm, with @xmath121 being the most computationally demanding part. The adapted nested force-gradient method and nested force-gradient method require the least number of inversions per trajectory to reach the chosen acceptance rate.  The authors conclude that nested force-gradient schemes are an optimal choice for relatively high convergence order and low computational effort, and suggest further improvements by measuring Poisson brackets of the shadow Hamiltonian and tuning optimal parameters. In future work, they plan to apply this approach to the HMC algorithm for numerical integration in lattice QCD, expecting the adapted nested-force gradient scheme to outperform the original one with more partitioning of the action using techniques to factorize the fermion determinant.

 This paper discusses methods for deriving functional equations for Feynman integrals, specifically focusing on vacuum type integrals and integrals with external momenta. The authors introduce new methods that are simple and do not rely on integration by parts techniques. They also demonstrate that integrals with many kinematic arguments can be reduced to a combination of simpler integrals with fewer arguments.  The paper presents two methods for deriving functional equations: one based on recurrence relations, and the other using algebraic relations between products of propagators. The authors note that it is not yet clear whether functional equations derived from recurrence relations can be reproduced by the methods of algebraic relations between products of propagators.  The paper includes specific examples of functional equations for vacuum type integrals and integrals with external momenta, and discusses their implications for one-loop integrals with four, five, and six external legs, as well as some two- and three-loop Feynman integrals. The work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) within the collaborative research center 676 _ Particle, Strings and the Early Universe: The Structure of Matter and Space-Time_.  The authors express their gratitude to O.L. Veretin for providing results for integrals contributing to ortho-positronium lifetime described in ref.[xcite].

 This text appears to be discussing the use of the Hough transform in the search for gravitational waves, specifically in the context of periodic sources. The authors compare the efficiency and effectiveness of using a frequency Hough transform versus a sky Hough transform in terms of amplitude loss and computing cost. They find that the ratio of amplitude efficiencies is 1.317, which leads to a gain in computing cost for the same sensitivity. They also note the importance of adaptivity in the procedure and its applicability to situations where the source position is known but only the frequency needs to be estimated. The authors are also working on studying the efficiency of this method in terms of rejecting spurious lines in the peakmap.  The text includes several references to previous works on the Hough transform search for gravitational waves, including papers by Sintes et al., Astone et al., and Palomba et al. These papers discuss various aspects of the Hough transform search, such as its implementation, sensitivity evaluation, and application to Virgo data. The text also mentions a paper on "incoherent strategies for the network detection of periodic gravitational waves" by Palomba and Frasca, which may be relevant to the current discussion as well.

 This text is a scientific review discussing the progress made in identifying the progenitors of certain types of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) using pre-explosion images. The author discusses five different types of CCSNe and provides an update on the current understanding of their progenitor stars based on observational data.  Type II-Plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are the best-studied category, with eight putative progenitor detections and 12 upper luminosity limits established. The evidence suggests that red supergiants (RSGs) are the immediate progenitors of SNe II-P. However, an intriguing result is that all but one of the detected SNe II-P have initial masses constrained to be below 30 solar masses, which is surprising since RSGs up to 32 solar masses are observed in the local group. This lack of massive RSG progenitors leads researchers to speculate that these massive RSG progenitors may be forming black holes heralded by faint or non-existent SN explosions.  Type II-Linear supernovae (SNe II-L) are a rare type, with only one known example (SN 1980k), and no pre-explosion images exist for most of them. The analysis of the stellar population of SN 1979c by @xcite determines a mass range of 34 solar masses for its progenitor, but firm conclusions about the progenitors cannot be made yet.  Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) have one known example (SN 2005gl) with a very massive progenitor that exploded while in the luminous blue variable (LBV) phase, but it is unclear if this is indicative of the class as a whole.  Type IIB supernovae have pre-explosion images for two events: SN 1993j in M81 and SN 2008ax. The analysis of SN 1993j suggests that a 35 solar mass star exploded in a binary system, with a slightly less massive secondary surviving the explosion. The recent discovery of pre-explosion HST/WFPC2 images for SN 2008ax provides an opportunity to further investigate this rare class of CCSNe.  Type Ib/c supernovae have ten upper limits but no detections from analysis of pre-SN images, which is surprising since it is commonly thought that at least some of their progenitors should be luminous, single W-R stars. However, it is unlikely that all SNe Ib/c come from them based on current data.  The author concludes by discussing the future directions of research in this field and the exciting prospects for discoveries at the extremes of mass ranges, as well as the role of binarity in these conclusions. The review provides a comprehensive update on the current state of research on CCSN progenitor identification using pre-explosion images.

 This text appears to be a proof of a theorem in statistics, specifically about the Kingman coalescent in the context of the exchangeable coalescent process. The proof uses the rate function and the large deviation principle. The theorem states that the number of particles in the exchangeable coalescent process converges almost surely to a certain random variable as the number of particles goes to infinity. The text also mentions Lemma [l : wn] which is used in the proof but its statement is not provided.  The proof starts by defining some notation and setting up the problem. It then uses the fact that the minimum of a function is attained at its global minimum to prove a certain assertion. The rate function is shown to be of a specific form using integration by parts and the distribution function of the one-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution.  The text then shows that the expected value of a certain term is positive, which is necessary for the proof. This is done by analyzing the behavior of the term as t goes to infinity and using the fact that the probability of an event related to a random variable is non-negative.  Finally, the theorem is proven using Lemma [l : wn] and the strong law of large numbers. The text concludes by acknowledging the contributions of other researchers and the funding sources for the research.

 This text describes the study of multi-component solitary waves in quasiperiodic quasi-phase matching (QPM) gratings using numerical simulations. The grating function varies according to the Fibonacci sequence, and its Fourier spectrum is composed of sums and differences of the basic wavenumbers, which fill the whole Fourier space densely due to their incommensurability.  The authors analyze the propagation and second harmonic generation (SHG) in the quasiperiodic QPM grating by going beyond the averaged equations to consider the rapid large-amplitude variations of the envelope functions. They find that for weak input beams, both beams eventually diffract, but when the amplitude of the input beam exceeds a certain threshold, self-focusing and localization are observed for both harmonics. The resulting two-component soliton is quasiperiodic by itself and oscillates in phase with the QPM grating modulation.  The authors also investigate the transition between the linear (diffraction) and nonlinear (self-trapping) regimes by simulating the transmission coefficients and beam widths at the output of the crystal versus the intensity of the fundamental harmonic input beam for various phase mismatch values. They find that a quasiperiodic soliton is generated only for sufficiently high amplitudes, illustrating the universality of localized mode generation for varying strength of nonlinearity in quasiperiodic waves.  The text also mentions several other examples of multi-component solitary waves in nonlinear optical fibers and waveguides, including multi-wavelength solitary waves in multi-channel bit-parallel wavelength fiber transmission systems, multi-color parametric spatial solitary waves due to multistep cascading in quadratic materials, and quasiperiodic envelope solitons in Fibonacci optical superlattices. These examples reveal some general features and properties of multi-component solitary waves in nonintegrable nonlinear models and serve as a stepping stone for approaching other problems of multi-mode soliton coupling and interaction.
