        "abstract": "Terms like \"Science of Cyber\" or \"Cyber Science\" have been appearing in\nliterature with growing frequency, and influential organizations initiated\nresearch initiatives toward developing such a science even though it is not\nclearly defined. We propose to define the domain of the science of cyber\nsecurity by noting the most salient artifact within cyber security -- malicious\nsoftware -- and defining the domain as comprised of phenomena that involve\nmalicious software (as well as legitimate software and protocols used\nmaliciously) used to compel a computing device or a network of computing\ndevices to perform actions desired by the perpetrator of malicious software\n(the attacker) and generally contrary to the intent (the policy) of the\nlegitimate owner or operator (the defender) of the computing device(s). We\nfurther define the science of cyber security as the study of relations --\npreferably expressed as theoretically-grounded models -- between attributes,\nstructures and dynamics of: violations of cyber security policy; the network of\ncomputing devices under attack; the defenders' tools and techniques; and the\nattackers' tools and techniques where malicious software plays the central\nrole. We offer a simple formalism of these key objects within cyber science and\nsystematically derive a classification of primary problem classes within cyber\nscience.",

Several approaches mix artificial intelligence and\nsymbolic methods and tools deployed over large corpora to create what is known\nas cognitive systems. Cognitive computing focuses on building systems that\ninteract with humans naturally by reasoning, aiming at learning at scale.\n  The purpose of SCSS is to promote research on theoretical and practical\naspects of symbolic computation in software science, combined with modern\nartificial intelligence techniques. These proceedings contain the keynote paper\nby Bruno Buchberger and ten contributed papers. Besides, the conference program\nincluded three invited talks, nine short and work-in-progress papers, and a\nspecial session on computer algebra and computational logic. Due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the symposium was held completely online.

        "abstract": "Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated the ability to perform a variety of natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks zero-shot -- i.e., without adaptation on downstream data. Recently,\nthe debut of ChatGPT has drawn a great deal of attention from the natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) community due to the fact that it can generate\nhigh-quality responses to human input and self-correct previous mistakes based\non subsequent conversations. However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can\nserve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this\nwork, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by\nevaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task\ncategories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that\nChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g.,\narithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific\ntasks such as sequence tagging. We additionally provide in-depth analysis\nthrough qualitative case studies.",

        "abstract": "Web3 is the most hyped concept from 2020 to date, greatly motivating the\nprosperity of the Internet of Value and Metaverse. However, no solid evidence\nstipulates the exact definition, criterion, or standard in the sense of such a\nbuzzword. To fill the gap, we aim to clarify the term in this work. We narrow\ndown the connotation of Web3 by separating it from high-level controversy\nargues and, instead, focusing on its protocol, architecture, and evaluation\nfrom the perspective of blockchain fields. Specifically, we have identified all\npotential architectural design types and evaluated each of them by employing\nthe scenario-based architecture evaluation method. The evaluation shows that\nexisting applications are neither secure nor adoptable as claimed. Meanwhile,\nwe also discuss opportunities and challenges surrounding the Web3 space and\nanswer several prevailing questions from communities. A primary result is that\nWeb3 still relies on traditional internet infrastructure, not as independent as\nadvocated. This report, as of June 2022, provides the first strict research on\nWeb3 in the view of blockchain. We hope that this work would provide a guide\nfor the development of future Web3 services.",

        "abstract": "Web3Recommend is a decentralized Social Recommender System implementation\nthat enables Web3 Platforms on Android to generate recommendations that balance\ntrust and relevance. Generating recommendations in decentralized networks is a\nnon-trivial problem because these networks lack a global perspective due to the\nabsence of a central authority. Further, decentralized networks are prone to\nSybil Attacks in which a single malicious user can generate multiple fake or\nSybil identities. Web3Recommend relies on a novel graph-based content\nrecommendation design inspired by GraphJet, a recommendation system used in\nTwitter enhanced with MeritRank, a decentralized reputation scheme that\nprovides Sybil-resistance to the system. By adding MeritRank's decay parameters\nto the vanilla Social Recommender Systems' personalized SALSA graph algorithm,\nwe can provide theoretical guarantees against Sybil Attacks in the generated\nrecommendations. Similar to GraphJet, we focus on generating real-time\nrecommendations by only acting on recent interactions in the social network,\nallowing us to cater temporally contextual recommendations while keeping a\ntight bound on the memory usage in resource-constrained devices, allowing for a\nseamless user experience. As a proof-of-concept, we integrate our system with\nMusicDAO, an open-source Web3 music-sharing platform, to generate personalized,\nreal-time recommendations. Thus, we provide the first Sybil-resistant Social\nRecommender System, allowing real-time recommendations beyond classic\nuser-based collaborative filtering. The system is also rigorously tested with\nextensive unit and integration tests. Further, our experiments demonstrate the\ntrust-relevance balance of recommendations against multiple adversarial\nstrategies in a test network generated using data from real music platforms.",

With edge servers that have cloud-level computing power,\nedge intelligence can extend the capabilities of AGI to mobile edge networks.\nHowever, compared with cloud data centers, resource-limited edge servers can\nonly cache and execute a small number of PFMs, which typically consist of\nbillions of parameters and require intensive computing power and GPU memory\nduring inference. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a joint\nfoundation model caching and inference framework that aims to balance the\ntradeoff among inference latency, accuracy, and resource consumption by\nmanaging cached PFMs and user requests efficiently during the provisioning of\ngenerative AI services. Specifically, considering the in-context learning\nability of PFMs, a new metric named the Age of Context (AoC), is proposed to\nmodel the freshness and relevance between examples in past demonstrations and\ncurrent service requests. Based on the AoC, we propose a least context caching\nalgorithm to manage cached PFMs at edge servers with historical prompts and\ninference results.

        "abstract": "Cloud computing has recently evolved as a popular computing infrastructure\nfor many applications. Scientific computing, which was mainly hosted in private\nclusters and grids, has started to migrate development and deployment to the\npublic cloud environment. eScience as a service becomes an emerging and\npromising direction for science computing. We review recent efforts in\ndeveloping and deploying scientific computing applications in the cloud. In\nparticular, we introduce a taxonomy specifically designed for scientific\ncomputing in the cloud, and further review the taxonomy with four major kinds\nof science applications, including life sciences, physics sciences, social and\nhumanities sciences, and climate and earth sciences. Our major finding is that,\ndespite existing efforts in developing cloud-based eScience, eScience still has\na long way to go to fully unlock the power of cloud computing paradigm.\nTherefore, we present the challenges and opportunities in the future\ndevelopment of cloud-based eScience services, and call for collaborations and\ninnovations from both the scientific and computer system communities to address\nthose challenges.",

However, directing GAI towards desired outputs still suffer\nthe inherent instability of the AI model. In this paper, we design a novel\nframework that utilizes wireless perception to guide GAI (WiPe-GAI) for\nproviding digital content generation service, i.e., AI-generated content\n(AIGC), in resource-constrained mobile edge networks. Specifically, we first\npropose a new sequential multi-scale perception (SMSP) algorithm to predict\nuser skeleton based on the channel state information (CSI) extracted from\nwireless signals. This prediction then guides GAI to provide users with AIGC,\nsuch as virtual character generation.

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) refers to the use of AI to\nautomate the information creation process while fulfilling the personalized\nrequirements of users. However, due to the instability of AIGC models, e.g.,\nthe stochastic nature of diffusion models, the quality and accuracy of the\ngenerated content can vary significantly. In wireless edge networks, the\ntransmission of incorrectly generated content may unnecessarily consume network\nresources. Thus, a dynamic AIGC service provider (ASP) selection scheme is\nrequired to enable users to connect to the most suited ASP, improving the\nusers' satisfaction and quality of generated content. In this article, we first\nreview the AIGC techniques and their applications in wireless networks. We then\npresent the AIGC-as-a-service (AaaS) concept and discuss the challenges in\ndeploying AaaS at the edge networks. Yet, it is essential to have performance\nmetrics to evaluate the accuracy of AIGC services. Thus, we introduce several\nimage-based perceived quality evaluation metrics. Then, we propose a general\nand effective model to illustrate the relationship between computational\nresources and user-perceived quality evaluation metrics. To achieve efficient\nAaaS and maximize the quality of generated content in wireless edge networks,\nwe propose a deep reinforcement learning-enabled algorithm for optimal ASP\nselection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a\nhigher quality of generated content to users and achieve fewer crashed tasks by\ncomparing with four benchmarks, i.e., overloading-avoidance, random,\nround-robin policies, and the upper-bound schemes.",

However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious\nshortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be\naddressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component\nof any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many\nways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the\nlimitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel\nconsensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these\nalgorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain\nperforms the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus\nalgorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on\nthe properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain\nconsensus algorithms in terms of their scopes. This article fills this gap by\nanalysing a wide range of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy\nof properties and by examining the implications of different issues still\nprevalent in consensus algorithms in detail. The result of the analysis is\npresented in tabular formats, which provides a visual illustration of these\nalgorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed more than hundred top\ncrypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to\nunderstand their properties and to implicate different trends in these\ncrypto-currencies.

        "abstract": "Generative AI applications have been recently catering to a vast user base by\ncreating diverse and high-quality AI-generated content (AIGC). With the\nproliferation of mobile devices and rapid growth of mobile traffic, providing\nubiquitous access to high-quality AIGC services via wireless communication\nnetworks is becoming the future direction. However, it is challenging to\nprovide qualified AIGC services in wireless networks with unstable channels,\nlimited bandwidth resources, and unevenly distributed computational resources.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose a semantic communication\n(SemCom)-empowered AIGC (SemAIGC) generation and transmission framework, where\nonly semantic information of the content rather than all the binary bits should\nbe generated and transmitted by using SemCom. Specifically, SemAIGC integrates\ndiffusion models within the semantic encoder and decoder to design a\nworkload-adjustable transceiver thereby allowing adjustment of computational\nresource utilization in edge and local. In addition, a Resource-aware wOrk lOad\nTrade-off (ROOT) scheme is devised to intelligently make workload adaptation\ndecisions for the transceiver, thus efficiently generating, transmitting, and\nfine-tuning content as per dynamic wireless channel conditions and service\nrequirements. Simulations verify the superiority of our proposed SemAIGC\nframework in terms of latency and content quality compared to conventional\napproaches.",

The Internet is constantly evolving. Web2 focused\non companies that provide services in exchange for personal user data. Web3\ncommits to user-centricity using decentralization and zero-server\narchitectures. The current digital society demands a global change to empower\ncitizens and take back control. Citizens are locked into big-tech for personal\ndata storage and their for-profit digital identity. Protection of data has\nproven to be essential, especially due to increased home Internet traffic\nduring the COVID pandemic. Citizens do not possess their own travel documents.\nThe European Commission aims to transition this governmental property towards\nself-sovereign identity, introducing many new opportunities. Citizens are\nlocked into banks with non-portable IBAN accounts and unsustainable legacy\nbanking infrastructures. Migration to all-digital low-fraud infrastructures and\nhealthier competitive ecosystems is essential. The overall challenge is to\nreturn the power to citizens and users again. The transition to a more\ndecentralized Internet is the first crucial step in the realization of\nuser-centricity. This thesis presents the first exploratory study that\nintegrates governmental-issued travel documents into a (decentralized) societal\ninfrastructure.

        "abstract": "Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant\nattention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in\nrelated resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind\nits impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI)\ntechniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content\n(AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music,\nand natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the\ncontent creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the\nproduction of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by\nextracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by\nhuman, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent\ninformation. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly\nimportant in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved\ngeneration results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the\ndistribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to\nreality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This\nsurvey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and\nbasic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and\nmultimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the\ngeneration tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of\nmultimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities\nmentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future\nchallenges in AIGC.",

AIGenerated Content (AIGC) emerges\nas a key solution, yet the resource intensive nature of large Generative AI\n(GAI) models presents challenges. To address this issue, we introduce an\nAIGC-as-a-Service (AaaS) architecture, which deploys AIGC models in wireless\nedge networks to ensure broad AIGC services accessibility for Metaverse users.\nNonetheless, an important aspect of providing personalized user experiences\nrequires carefully selecting AIGC Service Providers (ASPs) capable of\neffectively executing user tasks, which is complicated by environmental\nuncertainty and variability. Addressing this gap in current research, we\nintroduce the AI-Generated Optimal Decision (AGOD) algorithm, a diffusion\nmodel-based approach for generating the optimal ASP selection decisions.\nIntegrating AGOD with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), we develop the Deep\nDiffusion Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm, enhancing the efficiency and\neffectiveness of ASP selection. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nD2SAC outperforms seven leading DRL algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed AGOD\nalgorithm has the potential for extension to various optimization problems in\nwireless networks, positioning it as a promising approach for future research\non AIGC-driven services.

        "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) is expected to be a core paradigm in future\ncommunication networks, yielding significant benefits in terms of spectrum\nresource saving and information interaction efficiency. However, the existing\nSemCom structure is limited by the lack of context-reasoning ability and\nbackground knowledge provisioning, which, therefore, motivates us to seek the\npotential of incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI)\ntechnologies with SemCom. Recognizing GAI's powerful capability in automating\nand creating valuable, diverse, and personalized multimodal content, this\narticle first highlights the principal characteristics of the combination of\nGAI and SemCom along with their pertinent benefits and challenges.
