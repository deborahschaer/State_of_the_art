        "abstract": "General world models represent a crucial pathway toward achieving Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications\nranging from virtual environments to decision-making systems. Recently, the\nemergence of the Sora model has attained significant attention due to its\nremarkable simulation capabilities, which exhibits an incipient comprehension\nof physical laws. In this survey, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of\nthe latest advancements in world models. Our analysis navigates through the\nforefront of generative methodologies in video generation, where world models\nstand as pivotal constructs facilitating the synthesis of highly realistic\nvisual content. Additionally, we scrutinize the burgeoning field of\nautonomous-driving world models, meticulously delineating their indispensable\nrole in reshaping transportation and urban mobility. Furthermore, we delve into\nthe intricacies inherent in world models deployed within autonomous agents,\nshedding light on their profound significance in enabling intelligent\ninteractions within dynamic environmental contexts. At last, we examine\nchallenges and limitations of world models, and discuss their potential future\ndirections.

Unlike recent\nlanguage representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep\nbidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on\nboth left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT\nmodel can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create\nstate-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering\nand language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture\nmodifications.\n  BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.

Here we\nmake two contributions to help eliminate this downside: First, we present new\nparameterizations of diffusion models that provide increased stability when\nusing few sampling steps. Second, we present a method to distill a trained\ndeterministic diffusion sampler, using many steps, into a new diffusion model\nthat takes half as many sampling steps. We then keep progressively applying\nthis distillation procedure to our model, halving the number of required\nsampling steps each time. On standard image generation benchmarks like\nCIFAR-10, ImageNet, and LSUN, we start out with state-of-the-art samplers\ntaking as many as 8192 steps, and are able to distill down to models taking as\nfew as 4 steps without losing much perceptual quality; achieving, for example,\na FID of 3.0 on CIFAR-10 in 4 steps.

However, existing works are limited in\nindependent generation of each OD pair, i.e., flow of people from one region to\nanother, overlooking the relations within the overall network.

To overcome the learning difficulty of the OD networks covering over\nthousands of regions, we decompose the original one-shot generative modeling of\nthe diffusion model into two cascaded stages, corresponding to the generation\nof network topology and the weights of edges, respectively.

To alleviate the problem, we propose\na spatial-temporal consistent diffusion framework DrivingDiffusion, to generate\nrealistic multi-view videos controlled by 3D layout. There are three challenges\nwhen synthesizing multi-view videos given a 3D layout: How to keep 1)\ncross-view consistency and 2) cross-frame consistency? 3) How to guarantee the\nquality of the generated instances?

We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that\nsamples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact\nlikelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we\nprovide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as\ndemonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image\ninpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural\nimprovements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image\ngeneration on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a\ncompetitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity\ngeneration of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based\ngenerative model.",

Existing motion planners predominantly\nleverage heuristic methods to forecast driving trajectories, yet these\napproaches demonstrate insufficient generalization capabilities in the face of\nnovel and unseen driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach\nto motion planning that capitalizes on the strong reasoning capabilities and\ngeneralization potential inherent to Large Language Models (LLMs).

Furthermore, we propose a novel\nprompting-reasoning-finetuning strategy to stimulate the numerical reasoning\npotential of the LLM. With this strategy, the LLM can describe highly precise\ntrajectory coordinates and also its internal decision-making process in natural\nlanguage.

In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable\nlane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities\nand self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we\nreformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem,\nprocessing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language\nprompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs\nspecifically for lane change prediction task.

In our\napproach, we learn an action-value function and we add a term maximizing\naction-values into the training loss of the conditional diffusion model, which\nresults in a loss that seeks optimal actions that are near the behavior policy.\nWe show the expressiveness of the diffusion model-based policy, and the\ncoupling of the behavior cloning and policy improvement under the diffusion\nmodel both contribute to the outstanding performance of Diffusion-QL. We\nillustrate the superiority of our method compared to prior works in a simple 2D\nbandit example with a multimodal behavior policy. We then show that our method\ncan achieve state-of-the-art performance on the majority of the D4RL benchmark\ntasks.",

        "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is an essential component in autonomous driving,\nparticularly for collision avoidance systems. Considering the inherent\nuncertainty of the task, numerous studies have utilized generative models to\nproduce multiple plausible future trajectories for each agent. However, most of\nthem suffer from restricted representation ability or unstable training issues.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose utilizing the diffusion model to\ngenerate the distribution of future trajectories. Two cruxes are to be settled\nto realize such an idea. First, the diversity of intention is intertwined with\nthe uncertain surroundings, making the true distribution hard to parameterize.\nSecond, the diffusion process is time-consuming during the inference phase,\nrendering it unrealistic to implement in a real-time driving system. We propose\nan Intention-aware denoising Diffusion Model (IDM), which tackles the above two\nproblems. We decouple the original uncertainty into intention uncertainty and\naction uncertainty and model them with two dependent diffusion processes. To\ndecrease the inference time, we reduce the variable dimensions in the\nintention-aware diffusion process and restrict the initial distribution of the\naction-aware diffusion process, which leads to fewer diffusion steps. To\nvalidate our approach, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Drone Dataset\n(SDD) and ETH/UCY dataset. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results, with\nan FDE of 13.83 pixels on the SDD dataset and 0.36 meters on the ETH/UCY\ndataset.

However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain\nlimited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of\ntrajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this\nissue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to\nexpand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate\ntrajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations\nfor their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure\nthat the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of\nroad-related information.

        "abstract": "World models have demonstrated superiority in autonomous driving,\nparticularly in the generation of multi-view driving videos. However,\nsignificant challenges still exist in generating customized driving videos. In\nthis paper, we propose DriveDreamer-2, which builds upon the framework of\nDriveDreamer and incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate\nuser-defined driving videos. Specifically, an LLM interface is initially\nincorporated to convert a user's query into agent trajectories. Subsequently, a\nHDMap, adhering to traffic regulations, is generated based on the trajectories.\nUltimately, we propose the Unified Multi-View Model to enhance temporal and\nspatial coherence in the generated driving videos. DriveDreamer-2 is the first\nworld model to generate customized driving videos, it can generate uncommon\ndriving videos (e.g., vehicles abruptly cut in) in a user-friendly manner.\nBesides, experimental results demonstrate that the generated videos enhance the\ntraining of driving perception methods (e.g., 3D detection and tracking).\nFurthermore, video generation quality of DriveDreamer-2 surpasses other\nstate-of-the-art methods, showcasing FID and FVD scores of 11.2 and 55.7,\nrepresenting relative improvements of 30% and 50%.",

Our\nbenchmark overcomes these limitations by introducing a large-scale driving\ndataset, lightweight closed-loop simulator, and motion-planning-specific\nmetrics.

Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties.\nRecently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models,\nhave been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods\ntypically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time\nseries, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic\nlearning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion\nframework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns\ninherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier\nrepresentation of future time series, transforming the learning process into\nthe spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our\napproach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier\ninput, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models.\nCompared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on\npoint estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future\nuncertainties.
