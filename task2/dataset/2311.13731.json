        "abstract": "To non-experts, the traditional Centralized Finance (CeFi) ecosystem may seem\nobscure, because users are typically not aware of the underlying rules or\nagreements of financial assets and products. Decentralized Finance (DeFi),\nhowever, is making its debut as an ecosystem claiming to offer transparency and\ncontrol, which are partially attributable to the underlying integrity-protected\nblockchain, as well as currently higher financial asset yields than CeFi. Yet,\nthe boundaries between CeFi and DeFi may not be always so clear cut.\n  In this work, we systematically analyze the differences between CeFi and\nDeFi, covering legal, economic, security, privacy and market manipulation. We\nprovide a structured methodology to differentiate between a CeFi and a DeFi\nservice. Our findings show that certain DeFi assets (such as USDC or USDT\nstablecoins) do not necessarily classify as DeFi assets, and may endanger the\neconomic security of intertwined DeFi protocols. We conclude this work with the\nexploration of possible synergies between CeFi and DeFi.",

        "abstract": "Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant\nattention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in\nrelated resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind\nits impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI)\ntechniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content\n(AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music,\nand natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the\ncontent creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the\nproduction of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by\nextracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by\nhuman, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent\ninformation. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly\nimportant in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved\ngeneration results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the\ndistribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to\nreality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This\nsurvey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and\nbasic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and\nmultimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the\ngeneration tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of\nmultimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities\nmentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future\nchallenges in AIGC.",

Recently, researchers presented the edge AIGC paradigm,\neffectively optimize the service latency by distributing AIGC services to edge\ndevices. However, AIGC products are still unprotected and vulnerable to\ntampering and plagiarization. Moreover, as a kind of online non-fungible\ndigital property, the free circulation of AIGC products is hindered by the lack\nof trustworthiness in open networks. In this article, for the first time, we\npresent a blockchain-empowered framework to manage the lifecycle of edge AIGC\nproducts. Specifically, leveraging fraud proof, we first propose a protocol to\nprotect the ownership and copyright of AIGC, called Proof-of-AIGC. Then, we\ndesign an incentive mechanism to guarantee the legitimate and timely executions\nof the funds-AIGC ownership exchanges among anonymous users. Furthermore, we\nbuild a multi-weight subjective logic-based reputation scheme, with which AIGC\nproducers can determine which edge service provider is trustworthy and reliable\nto handle their services.

        "abstract": "As ChatGPT goes viral, generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a AI-generated content) has\nmade headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text,\nimages, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost\nimpossible for us to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle.\nIn the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth\nnoting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool\nout of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many\npeople are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants)\nhelp ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? Toward\nanswering this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is\nneeded. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first\nlook at AIGC, ranging from its techniques to applications. Modern generative AI\nrelies on various technical foundations, ranging from model architecture and\nself-supervised pretraining to generative modeling methods (like GAN and\ndiffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work\nfocuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their\noutput type, including text, images, videos, 3D content, etc., which depicts\nthe full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their\nsignificant applications in some mainstream industries, such as education and\ncreativity content.
