While most of the research efforts in this domain are focused on detecting high-quality deepfake images and videos, only a few works address the problem of the localization of small segments of audio-visual manipulations embedded in real videos. In this research, we emulate the process of such content generation and propose the AV-Deepfake1M dataset. The dataset contains content- driven (i) video manipulations, (ii) audio manipulations, and (iii)\\n\\naudio-visual manipulations for more than 2K subjects resulting in a total of more than 1M videos. The paper provides a thorough description of the proposed data generation pipeline accompanied by a rigorous analysis of the quality of the generated data. The comprehensive benchmark of the proposed dataset utilizing state- of-the-art deepfake detection and localization methods indicates a significant drop in performance compared to previous datasets. The proposed dataset will play a vital role in building the next-generation deepfake localization methods.

Consequently, discriminating between real and fake content is becoming increasingly more challenging even for humans [41, 77]. This opens the door for misuse of content generation technology for example to spread misinformation and commit fraud, rendering the development of reliable detection methods vital.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nWe propose AV-Deepfake1M, a large content-driven audio- visual dataset for the task of temporal deepfake localization. ‚Ä¢ We propose an elaborate data generation pipeline employing novel manipulation strategies and incorporating the state-of- the-art in text, video and audio generation.\\n\\nWe perform comprehensive analysis and benchmark of the proposed dataset utilizing state-of-the-art deepfake detection and localization methods.\\n\\nThe development of such methods is highly dependent on the available deepfake benchmark datasets, which led to the steady in- crease in the number of publicly available datasets that provide examples of visual-only [28, 35, 38], audio-only [39, 71], and audio- visual [31] content modification strategies (e.g., face-swapping, face- reenactment, etc.). However, the majority of these datasets and meth- ods assume that the entirety of the content (i.e., audio, visual, audio- visual) is either real or fake. This leaves the door open for criminals to exploit the embedding of small segments of manipulations in the otherwise real content. As argued in [6], this type of targeted ma- nipulation can lead to drastic changes in the underlying meaning as illustrated in Figure 1. Given that most deepfake benchmark datasets do not include this type of partial manipulations, detection methods might fail to perform reliably on this new type of deepfake content. This work addresses this gap by releasing a new large-scale audio- visual dataset called AV-Deepfake1M specifically designed for the task of temporal deepfake localization. To improve the realism and quality of generated content, the proposed data generation pipeline incorporates the ChatGPT1 large language model. The pipeline fur- ther utilizes the latest open-source state-of-the-art methods for high- quality audio [8, 33] and video [62] generation. The scale and novel modification strategies position the proposed dataset as the most comprehensive audio-visual benchmark as illustrated in Figure 1, making it an important asset for building the next generation of deepfake localization methods. The main contributions are,\\n\\n1https://chat.openai.com/\\n\\n2 RELATED WORK The performance of any deepfake detection method is highly de- pendent on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the datasets used for development [18, 21, 25, 40, 44, 47, 49, 51, 52, 61, 63, 69, 72, 75]. Over the past few years, many datasets (e.g., [22, 34, 41]) have been proposed to support the research on deepfake detection. A comprehensive list of the relevant publicly available datasets is given in Table 1. Most of the available datasets provide examples of face manipulations through either face swapping [16, 34, 77] or face reenactment [31, 35] techniques. In terms of the number of samples, earlier datasets are smaller due to the limited availability of face ma- nipulation techniques. With the rapid advancements in content gen- eration technology, several large-scale datasets such as DFDC [16], DeeperForensics [28], KoDF [35], and DF-Platter [41] have been proposed. However, the task associated with these datasets is mainly restricted to coarse-level deepfake detection. Until this point manip- ulations are mainly applied only to the visual modality, and later, audio manipulations [39] and audio-visual manipulations [31] have been proposed to increase the complexity of the task.\\n\\nIn 2022, LAV-DF [6] was introduced to become the first content- driven deepfake dataset for temporal localization. However, the qual- ity and scale of LAV-DF are limited, and the state-of-the-art methods designed for temporal localization [4, 75] are already achieving very strong performance. AV-Deepfake1M addresses these gaps by improving the quality, diversity, and scale of the previous datasets de- signed for temporal deepfake localization. Given that LAV-DF is the only available public dataset that has been designed for the same task\\n\\nAV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset\\n\\nMM ‚Äô24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\\n\\nAudio GenerationTTS OptionsTranscript ManipulationVideo Generation\\n\\nFake Frames Fake Audio\\n\\nInsertDelete\\n\\nReplace\\n\\nReal AudioFake Speech Word \\x00Raw Output)Fake SpeechFake VideoReal VideoFake AudioFake FramesFake Frames Fake AudioFake Frames Bg NoiseFake Speech Full SentenceSpeechCollectFinetuneStrip zero signalsLoudness normAll Speech of the SubjectBg NoiseReal TextText ManipulationsGenerateReal FramesRef Pose\\n\\nOption 1Option 1\\x00 Generate Full Sentence then CropOption 2\\x00 Generate the New Word OnlyFind and cropSampleCrop noise to the same lengthAddOption 2\\n\\nYou are a helpful text modifier.

Given a real video, the pre-processing consists of audio extraction via FFmpeg followed by Whisper-based transcript generation. In the first stage, transcript manipulation, the original transcript is modified through word-level insertions, deletions, and replacements. In the second stage, audio generation, based on the relevant transcript manipulation, the audio is generated in both speaker-dependent and independent fashion. In the final stage, video generation, based on the generated audio, the subject-dependant video is generated with smooth transitions in terms of lip-synchronization, pose, and other relevant attributes.\\n\\nas the dataset proposed in this paper, next we do a direct comparison of the two datasets. In addition to the fact that AV-Deepfake1M is significantly larger than LAV-DF, in terms of the number of subjects, and amount of real and fake videos, the following differences further highlight our contributions.\\n\\nLAV-DF uses a rule-based system to find antonyms that max- imize the change in sentiment in the transcript manipulation step. We argue that naively choosing the antonyms causes context inconsistencies and low diversity of the fake con- tent. AV-Deepfake1M addresses this issue with the use of a large language model, which results in diverse and context- consistent fake content.\\n\\nThe output quality of the visual generator Wav2Lip [46] and audio generator SV2TTS [27] used for generating LAV-DF is not sufficient for state-of-the-art detection methods. AV- Deepfake1M utilizes the latest open-source state-of-the-art methods for high-quality audio and video generation.\\n\\nLAV-DF includes only replacement as a manipulation strat- egy.

Manipulation Strategy. The first stage for generating content-driven deepfakes is transcript manipulation. We utilize ChatGPT for altering the real transcripts. Through LangChain [9] the output of ChatGPT is a structured JSON with four fields: 1) operation: This set contains replace, delete, and insert, which has been applied on the input; 2) old_word: The word in the input to replace or delete; 3) new_word: The word in the input to insert or replace; 4) index: The location of the operation in the input. The number of transcript modifications depends on the video length and is determined by the following equation ùëÄ = ceil(ùë°/10) where ùëÄ is the number of modifications and ùë° (sec) is the length of the video. We followed [3] and built a few-shot prompt template for ChatGPT.\\n\\nTable 2: Audio quality of AV-Deepfake1M.

Figure 3 (a) illustrates a comparison of the frequencies of the top 20 words in AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF [6]. The results show that few words in LAV-DF have dominant frequencies (>10%), whereas this issue is drastically reduced in AV-Deepfake1M. Ow- ing to the contribution of ChatGPT, we also observed a significant increase in unique new words (>27.7√ó) in the modified transcripts compared to LAV-DF, Figure 3 (b). This statistical comparison shows that the proposed LLM-based transcript manipulation strategy gen- erates more diverse content compared to the rule-based strategy employed in LAV-DF. We further elaborate on the advantages of using an LLM in this step in the supplementary material.\\n\\nAudio generation is slightly different for each of the manipu- lation strategies (i.e., replace, insert and delete). In the case of replace and insert, we need to generate new audio correspond- ing to new_word(s). Generally, there are two ways to generate the new_word(s): 1) Generate audio for the final fake transcript and crop it to get the audio for the required new_word(s) and 2) Generate audio only for the new_word(s). To bring further diver- sity and challenge, we use both strategies to generate audio for the new_word(s). In the case of delete, only the background noise is retained. After the audio manipulation, we normalized the loudness of the fake audio segments to the original audio to add more realism. To keep the consistency with the environmental noise, we add the background noise previously separated to the final audio output. Analysis. We evaluated the quality of the audio generation following previous works [7, 11] (note that for all datasets, we only evaluated the samples where the audio modality is modified). The results are shown in Table 2. The first evaluation metric is speaker encoder co- sine similarity (SECS) [60]. It measures the similarity of the speakers given a pair of audio in the range [‚àí1, 1]. We also calculated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all fake audio and Fr√©chet audio dis- tance (FAD) [32]. The results indicate that AV-Deepfake1M contains higher quality audio compared to other datasets.\\n\\n3.1.2 Audio Generation. Manipulation Strategy. The next stage is to generate high-quality audio with the same style as the speaker. The audio is first separated into background noise and speech using Denoiser [17]. Zero-shot voice cloning methods such as SV2TTS [27] utilized by previous datasets [6, 31] have low signal-to-noise ratio resulting in low-quality audio manipulations that are easily localized by BA-TFD [4] and UMMAFormer [75]. To increase the quality of the generated audio, we employ the identity-dependent text-to-speech method VITS [33]\\n\\n3.1.3 Video Generation. Manipulation Strategy. The final stage of the generation pipeline is visual content generation. After the audio is generated, the lip- synced visual frames are generated based on the subjects‚Äô original pose and the fake audio. We investigated several face reenactment strategies including EAMM [26], AVFR-GAN [2], DiffTalk [54], AD-NeRF [20] and ATVGnet [10] and concluded that these methods are not well suited for zero-shot lip-synced generation of unseen speakers. Thus, we use TalkLip [62] for visual content generation\\n\\nAV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset\\n\\nMM ‚Äô24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\\n\\nVITS 171,600 (100%)\\n\\nW (12.1%)F (40.0%)W (2.4%)F (45.5%)\\n\\nVITS-Word (23.6%)VITS-Full(76.4%)\\n\\nYourTTS 13,791 (47.9%)\\n\\n(a) #Subjects(b) #Videos(c) #Videos in Train(d) #Videos in Val(e) #Videos in Test\\n\\nVITS 15,010 (52.1%)W (12.1%)F (40.3%)W (2.3%)F (45.3%)Val 54,730 (4.8%)\\n\\nTrain & Val 1,657 (80.1%)Test 411 (19.9%)Test 343,240 (29.9%)YourTTS 177,581\\n\\nTrain 746,180 (65.1%)VITS 195,336 (52.4%)\\n\\nFigure 4: Data partitioning in AV-Deepfake1M.

We first randomly select 1,657 subjects for the train set and 411 subjects for the test set without overlap. The validation set is randomly selected from the train set. The test set contains only samples with VITS- based identity-dependent audio. The variation in the number of subjects and videos in the sets is presented in Table 4 and Figure 4. Figure 5 illustrates the direct comparison of AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF. The results indicate that AV-Deepfake1M is more diverse in terms of modifications, subjects, fake segment and video lengths, and a lower average proportion of fake segments, making the dataset a vital asset for building better deepfake localization methods.\\n\\nMM ‚Äô24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\\n\\nTable 4: Number of subjects and videos in AV-Deepfake1M.\\n\\nSubset\\n\\n#Subjects\\n\\n#Real Videos\\n\\n#Fake Videos\\n\\n#Videos\\n\\nTrain Validation Test Overall\\n\\n1,657\\n\\n411 2,068\\n\\n186,666 14,235 85,820 286,721\\n\\n559,514 43,105 257,420 860,039\\n\\n746,180 54,730 343,240 1,146,760\\n\\nTable 5: User study results for AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF.\\n\\nUser Study\\n\\nAcc.

Each participant was asked to classify 20 videos (5 real and 5 fake from LAV-DF dataset, 5 real and 5 fake from AV-Deepfake1M) as real or fake and propose the potential fake segment start and end point. The user study results presented in Table 5 indicate that the deepfake content in AV-Deepfake1M is very challenging to detect for humans, and AV-Deepfake1M is more difficult than LAV-DF.\\n\\n3.4 Computational Cost We spent around ‚àº600 GPU hours for speech recognition with Whis- per [48], ‚àº2100 GPU hours for training VITS [33] (each of the 721 VITS models requires ‚àº3hrs), and ‚àº300 GPU hours for data generation. Overall, we needed ‚àº3000 GPU hours to generate AV- Deepfake1M with NVIDIA RTX6000 GPUs.\\n\\n4 BENCHMARKS AND METRICS This section outlines the benchmark protocol for AV-Deepfake1M along with the used evaluation metrics. The goal is to detect and lo- calize content-driven audio, visual, and audio-visual manipulations.\\n\\n4.1 Data Partitioning The dataset is organized in train, validation, and test sets, as de- scribed in Section 3.2. The original test set (all modifications) is referred to as fullset in the rest of the text. For a fair comparison with visual-only and audio-only methods, we also prepared subset V (by excluding the videos with audio-only modifications from fullset) and subset A (by excluding the videos with visual-only modifications from fullset).\\n\\n4.2 For benchmarking temporal deepfake localization, we consider the following state-of-the-art methods: Pyannote [45] is a pre-trained speaker diarization method. TriDet [55] and ActionFormer [73] are the state-of-the-art in the temporal action localization domain. Since\\n\\nImplementation Details\\n\\n2All procedures in this study were conducted in accordance with Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee approval 41545.\\n\\nCai et al.\\n\\nthese two methods require pre-trained features, we extracted the state-of-the-art features VideoMAEv2 [64] and InternVideo [65] for benchmarking. BA-TFD [6], BA-TFD+ [4], and UMMAFormer [75] are the state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for audio- visual temporal deepfake localization. We followed the original settings for BA-TFD and BA-TFD+. For UMMAFormer [75], we implemented it using the InternVideo [65] visual features and BYOL- A [43] audio features. For image-based classification methods, we consider Meso4 [1], MesoInception4 [1], Xception [12], Face X- Ray [36], LipForensics [21], EfficientViT [15], and SBI [56]. We followed the procedure used in previous works [4, 76] to aggregate the frame-level predictions to segments for localization.\\n\\nFor benchmarking deepfake detection, we trained the image-based models Meso4 [1], MesoInception4 [1], Xception [12] and Effi- cientViT [15] with video frames along with the corresponding labels. For the segment-based methods MDS [13] and MARLIN [5], we used a sliding window to sample segments from the video for training and inference. During the inference stage, the frame- and segment- level predictions are aggregated to video-level by max voting. The aggregation strategy is discussed in Section 5. We also evaluated the zero-shot performance of several methods, including the LLM-based Video-LLaMA [74], audio pre-trained CLAP [68], M2TR [63] and LipForensics [21] pre-trained on FF++ [50], Face X-Ray [36] and SBI [56] pretrained on blending images. For Video-LLaMA, we also evaluated 5 model ensembles (the majority vote of 5 model inferences). To investigate the impact of the level of label access, we designed 3 different label access levels for training: frame-level labels, segment-level labels only, and video-level labels only.\\n\\n4.3 Evaluation Metrics Temporal Deepfake Localization. We use average precision (AP) and average recall (AR) as prior works [6, 22]. Deepfake Detection. We use standard evaluation protocol [16, 50] to report video-level accuracy (Acc.) and area under the curve (AUC).\\n\\n5 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS This section reports the performance of the state-of-the-art deepfake detection and localization methods described in Section 4.2 on AV- Deepfake1M. The reported performance is based on different subsets, described in Section 4.1, and different levels of label access during training, described in Section 4.2.\\n\\n5.1 Audio-Visual Temporal Deepfake Localization The results of this benchmark are depicted in Table 6. All state-of-the- art methods achieve significantly lower performance compared to the performance reported on previous datasets [6, 22]. This significant drop indicates that existing temporal deepfake localization methods are falling behind with the rapid advancements in content generation. In other words, we can claim that the highly realistic fake content in AV-Deepfake1M will open an avenue for further research on temporal deepfake localization methods.\\n\\n5.2 Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection Similarly to temporal deepfake localization, the results of the clas- sical deepfake detection benchmark are summarized in Table 7.\\n\\nAV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset\\n\\nMM ‚Äô24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\\n\\nTable 6: Temporal deepfake localization benchmark.

Providing the fine-grained segment-level and frame-level labels dur- ing training brings an improvement in performance. However, even with the frame-level labels provided during training, the AUC of the best-performing methods is less than 70, due to the multimodal modifications present in AV-Deepfake1M.\\n\\nThe frame- and segment-based deepfake detection methods can only produce frame- and segment-level predictions. Thus, a suitable aggregation strategy is required to generate the video-level predic- tions. We investigated several popular aggregation strategies, such as max (e.g., [6]), average (e.g., [15, 23, 63]), and the average of the highest 5 scores (e.g., [37]) for video-level predictions. The results of the experiment are presented in Table 9. The results show that max is the optimal aggregation strategy on AV-Deepfake1M for the considered deepfake detection methods.\\n\\n5.4 Benchmark Comparison We conducted additional experiments (Tables 8 and 10) to compare the performance on temporal localization and classification on AV- Deepfake1M and LAV-DF [6].\\n\\nThere is a significant drop in BA-TFD [6] temporal localization performance as compared to LAV-DF (Table 8). A similar pattern is also observed for BA-TFD+ [4] (AP@0.5 96.30 ‚Üí 44.42) and UMMAFormer [75] (AP@0.5 98.83 ‚Üí 51.64). For classification (Table 10), the performance of Xception [12], LipForensics [21], Face X-Ray [36], and SBI [56] also drops compared to LAV-DF. These additional results further validate that AV-Deepfake1M is more challenging than LAV-DF.\\n\\nWe conduct the experiments using Xception and BA-TFD pre- trained on AV-Deepfake1M then finetune and evaluate on LAV-DF, shown in Table 11. We observe the performance improvements are significant for both temporal localization with BA-TFD and clas- sification with Xception, when compared with models trained on LAV-DF from scratch.\\n\\n5.3 Unimodal Deepfake Detection and Localization We also evaluated the performance on subset V and subset A, as described in Section 4.1. As expected, all visual-only methods con- sistently perform better on subset V compared to fullset for both temporal localization and detection. The same holds for subset A and audio-only methods.\\n\\n6 CONCLUSION This paper presents AV-Deepfake1M, the largest audio-visual dataset for temporal deepfake localization.

Limitations. Similarly to other deepfake datasets, AV-Deepfake1M exhibits a misbalance in terms of the number of fake and real videos. Broader Impact. Owing to the diversified and realistic, content- driven fake videos, AV-Deepfake1M will support the development of robust audio-visual deepfake detection and localization models. Ethics Statement. We acknowledge that AV-Deepfake1M may raise ethical concerns such as the potential misuse of facial videos of celebrities, and even the data generation pipeline could have a poten- tial negative impact. Misuse could include the creation of deepfake videos or other forms of exploitation. To avoid such issues, we have taken several measures such as distributing the data with a proper end-user license agreement, where we will impose certain restric- tions on the usage of the data, such as the data generation technology and resulting content being restricted to research purposes only.\\n\\nAV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset\\n\\nREFERENCES [1] Darius Afchar, Vincent Nozick, Junichi Yamagishi, and Isao Echizen. 2018.

(d) The new words after the rule- based manipulations in LAV-DF.\\n\\nA TRANSCRIPT MANIPULATION In addition to the quantitative comparison of transcript modifications in AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF [6] (see Section 3.1.1), here we also present a qualitative one. Figure 6 illustrates word clouds for old_word(s) and new_word(s) for both datasets. A comparison between the new words generated by the rule-based strategy utilized in LAV-DF and our LLM-driven generation further demonstrates that the latter results in more natural and diverse transcript manipulations.\\n\\nB HUMAN QUALITY ASSESSMENT Here we provide further details on the user study (see Section 3.3) that aims to evaluate humans‚Äô performance in detecting the highly realistic deepfake content in AV-Deepfake1M.\\n\\nB.1 Data The data used in the user study are 200 videos randomly sampled from the test set of AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF [6], with the aim to maximize the number of unique identities. Please note that the user study setup ensures each participant cannot see a duplicated identity. The videos include 50 real videos from AV-Deepfake1M, 50 fake videos from AV-Deepfake1M, 50 real videos from LAV-DF, and 50 fake videos from LAV-DF. For fair comparison with LAV- DF, the fake videos contain only one audio-visual replacement (see Section 3).\\n\\nB.2 Participants We randomly group the participants into 10 groups where each group evaluates 10% of the videos (i.e., 20 videos including 5 real videos\\n\\nFigure 7: Screenshot of the user study interface. On the top is the video with audio, the middle is the textual description of the task, and the bottom is the participant‚Äôs controls to 1) Select whether the video is real or fake and 2) If the participant selects fake, use a slider to specify the begin and end of the fake segment.\\n\\nfrom AV-Deepfake1M, 5 fake videos from AV-Deepfake1M, 5 real videos from LAV-DF, and 5 fake videos from LAV-DF). We utilize a random non-overlapping selection of videos for each participant, meaning that each participant evaluates videos for 20 out of the 200 videos. After watching each video, the participants first answer whether the video is real or fake, and if they think the video is fake, the participants can choose the start and end timestamps for the fake segment. A screenshot of the developed user study interface based on the React3 framework is shown in Figure 7.\\n\\nB.3 Evaluation and Analysis Among the 25 participants that took part in the user study, the bi- nary deepfake detection/classification accuracy is 64.84% for AV- Deepfake1M. This low performance indicates that the deepfake content in AV-Deepfake1M is very challenging for humans to de- tect. A similar pattern is observed for the temporal localization of fake segments. Similarly to Table 5, here we report and compare average precision (AP) and average recall (AR) scores in Table 12 and extend that comparison with the state-of-the-art methods using the same subset of videos. The AP score for 0.5 IoU is 01.92. Thus, we reduced the AP threshold to 0.1 IoU, improving the AP score to 15.32. Figure 8 illustrates a similar qualitative comparison. The low human performance in each aspect indicates that to detect highly realistic deepfake content, we need more sophisticated detection and localization methods.\\n\\n3https://react.dev/\\n\\nMM ‚Äô24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\\n\\nCai et al.\\n\\nGTHuman 1Human 2Human 3EffecientViTBA-TFDBA-TFD+UMMAFormer\\n\\nGTHuman 1Human 2Human 3EffecientViTBA-TFDBA-TFD+UMMAFormer\\n\\nGTHuman 1Human 2Human 3EffecientViTBA-TFDBA-TFD+UMMAFormer\\n\\nGTHuman 1Human 2Human 3EffecientViTBA-TFDBA-TFD+UMMAFormer\\n\\nGTHuman 1Human 2Human 3EffecientViTBA-TFDBA-TFD+UMMAFormer\\n\\nGTHuman 1Human 2Human 3EffecientViTBA-TFDBA-TFD+UMMAFormer\\n\\nGTHuman 1Human 2Human 3EffecientViTBA-TFDBA-TFD+UMMAFormer\\n\\nGTHuman 1Human 2Human 3EffecientViTBA-TFDBA-TFD+UMMAFormer\\n\\nFigure 8: Examples of user study results and comparison with the state-in-the-art in temporal deepfake localization.

Comparing the human performance between AV- Deepfake1M (Acc. 68.64, AP@0.1 15.32) and LAV-DF (Acc. 84.03, AP@0.1 36.80), we find that AV-Deepfake1M is more challenging than LAV-DF for humans.\\n\\nC AUDIO AND VIDEO GENERATION Here we provide complete details on the manipulations in AV- Deepfake1M (see Section 3). Figure 9 provides visualizations corre- sponding to each of the three modifications and the resulting deep- fake content. Please note that for example for Fake Audio and Real Visual in the cases of deletion and insertion, there are slight modifi- cations in the visual signal as well.

      "\n",
      "Deepfake speech detection has emerged as an active research topic due to the increasing prevalence of deepfake audio in various domains, including entertainment, politics, and cybersecurity. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in deepfake speech detection, highlighting key differences across various types of deepfakes, competitions, datasets, features, classifications, and evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Types of Deepfake Speech\n",
      "Deepfake speech can be categorized into three main types: text-to-speech (TTS) deepfakes, voice conversion (VC) deepfakes, and speaker embedding (SE) deepfakes [1]. TTS deepfakes generate synthetic speech from text using neural networks. VC deepfakes modify the voice of a source speaker to resemble that of a target speaker. SE deepfakes manipulate the speaker's identity by embedding their voice into a different speaker's audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Competitions and Datasets\n",
      "Several competitions have been organized to evaluate deepfake speech detection models, including ASVspoof 2019 [2], ADD 2023 [3], and In-the-Wild [4]. ASVspoof 2019 focused on detecting TTS and VC deepfakes in conversational scenarios. ADD 2023 aimed to evaluate the performance of models on various types of deepfakes, including TTS, VC, and SE, in real-world conditions. In-the-Wild focused on detecting deepfakes in real-world audio recordings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Datasets like Wavefake [5], LRPD [6], and VoxCeleb2 [7] have been used to train and evaluate deepfake speech detection models. Wavefake provides a large collection of TTS and VC deepfakes, while LRPD offers a dataset of real-world audio recordings with corresponding speaker embeddings. VoxCeleb2 is a comprehensive dataset for speaker recognition, which can be used as a source of clean, authentic speech data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Features and Classifications\n",
      "Various features have been proposed for deepfake speech detection, including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) [8], spectral subband centroid (SSC) [9], perceptual linear prediction (PLP) [10], and deep neural networks (DNNs) [11]. MFCCs are widely used in speech processing due to their ability to capture the spectral envelope of speech signals. SSC features represent the centroid of each subband, providing information about the distribution of energy within each subband. PLP features model the long-term prediction error between an input signal and a reference signal. DNNs can learn complex representations of speech data from large datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Classifiers used for deepfake speech detection include support vector machines (SVMs) [12], random forests (RFs) [13], and deep neural networks (DNNs) [14]. SVMs are effective in separating linearly separable classes, while RFs can handle non-linear relationships between features. DNNs can learn complex decision boundaries from large datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Evaluation\n",
      "Performance metrics for deepfake speech detection include accuracy, false acceptance rate (FAR), and false rejection rate (FRR) [15]. Accuracy measures the overall performance of a model, while FAR and FRR provide information about the number of false positives and false negatives, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Challenges and Future Work\n",
      "Deepfake speech detection faces several challenges, including the lack of large, diverse datasets for training models, the need to adapt to real-world communication platform conditions, and the potential for adversarial attacks on deepfake detection models [16]. To address these issues and enhance the robustness of our deepfake audio detection models for real-time communication platforms, we propose the following strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3.1. Training Data Variability\n",
      "To account for real-world communication nuances, augmenting the ASVspoof 2019 dataset with additional conversational, noisy, and fragmented speech data is an essential first step [17]. Incorporating datasets like Spotify podcast collection [18], FoR [19], WaveFake [5], LRPD [6], In-the-wild [4], and VoxCeleb2 [7] can introduce more diverse acoustic scenarios, enhancing the model's adaptability to real-world communication platform conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3.2. Data Augmentation\n",
      "Data augmentation techniques, such as adding noise, changing pitch, and applying time stretching, can be used to generate additional training data from existing datasets [20]. These techniques can help improve the robustness of deepfake speech detection models by introducing variations in the training data that may not be present in the original dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3.3. Adversarial Attacks\n",
      "Adversarial attacks on deepfake speech detection models can be used to evaluate their robustness and identify potential vulnerabilities [21]. Developing techniques for detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks on deepfake speech detection models is crucial for ensuring the security of real-time communication platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3.4. Real-Time Processing\n",
      "Real-time processing of deepfake speech detection models is essential for their practical application in various domains, including cybersecurity and entertainment [22]. Developing efficient algorithms and hardware architectures for real-time deepfake speech detection is an important area of research.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, deepfake speech detection has emerged as a critical research area due to the increasing prevalence of deepfakes in various domains. Understanding the challenges and opportunities associated with deepfake speech detection requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines expertise from signal processing, machine learning, and cybersecurity. By addressing these challenges through innovative research and development, we can ensure the security and integrity of real-time communication platforms in an increasingly complex digital world.\n"

      " Title: Recent Developments in Deepfake Speech Detection: A Comprehensive Survey with Critical Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Deepfake technology, which allows generating synthetic media that can mimic human voices, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications and malicious uses. Deepfake speech detection has emerged as a critical research area to combat the spread of deepfake audio content, especially in areas such as digital forensics, cybersecurity, and multimedia processing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of recent developments in deepfake speech detection, focusing on the methodologies, techniques, and challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it is essential to understand the basics of deepfake speech generation. Deepfake speech is created by training generative models such as WaveNet or Tacotron2 on large datasets of real speech recordings. These models learn to generate new speech samples that are similar to the original data but can be manipulated to produce fake speech. The primary goal of deepfake speech detection is to distinguish between real and fake speech, which can be a challenging task due to the high degree of similarity between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent research in deepfake speech detection has focused on various approaches, including feature-based methods, machine learning models, and deep learning techniques. One of the earliest works in this area was by Lim et al. (2022), who proposed using explainable deep learning techniques to detect deepfake voice. They used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from speech signals and employed a decision tree classifier for classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach is the use of machine learning models, such as support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Chen et al. (2020) proposed a generalization framework for audio deepfake detection using SVMs. They extracted features from speech signals using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and used SVMs for classification. Mcuba et al. (2023) employed ANNs to detect deepfake audio, while Conti et al. (2022) proposed a semantic approach based on emotion recognition for deepfake speech detection using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep learning techniques have also gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to learn complex representations from data. Blue et al. (2022) proposed a method for detecting audio deepfakes through vocal tract reconstruction using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Chen et al. (2022) introduced an audio deepfake detection system with neural stitching, which uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to detect deepfake speech. Yang and Das (2018, 2020) proposed using long-term high frequency features for synthetic speech detection using wavelet transforms and continuous wavelet transforms, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress made in deepfake speech detection, several challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics. The availability of large, diverse, and annotated datasets is crucial for developing effective deepfake speech detection models. Tao et al. (2023) introduced the second audio deepfake detection challenge to address this issue by providing a benchmark dataset and evaluation metrics for deepfake speech detection research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge is the need for real-time processing and low computational complexity. Deep learning models, in particular, can be computationally expensive and require significant processing power, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop lightweight models that can provide accurate results with minimal computational overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, deepfake speech detection models must be robust against various types of attacks, such as adversarial attacks and domain shifts. Adversarial attacks involve manipulating the input data to mislead the model into making incorrect predictions. Domain shifts refer to changes in the distribution of the input data, which can affect the performance of deep learning models.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, recent developments in deepfake speech detection have shown promising results using various methodologies and techniques. However, several challenges remain, including the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, the need for real-time processing and low computational complexity, and robustness against attacks. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to develop effective deepfake speech detection models that can protect against malicious uses of deepfake technology.\n",
