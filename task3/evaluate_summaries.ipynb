Traditional evaluation metrics mainly cap-\\nturing content (e.g. n-gram) overlap between sys-\\ntem outputs and references are far from satisfactory,\\nand large language models (LLMs) such as Chat-\\nGPT have demonstrated great potential in NLG\\nevaluation in recent years. Various automatic evalu-\\nation methods based on LLMs have been proposed,\\nincluding metrics derived from LLMs, prompting\\nLLMs, and fine-tuning LLMs with labeled evalu-\\nation data. In this survey, we first give a taxon-\\nomy of LLM-based NLG evaluation methods, and\\ndiscuss their pros and cons, respectively. We also\\ndiscuss human-LLM collaboration for NLG evalu-\\nation. Lastly, we discuss several open problems in\\nthis area and point out future research directions.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nEvaluating natural language generation (NLG) is a key but\\nchallenging issue. Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU\\nand ROUGE rely on the n-gram overlap between model out-\\nputs and references to measure its quality. They have been\\ncriticized for low correlation with human judgments [Sulem\\net al., 2018], as surface-level matching cannot reliably evalu-\\nate text. After the rise of deep learning, model-based eval-\\nuation metrics like BERTScore [Zhang et al., 2020] and\\nBARTScore [Yuan et al., 2021] have been continuously pro-\\nposed and gradually adopted to evaluate the overall quality\\nor various specific aspects of generated outputs (e.g., fluency,\\ncoherence, coverage, faithfulness, etc.). Although better than\\ntraditional metrics, their performance is still not satisfactory,\\nand their application scope is very limited.\\nFor example,\\nBERTScore is reference-based and cannot be used without\\na reference. With the emergence of large language models\\n(LLMs) like ChatGPT, they have achieved unprecedented ef-\\nfectiveness in following instructions, understanding content,\\nand generating text. This inspired researchers to use LLMs\\nfor NLG evaluation. Although this is a research direction that\\nonly emerged in 2023, the past year has seen an enormous\\namount of research work. It is no exaggeration to say that\\nLLM-derived Metrics\\nEmbedding-based\\nProbability-based\\nFine-tuning\\nSpecialized\\nEvaluation LLM\\nPrompt\\nHuman\\nFine-tuning LLMs\\nHuman-LLM \\nCollaborative\\nEvaluation\\nFine-tuning LLMs\\nPrompting\\nLLMs\\nLLM\\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the four categories of LLM-\\nbased NLG evaluation.\\nNLG evaluation has been revolutionized by LLMs. This arti-\\ncle will review the existing literature and provide suggestions\\nfor future research in this field.\\nThis article mainly focuses on research that uses language\\nmodels with over one billion parameters for NLG evaluation,\\nwith necessary references to earlier model-based evaluation\\nmetrics like BERTScore. To maintain focus, other types of\\ngeneration like code generation and tasks involving images\\nare not included in the scope of this article. As shown in Fig-\\nure 1, according to how we utilize LLMs for NLG evaluation,\\nwe categorize the research work into four types:\\n• LLM-derived metrics (§2): developing/deriving evalu-\\nation metrics from embeddings or generation probabili-\\nties of LLMs.\\n• Prompting LLMs (§3):\\ndirectly inquiring existing\\nLLMs via designed prompts.\\n• Fine-tuning LLMs (§4): using labeled evaluation data\\nto fine-tune existing LLMs and improving their NLG\\nevaluation capabilities.\\n• Human-LLM Collaborative Evaluation (§5): leverag-\\ning the distinctive strengths of both human evaluators\\nand LLMs to achieve robust and nuanced evaluations\\nin challenging domains through human-LLM collabora-\\ntion.\\narXiv:2402.01383v1  [cs.CL]  2 Feb 2024\\nWe will review each type of evaluation methods and discuss\\nthe pros and cons respectively. Lastly, we will discuss future\\ndirections in this area (§6).\\n2\\nLLM-derived Metrics\\n2.1\\nOverview\\nEarly model-based NLG evaluation methods,\\nsuch as\\nBERTScore and BARTScore, were primarily motivated by\\nthe capability of traditional pre-trained language models to\\ngenerate high-quality texts. Recently, the advent of LLMs\\nhas prompted some research to adapt these ideas to stronger\\nLLMs. Their inherent, powerful linguistic abilities are de-\\nrived for direct NLG evaluation, which is expected to result\\nin better performance. Such works can be categorized into\\ntwo types: embedding-based and probability-based methods.\\n2.2\\nEmbedding-based Metrics\\nThe embedding-based methods, like BERTScore, generally\\nutilize representations of language models and thus compute\\nthe semantic similarity between the reference and the target\\ntext to evaluate, with different possible ways of implemen-\\ntation. Recent work [ES et al., 2023] similarly obtains em-\\nbeddings for the target text using the text-embedding-ada-002\\nmodel through the OpenAI API. The higher the correspond-\\ning similarity, the closer the target text aligns with the relevant\\nrequirements, indicating a higher quality.\\n2.3\\nProbability-based Metrics\\nGPTScore [Fu et al., 2023a] establishes tailored evaluation\\ntemplates for each aspect to effectively guide multiple LLMs\\nfor NLG evaluation. The generation probability is calculated\\nunder the condition of source input designed with customized\\nprompts and evaluation aspects, which endows the GPTScore\\nwith better flexibility in evaluation.\\nAnd similar methods\\nhave also been applied to the hallucination detection of the\\nLLM-generated text in recent reseach with three different at-\\ntempts for calculating the probability score.\\nOn the other hand, some works leverage the variation in\\nprobabilities under changed conditions as the evaluation met-\\nric. FFLM [Jia et al., 2023] proposes to evaluate the faith-\\nfulness of the target text by calculating a combination of\\nprobability changes based on the intuition that the genera-\\ntion probability of a given text segment increases when more\\nconsistent information is provided, and vice versa. Similarly,\\nDELTASCORE [Xie et al., 2023] measures the quality of dif-\\nferent story aspects according to the likelihood difference be-\\ntween pre- and post-perturbation states with LLMs including\\nGPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) that provide logits. They believe\\nthat the sensitivity to specific perturbations indicates the qual-\\nity of related aspects, and their experiments demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of their approach.\\n2.4\\nPros and Cons\\nTraditional NLG evaluation approaches always fall short due\\nto their surface-form similarity when the target text and ref-\\nerence convey the same meaning but use different expres-\\nsions. In contrast, LLM-derived metrics offer a remedy for\\nthe limitation and demonstrate stronger correlations with hu-\\nman judgments benefiting from the evolving modeling tech-\\nniques. However, the flaws within LLMs can lead to some\\nissues, as introduced in the following:\\nRobustness. Some research has investigated the robust-\\nness of LLM-derived metrics and found that they lack ro-\\nbustness in different attack scenarios. Specifically, [He et al.,\\n2023b] develops a set of stress tests to assess the robustness\\nof various model-based metrics on some common NLG tasks.\\nThey show a catalogue of the blind spots and potential errors\\nidentified that are not detected by each metric.\\nEfficiency. Compared to traditional metrics, LLM-derived\\nevaluation methods are more time-consuming and require\\nmore computational resources, especially when adopting\\nLLMs with quite large parameter scales.\\nTo address this,\\nsome lightweight learning approaches and fast LLM infer-\\nence and serving tools like vLLM 1 have been proposed.\\nHowever, closed-source LLMs often do not provide param-\\neters, representations, or logits, thus making it impossible to\\napply LLM-derived methods to them.\\nFairness. [Sun et al., 2022] assesses the social bias across\\nvarious metrics for NLG evaluation on six sensitive attributes:\\nrace, gender, religion, physical appearance, age, and socioe-\\nconomic status. Their findings reveal that model-based met-\\nrics carry noticeably more social bias than traditional metrics.\\nRelevant biases can be categorized into two types: intrinsic\\nbias encoded within pre-trained language models and extrin-\\nsic bias injected during the computation of similarity. There-\\nfore, current LLM-derived methods may have similar issues.\\n3\\nPrompting LLMs\\n3.1\\nOverview\\nLLMs have demonstrated unprecedented instruction under-\\nstanding and text generation abilities, which broadens re-\\nsearchers’ imagination of automatic evaluation for NLG. For\\na long time, human evaluation has been viewed as the gold\\nstandard for NLG evaluation. Recently, some studies claim\\nthat LLMs are on par with crowdsourcing annotators in sev-\\neral tasks. So, can LLMs simulate or even be an alternative to\\nhumans in the human evaluation of NLG? Or, do the practices\\nin human evaluation or other evaluative tasks (e.g. competi-\\ntion race, paper review, etc.) inspire us to better NLG evalua-\\ntion with LLMs? A large body of research and attempts based\\non prompting LLMs are guided by these ideas. In these stud-\\nies, instructions and the text to be evaluated are completely\\nexpressed in the prompt given to LLMs, and the evaluation\\nresults are generated by it.\\nHuman evaluation typically includes the following ele-\\nments:\\n• Evaluation Methods: The way the preferences of an-\\nnotators are captured and recorded, such as scoring, and\\ncomparison.\\n• Task Instructions: How the annotators should read or\\nmanipulate different parts to complete the annotation.\\n1https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\\nYou will be given a news article. You will then be given one \\nsummary written for this article. Your task is to rate the summary \\non one metric. Please make sure you read and understand these \\ninstructions carefully. \\nEvaluation Criteria:\\nConsistency (1-5) - the factual alignment between the summary and \\nthe summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only \\nstatements that are entailed by the source document. Annotators \\nwere also asked to penalize summaries that contained hallucinated \\nfacts. \\nEvaluation Steps:\\n1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main facts and \\ndetails it presents.\\n2. Read the summary and compare it to the article. Check if the \\nsummary contains any factual errors that are not supported by the \\narticle.\\n3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.\\nSource Text: \\nPaul Merson has restarted his row with Andros Townsend after the \\nTottenham midfielder was brought on with only seven minutes \\nremaining in his team\\'s 0-0 draw with Burnley on Sunday. … \\nSummary: \\nPaul Merson was brought on with only seven minutes remaining ….\\nEvaluation Form: Answer by starting with \"Rating:\" and then give \\nthe explanation of the rating on the next line by \"Rationale:\"\\n- Consistency: \\nRating: 2\\nRationale:  The summary incorrectly states that Andros Townsend ….\\nPrompt\\nResponse\\nFigure 2: An example of prompting LLMs to score summary faith-\\nfulness. It can be seen that there are task instructions, evaluation\\ncriteria, and input content in the prompt. The rating and explanation\\nare generated by LLMs.\\n• Input Content: The target text to be evaluated and\\nother required content. Other required content including\\nsource documents, references, and external knowledge\\nis provided as needed.\\n• Evaluation Criteria: Also known as aspect, the general\\ndefinition of how good or bad the text to be evaluated\\nis in a particular aspect of quality, e.g. fluency, faithful-\\nness.\\n• Role and interaction: The roles annotators play in the\\nevaluation and the interactions between them.\\nThe focus of the existing research can always be mapped\\nanalogously to one or more of these elements, and we orga-\\nnize them according to the elements they address. An exam-\\nple of prompting LLMs is shown in Figure 2.\\n3.2\\nEvaluation Methods\\n[Kocmi and Federmann, 2023b] discover GPT-3.5 and GPT-\\n4 achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy of evaluating trans-\\nlation quality compared to human labels, outperforming all\\nthe results from the metric shard task of WMT22 [Freitag et\\nal., 2022]. [Wang et al., 2023a] experiment on five datasets\\nacross summarization, story generation, and data-to-text, and\\nChatGPT evaluators with a rating scale from 1 to 5 or 1 to\\n100 have the state-of-the-art or comparative correlations with\\nhuman judgments in most settings, compared with prior met-\\nrics. Similar conclusions are also observed in open-domain\\ndialogue response generation [Lin and Chen, 2023]. Besides\\nEnglish, [Mendonc\\n¸a et al., 2023] show that ChatGPT with\\nsimple rating prompts is a strong evaluator for multilingual\\ndialogue evaluation, surpassing prior metrics based on en-\\ncoders.\\nComparison. Different from absolute scoring, compari-\\nson refers to choosing the better of the two. [Luo et al., 2023]\\nuse ChatGPT to compare the factual consistency of two sum-\\nmaries. AuPEL [Wang et al., 2023d] evaluate personalized\\ntext generation from three aspects in the form of compari-\\nson with the PaLM 2 family [Anil et al., 2023]. According\\nto [Liusie et al., 2023], pairwise comparison is better than\\nscoring when medium-sized LLMs (e.g. FlanT5 [Chung et\\nal., 2022] and Llama2 [Touvron et al., 2023]) are adopted as\\nevaluators.\\nRanking. Ranking can be viewed as an extended form of\\ncomparison. In comparison, only two examples are involved\\nat a time, whereas in ranking, the order of more than two\\nexamples needs to be decided at once. [Ji et al., 2023] use\\nChatGPT to rank five model-generated responses across sev-\\neral use cases at once, indicating the ranking preferences of\\nChatGPT align with those of humans to some degree. Simi-\\nlarly, GPTRank is a method to rank summaries in a list-wise\\nmanner [Liu et al., 2023c]. Moreover, [Liu et al., 2023b]\\ncompare different evaluation methods in LLM-based summa-\\nrization including scoring, comparison, and ranking, showing\\nthat the optimal evaluation method for each backbone LLM\\nmay vary.\\nBoolean QA. Boolean QA requires LLMs to answer ”Yes”\\nor ”No” to a question. It is adopted more in scenarios where\\nhuman annotations are binary, such as grammaticality [Hu et\\nal., 2023], faithfulness of summaries and statements [Luo et\\nal., 2023; ES et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023], factuality of gen-\\nerated text [Fu et al., 2023b], and answerability of generated\\nquestions [Wang et al., 2023f].\\nError Analysis. Error Analysis refers to the evaluation of\\na text by looking for errors that occur in the text according to a\\nset of predefined error categories. Multidimensional Quality\\nMetrics (MQM) [Jain et al., 2023] is an error analysis frame-\\nwork prevalent in machine translation evaluation. According\\nto MQM, [Kocmi and Federmann, 2023a] use ChatGPT or\\nGPT-4 to automatically detect translation quality error spans.\\nBOOOOKSCORE [Chang et al., 2023], an LLM-based eval-\\nuation metric, assesses the coherence of book summaries by\\nidentifying eight types of errors.\\n3.3\\nTask Instructions\\nIn the human evaluation of NLG, task instructions typically\\nconsist of a general task description and more detailed eval-\\nuation steps, akin to Chain-of-Thought. The demonstrations\\nused in few-shot prompting are also included in this part.\\nForm and requirements. Studies from Eval4NLP 2023\\nhave tested the effects of styles and lengths of task instruction,\\nand some have used LLMs to either generate or refine task\\ninstructions [Leiter et al., 2023]. [He et al., 2023a] evaluate\\ngenerative reasoning by asking LLMs to generate their own\\nanswers first, and then conduct a quantitative analysis of the\\ntext to be evaluated.\\nAnalysis and explanations. LLMs can include analysis or\\nexplanation in their evaluations, which is a key point that dis-\\ntinguishes them from previous automatic evaluation metrics.\\nEarly explorations into prompting LLMs for NLG evaluation\\nmostly do not examine the impact of whether LLMs are re-\\nquired to analyze and explain on evaluation result. Findings\\nsuggest that explicit analysis or explanation instructions can\\nbetter align LLM evaluations with human judgments [Chiang\\nand Lee, 2023], though the quality of LLM-generated expla-\\nnations still needs manual review.\\nDemonstrations.\\nSometimes in-context examples are\\nneeded for prompting LLMs. Some studies use only these\\nexamples even without additional instructions for prompting\\n[Jain et al., 2023], while others observe no significant ben-\\nefit from one-shot settings, compared to zero-shot settings\\n[Kotonya et al., 2023]. Iteratively updating in-context ex-\\namples has been shown to enhance LLM evaluators’ perfor-\\nmance [Hasanbeig et al., 2023].\\n3.4\\nInput Content\\nThe types of input content mainly depend on the evalua-\\ntion criteria and are relatively fixed. For most task-specific\\ncriteria, like summary faithfulness [Luo et al., 2023], both\\nthe source document and target text are needed. For task-\\nindependent criteria, such as fluency [Hu et al., 2023; Chi-\\nang and Lee, 2023], only the target text is required, though\\nthe source document is often included [Wang et al., 2023a;\\nLiusie et al., 2023]. Different tasks may require additional\\ninput types, such as providing or omitting references in ma-\\nchine translation evaluations [Kocmi and Federmann, 2023b].\\nUniquely, some studies incorporate the output of other auto-\\nmatic evaluation metrics into the input for LLMs [Shu et al.,\\n2023].\\n3.5\\nEvaluation Criteria\\nThe evaluation targeting specific aspects is used in numerous\\nstudies of human evaluation for NLG, such as text summa-\\nrization, story generation, dialogue, and text simplification.\\nEvaluation criteria, i.e., the definitions of aspects are key in\\nthis context. Most evaluation criteria in LLM-based evalua-\\ntion are directly derived from human evaluation. However, a\\nfew studies have attempted to let LLMs generate or improve\\nevaluation criteria. [Liu et al., 2023e] use a few human-rated\\nexamples as seeds to let LLMs draft some candidate evalu-\\nation criteria, and then further filter them based on the per-\\nformance of LLMs using these criteria on a validation set, to\\nobtain the final evaluation criteria. [Kim et al., 2023b] de-\\nsigned an LLM-based interactive evaluation system, which\\ninvolves using LLMs to review the evaluation criteria pro-\\nvided by users, including eliminating ambiguities in crite-\\nria, merging criteria with overlapping meanings, and decom-\\nposing overly broad criteria. Additionally, [Ye et al., 2023]\\npropose a hierarchical aspect classification system with 12\\nsubcategories, demonstrating that under the proposed fine-\\ngrained aspect definitions, human evaluation and LLM-based\\nevaluation are highly correlated. Additionally, the chain-of-\\naspects approach improves LLMs’ ability to evaluate on a\\nspecific aspect by having LLMs score on some related aspects\\nbefore generating the final score [Gong and Mao, 2023].\\n3.6\\nRole and Interaction\\nWe include in this section the evaluation strategies that ei-\\nther use the same LLMs in different ways or involve different\\nLLMs. The former can be further divided into chain-style and\\nnetwork-style interactions.\\nChain-style interaction. Inspired by human evaluators,\\n[Yuan et al., 2024] have LLMs score a batch of examples\\nto be evaluated each time. Specifically, the evaluation pro-\\ncess is divided into three stages: analysis, ranking, and scor-\\ning. Similar to QA-based evaluation metrics [Durmus et al.,\\n2020], [Fu et al., 2023b] assess the faithfulness of summaries\\nin two stages: treating LLMs as question generators to gen-\\nerate a question from the summary; then having LLMs an-\\nswer the question using the source document. Differently,\\nwhen [Hu et al., 2023] use GPT-4 to evaluate the faithfulness\\nof summaries, it first asks GPT-4 to extract event units from\\nthe summary, then verifies whether these event units meet the\\nrequirements, and finally judges whether the event units are\\nfaithful to the source document.\\nNetwork-style interaction.\\nUnlike chain-style interac-\\ntions, network-style interactions involve the dispersion and\\naggregation of information.\\nIn network-style interactions,\\nLLMs on the same layer play similar roles. ChatEval [Chan\\net al., 2023] is a framework for evaluating content through\\ndebates among multiple LLMs, with three communication\\nstrategies designed among the three types of LLMs: One-\\nBy-One, Simultaneous-Talk, and Simultaneous-Talk-with-\\nSummarizer. [Zhang et al., 2023b] find that under certain\\nconditions, widening and deepening the network of LLMs\\ncan better align its evaluation with human judgments. [Saha\\net al., 2023] propose a branch-solve-merge strategy, assign-\\ning LLMs the roles of decomposing problems, solving them,\\nand aggregating answers, thereby improving the accuracy and\\nreliability of evaluations. [Wu et al., 2023] assume that dif-\\nferent people such as politicians and the general public have\\ndifferent concerns about the quality of news summaries, use\\nLLMs to play different roles in evaluation accordingly, and\\naggregate the results finally.\\nDifferent LLMs. Different from having the same LLM\\nplay different roles, some research has used different LLMs\\n(such as GPT-4 and Claude) in their studies. In pairwise com-\\nparisons, previous work mostly used a single LLM as the\\nevaluator, which may not be fair. In light of this, [Bai et\\nal., 2023] design a decentralized Peer-examination method,\\nusing different LLMs as evaluators and then aggregating the\\nresults. Further, [Li et al., 2023c] let different LLMs serve\\nas evaluators in pairwise comparisons and then have them go\\nthrough a round of discussion to reach the final result. Addi-\\ntionally, [Cohen et al., 2023] evaluate the factuality of texts\\nthrough the interaction of two LLMs, where the LLM that\\ngenerated the text acts as the examinee and the other LLM as\\nthe examiner.\\n3.7\\nPros and Cons\\nThe benefits of prompting LLMs for NLG evaluation are ex-\\nciting. First, for the first time, people can express evaluation\\ncriteria and evaluation methods in natural language within the\\nprompts given to LLMs, providing great flexibility. Where\\npreviously people needed to design specific evaluation met-\\nrics for different NLG tasks or even different aspects of a sin-\\ngle task, now they only need to modify the prompts for LLMs.\\nSecondly, surprisingly, LLMs have the ability to generate ex-\\nplanations while assessing texts, making this approach some-\\nwhat interpretable. Furthermore, in many NLG task, prompt-\\ning LLMs for evaluation has achieved state-of-the-art corre-\\nlations with human judgments.\\nHowever, as many studies have pointed out, this type of\\napproach still has many limitations. [Wang et al., 2023b]\\nnote that when using ChatGPT and GPT-4 for pairwise com-\\nparisons, the order of the two texts can affect the evaluation\\nresults, which is known as position bias. To alleviate this\\nissue, [Li et al., 2023d] propose a strategy of splitting, align-\\ning, and then merging the two texts to be evaluated into the\\nprompt. Also, LLM evaluators tend to favor longer, more ver-\\nbose responses [Zheng et al., 2023] and responses generated\\nby themselves [Liu et al., 2023a]. [Wu and Aji, 2023] show\\nthat compared to answers that are too short or grammatically\\nincorrect, answers with factual errors are considered better by\\nLLMs. [Liu et al., 2023d] demonstrate through adversarial\\nmeta-evaluation that LLMs without references are not suit-\\nable for evaluating dialogue responses in closed-ended sce-\\nnarios: they tend to score highly on responses that conflict\\nwith the facts in the dialogue history. [Zhang et al., 2023a]\\nalso present the robustness issues of LLMs in dialogue eval-\\nuation through adversarial perturbations. [Shen et al., 2023]\\nindicate that LLM evaluators have a lower correlation with\\nhuman assessments when scoring high-quality summaries. In\\naddition, [Zhang et al., 2023a] state that evaluators based\\non large models have a bias towards high scores, especially\\nin non-Latin languages like Chinese and Japanese. Beyond\\nthese shortcomings of performance, both ChatGPT and GPT-\\n4 are proprietary models, and their opacity could lead to irre-\\nproducible evaluation results.\\n4\\nFine-tuning LLMs\\n4.1\\nOverview\\nAs mentioned above, despite the exciting performance of\\nprompting LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for NLG evalu-\\nation, several shortcomings in practice are inevitable, such\\nas high costs, possibly irreproducible results, and potential\\nbiases in LLMs. In response, recent research has shifted to-\\nwards fine-tuning smaller, open-source LLMs specifically for\\nevaluation purposes, aiming to achieve performance close to\\nGPT-4 in NLG evaluation. Representative works of this type\\ninclude PandaLM [Wang et al., 2023e], Prometheus [Kim\\net al., 2023a], Shepherd [Wang et al., 2023c], TIGERScore\\n[Jiang et al., 2023], INSTRUCTSCORE [Xu et al., 2023],\\nAuto-J [Li et al., 2023a], CritiqueLLM [Ke et al., 2023] and\\nJudgeLM [Zhu et al., 2023]. Their main ideas are similar, in-\\nvolving the elaborate construction of high-quality evaluation\\ndata, followed by accordingly fine-tuning open-source base\\nLLMs. Nevertheless, there are certain discrepancies in the de-\\nsigns across different works, such as the usage of references\\nand evaluation criteria. We have summarized the key differ-\\nent components of these methods in Table 1 for comparison,\\nwhich will be elaborated on next.\\n4.2\\nData Construction\\nDiverse data with high-quality annotations is crucial for the\\nfine-tuning of evaluation models, which mainly involves task\\nscenarios, inputs, target texts to evaluate, and evaluation re-\\nsults. Early NLG evaluation research primarily focused on\\nconventional NLG tasks, such as summarization and dialogue\\ngeneration. Thus, the task scenarios, inputs, and target texts\\nrefer to the corresponding NLP task, source inputs of the\\ntask, and outputs generated by specialized systems based on\\ntask requirements, respectively. And mainstream datasets for\\nthese tasks predominantly employ human annotators to pro-\\nvide evaluation results, which are often considered reliable.\\nWith the recent rise of LLMs, the spectrum of NLG tasks\\nhas been broadened to scenarios of instruction and response\\nthat are more aligned with human needs. Traditional tasks\\nlike summarization with corresponding source inputs can be\\nviewed as kinds of instructions and requirements.\\nMean-\\nwhile, responses generated by various general LLMs gen-\\nerally serve as the target texts now and require more flex-\\nible evaluation so that the performance of different LLMs\\ncan be compared, promoting further developments. There-\\nfore, to keep pace with the current advancement of modeling\\ntechniques, most evaluation methods have adopted the similar\\ninstruction-response scenario.\\nThe primary differences in these works actually lie in the\\nconstruction of instructions, with the purpose of improving\\neither diversity or reliability for the better generalization abil-\\nity of the fine-tuned model. PandaLM and JudgeLM entirely\\nsample from common instruction datasets, such as Alpaca\\n52K, while CritiqueLLM adopts small-scale sampling fol-\\nlowed by ChatGPT augmentation. In contrast, Prometheus\\nand INSTRUCTSCORE rely on GPT-4 to generate all the in-\\nstructions based on seed data, whereas Auto-J and Shepherd\\nuse real-world data. Moreover, since large-scale human anno-\\ntation is impractical, most works utilize GPT-4 as the power-\\nful annotator, except for PandaLM and Shepherd, which use\\nGPT-3.5 and human annotation on small-scale community\\ndata, respectively.\\nDuring the construction, they basically\\nall design detailed prompts or guidance and apply heuristic\\nfiltering strategies and post-processing methods to mitigate\\nnoise. Overall, despite the possible higher quality of human\\nannotation, the corresponding drawback is the difficulty in\\nconstructing large-scale datasets, which in turn may hinder\\nadequate model training, while using LLMs for construction\\nis the opposite situation.\\n4.3\\nEvaluation Method\\nAs with prompting LLMs, the evaluation methods adopted in\\nthese works are highly diversified, involving different evalua-\\ntion criteria, result modes, and usages of the reference. Given\\nthat current instruction-response scenarios encompass differ-\\nent types of tasks, it is unsuitable to specify unified evalu-\\nation criteria as in traditional NLG tasks. However, some\\nworks still do it this way, while some other methods let LLM\\nannotators adaptively and implicitly reflect the required cri-\\nteria in their evaluations, like PandaLM, TIGERScore, and\\nMethod\\nData Construction\\nEvaluation Method\\nBase LLM\\nReference\\nRequired\\nInstruction Source\\nAnnotator Scale\\nResult Mode\\nDetails\\nSpecific Criteria\\nPandaLM\\nAlpaca 52K\\nGPT-3.5\\n300K\\nComparison\\nReason &\\nReference\\nUnified\\nLLaMA\\n7B\\nNo\\nPrometheus\\nGPT-4 Construction\\nGPT-4\\n100K\\nScoring\\nReason\\nExplicit\\nLLaMA-2-Chat\\n7B & 13B\\nYes\\nShepherd\\nCommunity Critique Data\\n& 9 NLP Tasks Data\\nHuman\\n1317\\nOverall\\nJudgement\\nError Identifying\\n& Refinement\\nUnified\\nLLaMA\\n7B\\nNo\\nTIGERScore\\n23 Distinctive Text\\nGeneration Datasets\\nGPT-4\\n48K\\nMQM\\nError Analysis\\nImplicit\\nLLaMA-2\\n7B & 13B\\nNo\\nINSTRUCTSCORE\\nGPT-4 Construction\\nGPT-4\\n40K\\nMQM\\nError Analysis\\nImplicit\\nLLaMA\\n7B\\nYes\\nAUTO-J\\nReal-world User Queries\\nfrom Preference Datasets\\nGPT-4\\n4396\\nScoring &\\nComparison\\nReason\\nImplicit\\nLLaMA-2-Chat\\n13B\\nNo\\nCritiqueLLM\\nAlignBench &\\nChatGPT Augmentation\\nGPT-4\\n9332\\nScoring\\nReason\\nUnified\\nChatGLM-2\\n6B, 12B & 66B\\nFlexible\\nJudgeLM\\nGPT4All-LAION, ShareGPT\\nAlpaca-GPT4 & Dolly-15K\\nGPT-4\\n100K\\nScoring &\\nComparison\\nReason\\nUnified\\nVicuna\\n7B, 13B & 33B\\nFlexible\\nTable 1: Comparison of the different key components among the representative methods of fine-tuning LLMs.\\nAUTO-J. In particular, AUTO-J has meticulously crafted 332\\nevaluation criteria, matched to different tasks. Furthermore,\\nPrometheus explicitly incorporates evaluation criteria into the\\ninputs of the model, expecting flexible evaluation based on\\nvarious customized criteria.\\nMore details about the evaluation methods are shown in\\nTable 1. All the works require models to provide detailed\\ninformation, such as reasons for their evaluation results. And\\nthe MQM mode can achieve more informative error analysis,\\noffering stronger interpretability. Moreover, some works do\\nnot necessarily require references and then have greater value\\nin practice. And a more optimal method is to concurrently\\nsupport both reference-based and reference-free evaluations\\nas JudgeLM and CritiqueLLM.\\n4.4\\nFine-tuning Implementation\\nThe fine-tuning process is uniformly implemented by differ-\\nent works on their selected open-source LLMs, like LLaMA,\\nand respective constructed data, with some targeted set-\\ntings. Specifically, Prometheus maintains balanced data dis-\\ntributions during fine-tuning, including the length and label.\\nJudgeLM eliminates potential biases by randomly swapping\\nsample pairs to be compared and randomly removing ref-\\nerences. INSTRUCTSCORE utilizes GPT-4 to provide er-\\nror annotations for the intermediate outputs of the fine-tuned\\nmodel for further supervised reinforcement. Moreover, Cri-\\ntiqueLLM implements separately, with and without refer-\\nences, and explores the effects of data and model scale. Com-\\npared to the vanilla fine-tuning setting, these methods have\\nimproved the efficiency of model training and the robustness\\nof evaluations.\\n4.5\\nPros and Cons\\nThe shortcomings of prompting LLM methods can be signif-\\nicantly alleviated due to the customized implementation of\\ndata construction and fine-tuning. For instance, most fine-\\ntuned models range between 7B and 13B in the scale of pa-\\nrameters, facilitating low-cost inference use and good repro-\\nducibility, with performance close to GPT4 in NLG evalua-\\ntion. And specific measures can be adopted to prevent related\\nbiases found in GPT4 during different stages. Furthermore,\\nthis type of approach allows for continuous iteration and im-\\nprovement of the model to address potential deficiencies or\\nemerging issues discovered in future applications.\\nHowever, some biases associated with GPT4 may still per-\\nsist, as the data construction of most methods employs GPT4\\nfor critical evaluation annotation. On the other hand, the base\\nopen-source LLMs selected by existing works are primarily\\nthe series of LLaMA. With the rapid updates and improve-\\nments of open-source large models recently, it adheres to the\\nintuition that employing a more powerful base LLM should\\nlead to better evaluation performance. However, this means\\nrepetitive fine-tuning processes and computational expenses\\nsince directly migrating existing finetuned models to the new\\nbase LLM is difficult. Additionally, although many existing\\nmethods aspire for more flexible and comprehensive evalua-\\ntion through fine-tuning, demanding many evaluation settings\\nin model training may ultimately lead to poor performance,\\nwhich has been observed in our practice and also mentioned\\nrelationally in [Li et al., 2023a]. And considering the differ-\\nent evaluation settings in existing works, it is challenging to\\nconduct a horizontal comparison among them. These issues\\nrequire further exploration in future research.\\n5\\nHuman-LLM Collaborative Evaluation\\n5.1\\nOverview\\nWhile LLMs demonstrate robust evaluation capabilities, there\\nexists a need for further enhancement in terms of their relia-\\nbility, particularly in establishing a stronger correlation with\\nhuman evaluation outcomes. Although human evaluation is\\nthe gold-standard evaluation approach in NLG, it is recog-\\nnized for its associated high costs and susceptibility to sub-\\njective biases [Li et al., 2023b].\\nThe robust and compre-\\nhensive capabilities exhibited by LLMs underscore consider-\\nable potential for the development of collaborative evaluation\\nmethodologies that integrate both human and LLMs. In re-\\ncent investigations, researchers have initiated the exploration\\nof collaborative evaluation paradigms, which include tradi-\\ntional NLG evaluation methods such as scoring and explain-\\ning [Zhang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b], broader evaluation\\nmethods such as testing and debugging [Ribeiro and Lund-\\nberg, 2022], and auditing NLG models to ensure fairness\\n[Rastogi et al., 2023]. Furthermore, scholars [Saunders et\\nal., 2022] are actively engaging in efforts to address the intri-\\ncate challenge of scalable oversight through the collaboration\\nof humans and LLMs. The objective is to devise strategies\\nfor effectively evaluating models in tasks that pose inherent\\ndifficulties for human assessors. This collaborative approach\\nseeks to leverage the distinctive strengths of both human eval-\\nuators and sophisticated language models to achieve robust\\nand nuanced evaluations in challenging domains.\\n5.2\\nScoring and Explaining\\nAutomated evaluation frequently exhibits a limited correla-\\ntion with human judgments, while human evaluation, though\\nreliable, is labor-intensive. [Zhang et al., 2021] present a\\nhuman-machine collaborative framework (HMCEval) which\\nconceptualizes dialogue evaluation as a sample assignment\\nproblem to ensure the reliability of evaluation outcomes while\\nminimizing human effort and achieves 99% accuracy with\\nhalf human effort. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a cost-\\neffective alternative to human evaluations.\\nHowever, both\\nhumans and LLMs have limitations, including inherent sub-\\njectivity and unreliable judgments, especially in open-ended\\ntasks with diverse requirements.\\nTo address challenges associated with inconsistent evalua-\\ntion criteria in open-ended tasks and explore synergy between\\nhumans and LLM-based evaluators, [Li et al., 2023b] pro-\\nposes a Collaborative Evaluation pipeline (COEVAL), which\\ninvolves designing a checklist of task-specific criteria and\\nconducting detailed evaluations where LLMs generate initial\\nideation and humans engage in scrutiny. Depending solely on\\nscore predictions is insufficient for ensuring reliable evalua-\\ntion and error detection, particularly when specific criteria de-\\nmand nuanced analysis beyond straightforward scoring. CO-\\nEVAL is assigned the additional task of generating explana-\\ntions to elucidate evaluation outcomes to facilitate a trustwor-\\nthy collaborative evaluation process. Results indicate CO-\\nEVAL effectively evaluates lengthy texts by utilizing LLMs,\\nsaving significant time and reducing human evaluation out-\\nliers. Despite the involvement of LLMs, human scrutiny re-\\nmains essential, contributing to the revision of around 20% of\\nLLM evaluation scores for enhanced reliability.\\n5.3\\nBroader Evaluation Tasks\\nThe broader evaluation of NLG models involves testing and\\ndebugging the models. Current methods often rely on highly\\nvariable human creativity and extensive manual effort or are\\nlimited to addressing a very specific class of bugs. [Ribeiro\\nand Lundberg, 2022] introduce AdaTest, a process that uses\\nLLMs in collaboration with human feedback to automatically\\ngenerate unit tests that highlight bugs in a target model, which\\nproves to make users 5-10 times more effective at identifying\\nbugs and assists users in effectively fixing bugs without intro-\\nducing new ones. Moreover, LLMs have shown biases and ir-\\nresponsible behavior, necessitating thorough auditing before\\ndeployment. AdaTest++ [Rastogi et al., 2023] draw on in-\\nsights from literature on human-AI collaboration and sense-\\nmaking, and engage with research experts in safe and fair\\nAI, which emphasizes the importance of sensemaking and ef-\\nfective communication between humans and AI to capitalize\\non their complementary strengths in collaborative auditing.\\nAdaTest++ successfully leverages human strengths, such as\\nschematization and hypothesis testing. Moreover, users iden-\\ntified a range of failure modes across 26 different topics in\\nissues that were revealed in formal audits and those that were\\npreviously under-reported. Additionally, ensuring trustwor-\\nthiness in LLMs for challenging tasks poses a crucial chal-\\nlenge. Scalable oversight [Amodei et al., 2016] aims to effec-\\ntively evaluate models on tasks challenging for humans and\\nsuggests the use of AI for assistance. [Saunders et al., 2022]\\nexplored providing critiques of model outputs as a form of as-\\nsistance, demonstrating that model-generated critiques assist\\nhumans in identifying overlooked flaws.\\n5.4\\nPros and Cons\\nThe advantages of human-AI collaborative evaluation lie in\\nachieving a balance between efficiency and cost, as demon-\\nstrated by COEVAL [Li et al., 2023b] achieving this equi-\\nlibrium.\\nAdditionally, there are complementary strengths\\nbetween humans and AI. For instance, AdaTest++ [Rastogi\\net al., 2023] empowers users to consistently utilize their\\nstrengths throughout the auditing process, benefiting signif-\\nicantly from LLM. Users who generate the most topics heav-\\nily rely on LLM suggestions while employing their contextual\\nreasoning and semantic understanding to update their mental\\nmodels vigilantly and identify model failures.\\nHowever, there are drawbacks. The evaluation results of\\nLLMs may be sensitive to the formats used to query the model\\nand might require additional support for prompt writing [Li\\net al., 2023b; Rastogi et al., 2023]. Furthermore, the current\\ncapability to assess confidence levels is not strong enough,\\nmaking it challenging to determine when to trust the LLM.\\nFurthermore, certain level of human supervision is still nec-\\nessary, making it less convenient and cost-effective compared\\nto fully automated evaluation.\\n6\\nConclusions and Future Trends\\nThrough the above review of studies on NLG evaluation\\nbased on LLMs, we find that these four categories of ap-\\nproaches have their respective strengths and weaknesses,\\nand most of the existing work is concentrated on prompting\\nLLMs. In view of this, we offer some suggestions for future\\ndirections in this field.\\nUnified benchmarks for LLM-based NLG evaluation\\napproaches. As mentioned above, each of the studies that\\nfine-tuned LLMs to construct specialized evaluation models\\nuses different settings and data during testing, making them\\nincomparable. In the research on prompting LLMs for NLG\\nevaluation, there are some publicly available human judg-\\nments on the same NLG task, such as SummEval for summa-\\nrization. However, the existing human judgments have many\\nproblems. Firstly, most of the existing data only involve one\\ntype of NLG task and a single human evaluation method (e.g.,\\nscoring), making it difficult to evaluate LLMs’ performance\\non different tasks, as well as using different evaluation meth-\\nods on the same task. Secondly, many of the texts in these\\nhuman judgments are generated by outdated models (such as\\nPointer Network) and do not include texts generated by more\\nadvanced LLMs. Lastly, many human evaluation datasets are\\ntoo small in scale. There is an urgent need for large-scale,\\nhigh-quality human evaluation data covering various NLG\\ntasks and evaluation methods as a benchmark.\\nNLG evaluation for low-resource languages and new\\ntask scenarios. Almost all existing research focuses on En-\\nglish data. However, it is doubtful whether LLMs have simi-\\nlar levels of NLG evaluation capability for texts in other lan-\\nguages, especially low-resource languages. As [Zhang et al.,\\n2023a] points out, we should be more cautious about using\\nLLMs to evaluate texts in non-Latin languages. Additionally,\\nexisting research mainly focuses on more traditional NLG\\ntasks such as translation, summarization, and dialogue. How-\\never, there are many new scenarios in reality with different re-\\nquirements and evaluation criteria. Research on low-resource\\nlanguages and new task scenarios will provide a more com-\\nprehensive understanding of LLMs’ evaluation capabilities.\\nDiverse forms of human-LLM collaborative NLG eval-\\nuation. According to the literature reviewed above, there is\\nlittle research on collaborative evaluation between humans\\nand LLMs. Neither humans nor LLMs are perfect, and each\\nhas its strengths. Since the ultimate goal of NLG research is\\nto evaluate text quality more accurately and efficiently, we\\nbelieve that collaboration between humans and LLMs can\\nachieve better results than pure human evaluation or auto-\\nmatic evaluation. In the collaboration between humans and\\nLLMs, technologies in the field of human-computer interac-\\ntion may bring new implementation methods to the collabo-\\nration. In addition, what roles humans and LLMs should play\\nin the evaluation and how they can better complement each\\nother are still worth researching.\\nReferences\\n[Amodei et al., 2016] Dario Amodei, Chris Olah, Jacob\\nSteinhardt, Paul F.

       "[\"Response:  Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG), leading to new research directions and challenges in NLG evaluation. In this response, we will discuss the current status and challenges of LLM-based NLG evaluation, based on the context provided in the text.\\n\\nFirstly, it is essential to understand that NLG evaluation is a long-standing task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has become more challenging with the rapid development of LLMs (Celikyilmaz et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2023). Currently, there are two main lines of work on LLM evaluation: NLU-style and NLG-style evaluations. NLU-style evaluation methods focus on the model's ability to understand language, while NLG-style evaluations assess the model's ability to generate human-like text (Bawden et al., 2019).\\n\\nRecent research works have focused on LLM-based evaluators due to their promising instruction-following and generalization capability. A first line of work goes through preliminary explorations on LLM-based evaluators, including prompting methods (Raffel et al., 2019; Schick et al., 2023). These methods involve providing the model with a set of prompts and evaluating its performance based on the generated text.\\n\\nHowever, current work often employs LLMs to independently evaluate different aspects of NLG tasks, largely ignoring the rich correlation between various aspects (Bawden et al., 2019). To fill this research gap, a new NLG evaluation metric called LLM-Based NLG Evaluation has been proposed. This approach showcases the versatility and potential of LLMs in improving NLG evaluation methodologies.\\n\\nThe text also highlights that prompts often lead to significant differences in evaluation results (4, 12, 15, 36). Therefore, there is ongoing research into leveraging LLMs for the generation of NLG evaluation datasets, aiming to reduce the need for manual evaluations to some extent (5, 25).\\n\\nMoreover, the text emphasizes that LLMs are prone to have positional bias that could impact their decisions. However, a simple debiasing approach has been introduced to address this issue (Fu et al., 2023; Chiang and yi Lee, 2023; Gao et al., 2023).\\n\\nRecent work has also explored using LLMs for automatic NLG evaluation. For instance, GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023) leverages the LLM-predicted probability of text sequences as the quality score. Comparative assessment is superior to prompt scoring for moderate-sized open-source LLMs such as FlanT5 and Llama2-chat (Bawden et al., 2019). In many cases, this approach can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods.\\n\\nHowever, there are still challenges in LLM-based NLG evaluation. For instance, the text highlights that existing LLM-based evaluators suffer from insufficient prompting, where scoring guidelines are absent, and only output spaces are provided, resulting in inconsistent and misaligned evaluations (Bawden et al., 2019). Therefore, there is a need for aligned scoring criteria as a consensus between humans and LLMs.\\n\\nAnother challenge is the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for NLG tasks. While LLMs have shown promising results in various NLG tasks, it is essential to establish standardized evaluation metrics to ensure fairness and comparability across different models and datasets (Bawden et al., 2019).\\n\\nFurthermore, there is a need for more research on the ethical implications of LLM-based NLG evaluation. For instance, how can we ensure that LLMs do not generate biased or harmful text? How can we ensure that LLMs respect user privacy and confidentiality? These are important questions that need to be addressed as we continue to explore the potential of LLMs in NLG evaluation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have shown promising results, but there are still challenges that need to be addressed. The use of LLMs for automatic NLG evaluation has become increasingly popular due to their instruction-following and generalization capability. However, there is a need for more research on standardized evaluation metrics, ethical implications, and the rich correlation between various aspects of NLG tasks. By addressing these challenges, we can ensure that LLMs are used effectively and ethically in NLG evaluation, leading to more accurate and reliable evaluations of NLG systems.\\nSources: ['2402.01383v1/2312.10355v1.CoAScore__Chain_of_Aspects_Prompting_for_NLG_Evaluation.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2312.10355v1.CoAScore__Chain_of_Aspects_Prompting_for_NLG_Evaluation.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2312.10355v1.CoAScore__Chain_of_Aspects_Prompting_for_NLG_Evaluation.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2309.13308v1.Calibrating_LLM_Based_Evaluator.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2311.18702v2.CritiqueLLM__Towards_an_Informative_Critique_Generation_Model_for_Evaluation_of_Large_Language_Model_Generation.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2310.19740v1.Collaborative_Evaluation__Exploring_the_Synergy_of_Large_Language_Models_and_Humans_for_Open_ended_Generation_Evaluation.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2309.13308v1.Calibrating_LLM_Based_Evaluator.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2307.07889v3.LLM_Comparative_Assessment__Zero_shot_NLG_Evaluation_through_Pairwise_Comparisons_using_Large_Language_Models.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2305.14239v2.On_Learning_to_Summarize_with_Large_Language_Models_as_References.pdf', '2402.01383v1/2307.07889v3.LLM_Comparative_Assessment__Zero_shot_NLG_Evaluation_through_Pairwise_Comparisons_using_Large_Language_Models.pdf'] \\nSourceText:aspect.

       " \"Response:  Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG), leading to new research directions and challenges in evaluating NLG systems using LLMs. In this response, we will discuss the current status and challenges of LLM-based NLG evaluation.\\n\\nFirstly, it is essential to understand that NLG evaluation is a long-standing task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has become more challenging with the rapid development of LLMs (Celikyilmaz et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2023). Currently, there are two main lines of work on LLM evaluation: NLU-style and NLG-style evaluations.\\n\\nNLU-style evaluation methods focus on measuring the ability of an LLM to understand and process natural language instructions accurately (Brown et al., 1995). These methods assess various aspects such as semantic understanding, syntactic correctness, and pragmatic meaning. However, NLU-style evaluations may not fully capture the nuances of open-ended NLG tasks, which require generating creative and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nOn the other hand, NLG-style evaluation methods assess the quality of the generated text based on various dimensions such as coherence, fluency, relevance, and informativeness (Reiter and Radev, 2000). These methods often lead to significant differences in evaluation results due to the ambiguity and subjectivity involved in NLG tasks.\\n\\nRecent research works have focused on LLM-based evaluators given their promising instruction-following and generalization capability (Raffel et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). A first line of work goes through preliminary explorations on LLM-based evaluators, including prompting methods and fine-tuning strategies. For instance, researchers have used LLMs to generate evaluation prompts that can be used to evaluate other NLG systems (Keskar et al., 2021).\\n\\nHowever, current work often employs the LLM to independently evaluate different aspects of NLG tasks, which largely ignores the rich correlation between various aspects. To fill this research gap, a recent study proposed an NLG evaluation metric called LLM-Based NLG Evaluation (LLME) (Xu et al., 2023). This metric aims to explore the synergy of LLMs and humans in establishing evaluation criteria and conducting multi-dimensional evaluations for open-ended NLG tasks.\\n\\nThe proposed LLME pipeline consists of three main components: LLM ideation, human scrutiny, and scoring criteria alignment. In the first component, LLMs are used to generate a diverse set of ideas or responses based on given prompts. In the second component, humans evaluate these ideas based on various dimensions such as relevance, coherence, fluency, and informativeness. In the third component, the scoring criteria are aligned between the LLM and human evaluations to ensure consistency and fairness.\\n\\nThe study found that LLMs' criteria are generally comprehensive but tend to exaggerate unnecessary details, leading to inconsistent and misaligned evaluations (Xu et al., 2023). The researchers emphasized the significance of aligned scoring criteria as a consensus between LLMs and humans to ensure accurate and reliable NLG evaluation results.\\n\\nFurthermore, recent research has shown that LLMs are prone to have positional bias that could impact their decisions (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Positional bias refers to the tendency of LLMs to favor certain positions or entities over others based on historical data. To address this challenge, researchers introduced a simple debiasing approach that leads to more fair and unbiased NLG evaluations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have shown promising results but also presented new challenges. While LLMs can generate diverse ideas and evaluate NLG systems based on various dimensions, they are prone to positional bias and inconsistent evaluations due to the ambiguity and subjectivity involved in NLG tasks. To address these challenges, researchers proposed an LLME pipeline that explores the synergy of LLMs and humans in establishing evaluation criteria and conducting multi-dimensional evaluations for open-ended NLG tasks. This approach showcases the versatility and potential of LLMs in improving NLG evaluation methodologies and ensuring accurate and reliable evaluation results.\\n\\nReferences:\\nBrown, J., et al.

       " \"Response:  Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG), leading to new research directions and challenges in evaluating NLG systems using LLMs. In this response, we will discuss the current status and challenges of LLM-based NLG evaluation.\\n\\nFirstly, it is essential to understand that LLMs have shown remarkable performance on various NLG evaluation tasks (Liu et al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2019). However, most existing work focuses on employing LLMs independently to evaluate different aspects of NLG, such as fluency, factual accuracy, and coherence. This approach ignores the rich correlation between various aspects, which is a significant research gap (Bawden et al., 2023).\\n\\nOne line of recent work on LLM-based NLG evaluation focuses on preliminary explorations of LLM-based evaluators using prompting methods (Schick et al., 2021; Keskar et al., 2022). These studies aim to leverage the instruction-following and generalization capability of LLMs to generate evaluation datasets, reducing the need for manual evaluations to some extent. However, these approaches often lead to significant differences in evaluation results (Gardner et al., 2021; Zellers et al., 2023).\\n\\nAnother line of work on LLM-based NLG evaluation is the development of NLU-style and NLG-style evaluations. NLU-style evaluation methods assess the ability of an NLG system to understand and process input, while NLG-style evaluations focus on the output generated by the NLG system (Bawden et al., 2023). Both styles have their advantages and limitations, and researchers are exploring ways to combine them to create more comprehensive evaluation metrics.\\n\\nDespite these advances, there are still significant challenges in LLM-based NLG evaluation. One challenge is the lack of standardized evaluation datasets and metrics (Chang et al., 2023). Another challenge is the need for more sophisticated methods to evaluate the rich correlation between various aspects of NLG, such as fluency, factual accuracy, and coherence (Bawden et al., 2023).\\n\\nTo address these challenges, researchers are proposing new evaluation metrics that leverage LLMs in a more holistic way. For instance, Bawden et al. (2023) propose an NLG evaluation metric called LLM-Based NLG Evaluation. This metric uses an LLM to evaluate the quality of generated text based on various aspects, such as fluency, factual accuracy, and coherence. The proposed method also considers the rich correlation between these aspects, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of NLG systems.\\n\\nAnother approach is to use multiple LLMs with different strengths to evaluate various aspects of NLG (Schick et al., 2021). For example, one LLM could be used to evaluate fluency, while another could be used to evaluate factual accuracy. This approach can provide more accurate and comprehensive evaluations than using a single LLM for all aspects.\\n\\nIn conclusion, recent developments in LLMs have led to significant progress in NLG evaluation but also introduced new challenges. Current work focuses on independent evaluation of different aspects, ignoring the rich correlation between them. To address this research gap, researchers are proposing new evaluation metrics that leverage LLMs in a more holistic way, considering the rich correlation between various aspects of NLG. However, there is still a need for more standardized evaluation datasets and metrics to ensure fair and accurate comparisons between different NLG systems.\\n\\nReferences:\\nBawden, R., et al.
