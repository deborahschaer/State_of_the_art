        "abstract": "Web3 is the most hyped concept from 2020 to date, greatly motivating the\nprosperity of the Internet of Value and Metaverse. However, no solid evidence\nstipulates the exact definition, criterion, or standard in the sense of such a\nbuzzword. To fill the gap, we aim to clarify the term in this work. We narrow\ndown the connotation of Web3 by separating it from high-level controversy\nargues and, instead, focusing on its protocol, architecture, and evaluation\nfrom the perspective of blockchain fields. Specifically, we have identified all\npotential architectural design types and evaluated each of them by employing\nthe scenario-based architecture evaluation method. The evaluation shows that\nexisting applications are neither secure nor adoptable as claimed. Meanwhile,\nwe also discuss opportunities and challenges surrounding the Web3 space and\nanswer several prevailing questions from communities. A primary result is that\nWeb3 still relies on traditional internet infrastructure, not as independent as\nadvocated. This report, as of June 2022, provides the first strict research on\nWeb3 in the view of blockchain. We hope that this work would provide a guide\nfor the development of future Web3 services.",

From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0\nto the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have\nworked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed,\nthe next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and\nshaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more\nintelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or\ncriminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet\nand IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data\nownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet\nworld from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it\npromotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and\neconomic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed.\nHerein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on\ncurrent technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article\nfirst introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as\nseveral differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3. Then, some\ntechnical implementations of Web 3.0 are illustrated in detail. We discuss the\nrevolution and benefits that Web 3.0 brings.

A crucial component\nof any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many\nways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the\nlimitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel\nconsensus algorithms have been introduced.

However, the existing studies of consensus\nalgorithms are not comprehensive.

After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work\nfocuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their\noutput type, including text, images, videos, 3D content, etc., which depicts\nthe full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their\nsignificant applications in some mainstream industries, such as education and\ncreativity content. Finally, we discuss the challenges currently faced and\npresent an outlook on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.",

        "title": "Is ChatGPT a General-Purpose Natural Language Processing Task Solver?",
        "abstract": "Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated the ability to perform a variety of natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks zero-shot -- i.e., without adaptation on downstream data. Recently,\nthe debut of ChatGPT has drawn a great deal of attention from the natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) community due to the fact that it can generate\nhigh-quality responses to human input and self-correct previous mistakes based\non subsequent conversations. However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can\nserve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this\nwork, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by\nevaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task\ncategories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that\nChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g.,\narithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific\ntasks such as sequence tagging. We additionally provide in-depth analysis\nthrough qualitative case studies.",

        "title": "Anti-Money Laundering in Bitcoin: Experimenting with Graph Convolutional Networks for Financial Forensics",
        "abstract": "Anti-money laundering (AML) regulations play a critical role in safeguarding\nfinancial systems, but bear high costs for institutions and drive financial\nexclusion for those on the socioeconomic and international margins. The advent\nof cryptocurrency has introduced an intriguing paradox: pseudonymity allows\ncriminals to hide in plain sight, but open data gives more power to\ninvestigators and enables the crowdsourcing of forensic analysis. Meanwhile\nadvances in learning algorithms show great promise for the AML toolkit. In this\nworkshop tutorial, we motivate the opportunity to reconcile the cause of safety\nwith that of financial inclusion. We contribute the Elliptic Data Set, a time\nseries graph of over 200K Bitcoin transactions (nodes), 234K directed payment\nflows (edges), and 166 node features, including ones based on non-public data;\nto our knowledge, this is the largest labelled transaction data set publicly\navailable in any cryptocurrency. We share results from a binary classification\ntask predicting illicit transactions using variations of Logistic Regression\n(LR), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Graph Convolutional\nNetworks (GCN), with GCN being of special interest as an emergent new method\nfor capturing relational information. The results show the superiority of\nRandom Forest (RF), but also invite algorithmic work to combine the respective\npowers of RF and graph methods. Lastly, we consider visualization for analysis\nand explainability, which is difficult given the size and dynamism of\nreal-world transaction graphs, and we offer a simple prototype capable of\nnavigating the graph and observing model performance on illicit activity over\ntime. With this tutorial and data set, we hope to a) invite feedback in support\nof our ongoing inquiry, and b) inspire others to work on this societally\nimportant challenge.",

        "abstract": "Web3Recommend is a decentralized Social Recommender System implementation\nthat enables Web3 Platforms on Android to generate recommendations that balance\ntrust and relevance. Generating recommendations in decentralized networks is a\nnon-trivial problem because these networks lack a global perspective due to the\nabsence of a central authority. Further, decentralized networks are prone to\nSybil Attacks in which a single malicious user can generate multiple fake or\nSybil identities. Web3Recommend relies on a novel graph-based content\nrecommendation design inspired by GraphJet, a recommendation system used in\nTwitter enhanced with MeritRank, a decentralized reputation scheme that\nprovides Sybil-resistance to the system. By adding MeritRank's decay parameters\nto the vanilla Social Recommender Systems' personalized SALSA graph algorithm,\nwe can provide theoretical guarantees against Sybil Attacks in the generated\nrecommendations. Similar to GraphJet, we focus on generating real-time\nrecommendations by only acting on recent interactions in the social network,\nallowing us to cater temporally contextual recommendations while keeping a\ntight bound on the memory usage in resource-constrained devices, allowing for a\nseamless user experience. As a proof-of-concept, we integrate our system with\nMusicDAO, an open-source Web3 music-sharing platform, to generate personalized,\nreal-time recommendations. Thus, we provide the first Sybil-resistant Social\nRecommender System, allowing real-time recommendations beyond classic\nuser-based collaborative filtering. The system is also rigorously tested with\nextensive unit and integration tests. Further, our experiments demonstrate the\ntrust-relevance balance of recommendations against multiple adversarial\nstrategies in a test network generated using data from real music platforms.",

This type of token can be\nbound with virtual/digital properties as their unique identifications. With\nNFTs, all marked properties can be freely traded with customized values\naccording to their ages, rarity, liquidity, etc. It has greatly stimulated the\nprosperity of the decentralized application (DApp) market.

However, the development of the NFT ecosystem is\nstill in its early stage, and the technologies of NFTs are pre-mature.\nNewcomers may get lost in their frenetic evolution due to the lack of\nsystematic summaries. In this technical report, we explore the NFT ecosystems\nin several aspects. We start with an overview of state-of-the-art NFT\nsolutions, then provide their technical components, protocols, standards, and\ndesired proprieties.

        "abstract": "Much of the recent excitement around decentralized finance (DeFi) comes from\nhopes that DeFi can be a secure, private, less centralized alternative to\ntraditional finance systems. However, people moving to DeFi sites in hopes of\nimproving their security and privacy may end up with less of both as recent\nattacks have demonstrated. In this work, we improve the understanding of DeFi\nby conducting the first Web measurements of the security, privacy, and\ndecentralization properties of popular DeFi front ends. We find that DeFi\napplications -- or dapps -- suffer from the same security and privacy risks\nthat frequent other parts of the Web but those risks are greatly exacerbated\nconsidering the money that is involved in DeFi. Our results show that a common\ntracker can observe user behavior on over 56% of websites we analyzed and many\ntrackers on DeFi sites can trivially link a user's Ethereum address with PII\n(e.g., user name or demographic information), or phish users by initiating fake\nEthereum transactions.

Yet,\nthe boundaries between CeFi and DeFi may not be always so clear cut.\n  In this work, we systematically analyze the differences between CeFi and\nDeFi, covering legal, economic, security, privacy and market manipulation. We\nprovide a structured methodology to differentiate between a CeFi and a DeFi\nservice. Our findings show that certain DeFi assets (such as USDC or USDT\nstablecoins) do not necessarily classify as DeFi assets, and may endanger the\neconomic security of intertwined DeFi protocols. We conclude this work with the\nexploration of possible synergies between CeFi and DeFi.",

In this paper, we present\na comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon\ninsights from industry reports and academic research articles, we develop a\ntaxonomy to categorize these governance issues. We collect and build a dataset\nof 4,446 audit reports from 17 Web3 security companies, categorizing their\ngovernance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. We conducted a\nthorough analysis of governance issues and identified vulnerabilities in\ngovernance design and implementation, e.g., voting sybil attack and proposal\nfront-running. Our findings highlight a significant observation: the disparity\nbetween smart contract code and DeFi whitepapers plays a central role in these\ngovernance issues. As an initial step to address the challenges of\ncode-whitepaper consistency checks for DeFi applications, we built a\nmachine-learning-based prototype, and validated its performance on eight widely\nused DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall.
