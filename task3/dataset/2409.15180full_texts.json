    "2111.14203": " \nHow Deep Are the Fakes? \nFocusing on Audio Deepfake: A Survey \nZAHRA KHANJANI, GABRIELLE WATSON, and VANDANA P. JANEJA, University of Maryland \nBaltimore County, Information System department, USA \nDeepfake is content or material that is synthetically generated or manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, to be \npassed off as real and can include audio, video, image, and text synthesis. This survey has been conducted with a different \nperspective compared to existing survey papers, that mostly focus on just video and image deepfakes. This survey not only \nevaluates generation and detection methods in the different deepfake categories, but mainly focuses on audio deepfakes that \nare overlooked in most of the existing surveys. This paper\u2019s most important contribution is to critically analyze and provide \na unique source of audio deepfake research, mostly ranging from 2016 to 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \nfirst survey focusing on audio deepfakes in English. This survey provides readers with a summary of 1) different deepfake \ncategories 2) how they could be created and detected 3) the most recent trends in this domain and shortcomings in detection \nmethods 4) audio deepfakes, how they are created and detected in more detail which is the main focus of this paper. We found \nthat Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are \ncommon ways of creating and detecting deepfakes. In our evaluation of over 140 methods we found that the majority of the \nfocus is on video deepfakes and in particular in the generation of video deepfakes. We found that for text deepfakes there are \nmore generation methods but very few robust methods for detection, including fake news detection, which has become a \ncontroversial area of research because of the potential of heavy overlaps with human generation of fake content. This paper \nis an abbreviated version of the full survey and reveals a clear need to research audio deepfakes and particularly detection of \naudio deepfakes. \n \n \n1 INTRODUCTION \nDeepfakes have started impacting society in various ways. For example, deepfakes can be used to commit fraud. \nA CEO of a U.K energy based firm who thought he was on the phone with his German boss had asked him \nto send a transfer of 220,000 Euros to a Hungarian supplier [64]. The criminals had used AI based software to \nimpersonate him, and received one transfer of money. This may clarify the importance of deepfakes, and why \nthe attention to it has increased exponentially. A huge increase at the number of articles regarding deepfake \nhappened between 2018 and 2019 (from 60 to 309). On 24th July, It was linearly estimated that the number of \npapers related to deepfakes will increase to more than 730 until the end of 2020 [51]. However, the reality is more \nsurprising than the mentioned estimate since we found there are 1323 papers related to deepfakes that were \npublished until the end of 2020. The lack of focus on audio deepfakes in surveys is a strong motivation for this \narticle to concentrate on audio deepfakes, where it is heading and how to weaken its harmful effects. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present a systematic review on the scientific \npapers for each category of deepfakes, their generation and detection techniques and the most recent trends. \nMore details, the network schematics, as well as a quick guide table 1 of audio deepfake frameworks are provided \nin this section. Section 3 includes discussion and future directions. The summarization tables 2 and 3 of some of \nthe significant papers that are surveyed in this work are also presented in Section 3. Finally, our conclusions are \npresented in Section 4. We categorize deepfakes as shown in figure 1. Then, we describe each of these types of \ndeepfakes and ways by which they can be detected and created. \n \n \nAuthors\u2019 address: Zahra Khanjani, zkhanja1@umbc.edu; Gabrielle Watson, watson7@umbc.edu; Vandana P.

Janeja \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Deepfake categories \n \n \n2 DEEPFAKE CATEGORIES \nFor each category (audio, text, video, or image deepfakes), related papers are surveyed and the technology trends \nand frameworks are briefly discussed and shown in the figures. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the \nfirst survey focusing on audio deepfakes. In the audio deepfake section we discuss some important frameworks \nin detail and provide readers with sufficient guidance for audio deepfake tools as are shown in Table 1. In the \nfollowing sections, we begin the explanations of the deepfake categories. \n2.1 Audio deepfakes \nAudio deepfakes are AI generated or edited/synthesized to create fake audio that seems real. Detecting audio \ndeepfakes is really important since there have been some criminal activities using audio deepfakes in recent \nyears. To achieve audio deepfake detection, one firstly needs to know the generation methods. Figure 2 (a) shows \ndeepfake generation frameworks and trends, while Figure 2 (b) shows audio detection tools and trends. As figure \n2 indicates, audio deepfake methods are divided into three subcategories: Replay attack, speech synthesis, voice \nconversion. The reader is provided with the most recent and significant frameworks of each subcategory in this \nsection. \n2.1.1 \nReplay attacks. Replay attacks are defined as replaying the recording of a target speaker\u2019s voice. The two \nsubtypes are far field detection and cut and paste detection attacks [56]. In far field detection replay attacks, the \ntest segment is a far field microphone recording of the victim that has been replayed on a phone handset with \na loudspeaker. Cut and paste detection system is if a recording is made by cut and paste short recordings to \nfake the sentence required by a text dependent system [56]. To defend against replay attacks one can use text \ndependent speaker verification [72]. A current technique that detects end-to-end replay attacks is by using deep \nconvolutional networks [70]. \nSome of the replay attack detection systems have been proposed by working on the features which are fed \ninto the network [75]. Others have improved the networks used or have worked on both of the networks and \nfeatures [21, 23, 24, 38, 39, 42, 48]. Machine learning is not very effective for finding replay attacks because of \noverfitting due to the variability in speech signals [43]. It was found in the technique to detect replay attacks \nwith deep convolutional networks that they were able to get a perfect Equal Error Rate(EER) of 0 percent for the \ndevelopment and evaluation set for ASVspoof2017 [34]. It means the performance of the detection technique was \nreally better than the previous ones since before [70]. \n2.1.2 \nSpeech synthesis (SS). Speech synthesis is defined as artificially producing human speech by means of \nsoftware or hardware system programs. SS includes text to speech (TTS) which analyzes the text and makes the \nspeech sound in line with text inputted using the rules of linguistic description of the text. Speech synthesis can be \nused for purposes like reading text and being a personal AI assistant. Another benefit is speech synthesis can offer \ndifferent accents and voices instead of pre-recorded human voices. One of the leading speech synthesis companies \nis Lyrebird which uses deep learning models to generate 1,000 sentences in a second. TTS heavily depends on \nthe speech corpus quality to make the system and, unfortunately, it is expensive to create speech corpora ([36]. \nAnother disadvantage is that SS systems do not recognize periods or special characters [36]. Ambiguities with \nHow Deep Are the Fakes? \nFocusing on Audio Deepfake: A Survey \u2022 3 \n \nhomographs are the largest, which is when two words have different meanings but are written the same way \n[36]. ([5]). \nChar2Wav is an end-to-end speech synthesis generation framework. Also, WaveNet [52], a SS framework, \nis based on PixleCNN. Text-to-speech synthesis frameworks often include two phases (encoder and decoder), \nWaveGlow focuses on the second phase. Therefore, WaveGlow is regarding transforming some time-aligned \nfeatures, such as a mel-spectrogram obtained from encoder, into audio samples [57]. Tacotron, was originally \nsuggested in 2017 [74]. Tacotron includes CBHG which is (1-D convolution bank + highway network + bidirectional \nGRU) [40]. Tacotron 2 [60] system includes two components. The first component is a recurrent sequence-to- \nsequence feature prediction network with attention. The output of this component is a predicted sequence of mel \nspectrogram frames. The second component is a modified WaveNet vocoder. Conv: convolutional, Attention: \nLocation Sensitive Attention. \nDeep Voice3, a TTS framework, [55] includes 3 parts: \nEncoder: residual convolutional layers are used to encode text into per-timestep key and value vectors. \nDecoder: (key, value) is used by decoder to predict the mel-scale log magnitude spectrograms. It contains \ncausal convolutional blocks. Mel-band log-magnitude spectrogram is used as the compact low-dimensional \naudio frame representation. Two loss functions are used : L1 loss based on the output mel-spectrograms, \nand a binary cross-entropy loss based on the final-frame prediction. \nConverter: A fully-convolutional post-processing network. Based on the chosen vocoder and the de- \ncoder hidden states, it predicts the vocoder\u2019s parameters. Conv= convolutional, dotted arrows = the \nautoregressive process during inference. \nMelNet, a TTS framework [71], works in an autoregressive manner, and predicts a distribution element-by- \nelement over the time and frequency dimensions of a spectrogram. The network includes different computational \nstacks that extract features from different pieces of the input. Then, these features will be collectively summarized \nto make the full context. The previous-layer\u2019s outputs of the frequency-delayed stack are current-layer\u2019s \noutput of the time-delayed and centralized stacks respectively. The outputs of the final layer of the \nfrequency-delayed stack are used to compute the needed parameters for the audio generation. \nUsing neural network TTS synthesis can make the speech audio in the voice of many speakers even those not \nin the training. This only needed five seconds [28]. The first model to synthesize audio directly from text was \nChar2Wav which is end-to-end speech synthesis which has a reader and a neural vocoder to accomplish this \n[62]. Deep Voice 1 was the first to operate in real time for deep neural networks for text to speech, which is the \nfoundation for end to end neural speech synthesis[7] and Deep Voice 2 [20], was able to reproduce many voices \nusing the same system. Moreover, most neural network based models for speech synthesis are auto regressive, \nmeaning that they condition the audio samples on previous samples for long term modeling and are simple to \ntrain and implement [57].The SS detection systems are also used for voice conversion (VC) detection, so we review \nthe detection methods for these two categories in the VC summary section. \n2.1.3 \nVoice conversion (VC) and Impersonation. The last subcategory of audio deepfakes is voice conversion, \nwhich takes the speech signal by the first speaker, the source, and modifies it to sound like it was spoken by the \nsecond speaker, i.e., the target speaker. Impersonation that can be considered as a kind of VC is pretending to be \nanother person. it is faster now to impersonate with new technology and one company called Overdub[5] can do \nan impression of any voice with one minute of sample audio. Also, GANs can be used for voice impersonation \n[19]. \nOne of the most important bases for VC is the joint density Gaussian mixture model with maximum likelihood \nparameter trajectory generation considering global variance [67]. This model is also the baseline of the open-source \nFestvox system that was the main VC toolkit in \" The voice conversion challenge 2016\" [68]. Voice conversion can \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n4    \u2022    Zahra Khanjani, Gabrielle Watson, and Vandana P. Janeja \n \n \nbe also based on other methods such as neural networks as well as speaker interpolation [27, 49, 67]. However, in \nrecent years GANs are widely used for VC due to their flexibility as well as high-quality results. The research of \n[19] used a neural network framework to impersonate voices from different genders well with reconstructing \ntime domain signals with the Griffin Lim method. This led to the model creating very convincing samples of \nimpersonated speech. There are also different frameworks for audio spoofing detection. ResNet which was firstly \nused for image recognition, is utilized as the base of the audio spoofing (VC and SS) detection system [13]. It is \nalso improved to reduce EER metric as well as solve the generalization problem [12]. In addition, some of the \naudio spoofing detection systems have been extended by working on the features which are fed into the network \n[8]. While others have worked on the networks used or both of the networks and features [6, 14, 44, 53, 59, 73]. \nQuick guide table 1 is provided, and it contains different audio deepfake tools, their summarized key features \nas well as high-starred GitHub repository links. \n \n2.2 Text Deepfake \nThe text deepfake field is teeming with papers and techniques to create deepfakes, and detection methods are \ncatching up but not fast enough. \nExposed fabrications One of the subcategories of a textual deepfake is exposed fabrications which are those \nthat are being fraudulently reported, like tabloids and yellow press which use sensationalism and eye-catching \nheadlines to get more profit/traffic utilizing AI methods. \nHumorous fakes The next subcategory of textual deepfakes are humorous fakes which is information that if \nthe readers do not know that it is of humorous intent, they might take the information at face value. \nLarge hoax The last subcategory of textual deepfakes is the large hoax which is falsification or deliberate \nfabrication in mainstream media that attempts to deceive audiences that it is real news which can be picked up \nby traditional news outlets. Figure 3 presents a summary of different text deepfake generation and detection \nframeworks and features. \n \n2.3 Video deepfake \nA summary for video deepfakes generation and detection frameworks and features are provided in Figure 4. \nGenerally, video editing has been around for a while since 1997 in Forrest Gump to digitally put in archival \nfootage of JFK and manipulate his mouth movements[4]. Later, deepfake technology made video editing more \nbelievable. Many YouTube channels like Ctr Shift Face [2] post video deepfakes with increasing capabilities due \nto the new tools and the vast amount of training data that is available on the internet. \nReenactment The first subcategory of video deepfakes is reenactment in which a person manipulates the \nidentity to impersonate it and control what the identity says or does for the expression, body, dubbing, pose, and \ngaze. The expression refers to the reenactment which drives the expression of the face. The mouth reenactment is \nalso called \u2018dubbing\u2019 or lip sync. The pose is when one head position is driven by another and the gaze reenactment \nis where the direction of the eyes and the position of the eyelids are driven by another. Body reenactment uses \nhuman pose synthesis or pose transfer [45]. Everyone can dance now is an example of this type of deepfake[9]. \nVideo synthesis is when one creates a video without a target to base it off of. Editing and synthesis are very \nsimilar in the regards that you are creating a new video when editing while synthesis you are creating an entire \nnew video [45]. From video synthesis it was found that neural textures can be used to render/manipulate existing \nvideo content in static and dynamic environments in real time [66]. \nFaceSwap: The last category of video deepfakes is FaceSwap which is when someone\u2019s face in an image or \nvideo is replaced with another persons face([3] ). \nHow Deep Are the Fakes? \nFocusing on Audio Deepfake: A Survey \u2022 5 \n \n2.4 Image Deepfakes: \nThe last category discussed for deepfake technology is image deepfakes. Figure 5 provides the readers with a \nquick summary of image deepfake\u2019s generation and detection features and frameworks. \nFaceswap One of the subcategories is faceswap. Snapchat was the beginning of the face swap technology \navailable to the public [63]. Fakeapp is still the most popular face swapping app at the moment when it went \nviral around the world for showing people what they would look like when they were older and doing gender \nswaps[1]. \nSynthesis Image synthesis can allow someone to make a new AI generated image . It is easy to make deepfakes \nGANs now more than ever and there have been instances of synthesizing images that use GANs. NVIDIA\u2019s 112 \ncan make endless variations of the same image [32]. StyleGAN2 is helping detect image deepfakes as it can see if \nthe picture is generated by a network or not[32]. \nEditing Editing images using photoshop tools have been used for many years. However, image editing using \nAI tools has proposed robust way to edit the images vastly. \nFrom the research conducted there seemed to be a plethora of papers written for image detection and creation as \nseen in the diagram 5. The survey performed by [69] has evaluated different image (focusing on face) manipulation \nas well as detection techniques. \n2.5 Discussion and Future directions \nThis section firstly presents the critical discussion, analysis and summarization regarding the compiled works \nfocusing on audio deepfake generation. Then, a summarization of the current techniques as well as future \ndirections against deepfake is presented. Table 2 summarizes the key papers related to audio deepfake surveyed. \nTable 3 summarizes the key papers of the other types of deepfakes surveyed. \n2.5.1 \nDeepfake generation. In deepfake generation, the most significant aspect is how believable it is to the \nvictim, that means \u201cdeepfake quality\u201d. \nData vs Quality (MOS) The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is \"the arithmetical mean of individual ratings \ngiven by different users\". MOS has been used in many researches surveyed here to identify the quality of the \naudio. Given our evaluation of different audio deepfake frameworks\u2019 performance, the Mean Opinion Score \n(MOS) of the generated audio is better when the framework is trained using single speaker datasets([52]; [55], \n[35], [37]. It means that training the models using multi-speaker datasets to generate natural audio samples \ncould be challenging. MelNet [71] which has used a 140 hour single speaker dataset, as well as VoxCeleb2 [15] \nmulti-speaker dataset, has a better performance than the previous works. The VoxCeleb2 dataset contains over \n2,000 hours of audio data with real world noise. In addition, the dataset is captured from speakers of 145 different \nnationalities including different accents, ages and languages. The researchers are highly recommended to used \ndifferent multi-speaker data such as VoxCeleb2 dataset and evaluate the obtained generalization. \nSampling Frequency (kHz) vs Quality (MOS): When the sampling frequency (sampling rate) of the audio \ndeepfakes is less than 16kHz, perceived speech quality of audio deepfakes drops significantly, and the higher \nsampling rate may give way to higher audio quality ([57]). For future research the impact of different sampling \nrates on the audio deepfake quality could be investigated. \nAvailability vs Quality We also found that the more availability and reproducibility, the more development \nthe technology will have. The frameworks including their code as well as the datasets used that are available \npublicly (e.g., [55, 60, 62, 71, 74]) are more likely to be used for nefarious purposes or research, so they will be \nmore developed. It is recommended that academic centers prepare a researching environment to share deepfake \nrelated frameworks and datasets with just researchers. \nUsing Other deepfake types for a certain type: As we could see, a framework that has been proposed for \ngeneration of a certain type of deepfake, could be used for generation of another type of deepfake with some \n6    \u2022    Zahra Khanjani, Gabrielle Watson, and Vandana P. Janeja \n \n \nchanges. For example, CycleGAN and StarGAN are two frameworks for image deepfake generation that are \nused as the base of two audio deepfake frameworks [17, 30], which can work with non-parallel data not just \nparallel ones. Data conditions for VC could be parallel or non-parallel. Parallel VC datasets refer to the datasets \nwith utterances of the same linguistic content, but uttered by different people [80], but in practice, non-parallel \nVC which is more challenging is needed. It seems that more work should be done regarding audio deepfake \nframeworks using non-parallel data, and in this way researchers may use image deepfake frameworks as the \nbase of their proposed framework. \n2.5.2 \nFuture defense against deepfakes. The approaches that are mentioned in the following paragraphs offer a \nmodest defense against deepfakes. \nPrevention For prevention of deepfakes some suggest blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies \n(DLTs) be used for finding data provenance and tracing the information ([10, 18, 33, 78]). Extracting and comparing \naffective cues corresponding to perceived emotions from the digital content is also proposed as a way to combat \ndeepfakes [46]. Some recommend the content be ranked by participants and AI regarding if it is fake or real [11]. \nFor future directions, deepfake prevention is the area that needs more attention. Especially, researchers could \nextend using DLTs for digital content traceability, as well as using affective computing to combat deepfakes. \nMitigation It might be better to keep some detection tools proprietary only to people who need it like fact \ncheckers for reporters. This is so those making the generation models, perhaps for nefarious purposes, would \nnot know exactly what features make it easier to detect a deepfake like. Additionally, the journals as well as \nacademic centers can make researchers who work on extending deepfake generation frameworks, propose a \nstrong method for detecting the deepfakes generated by their frameworks (e.g., [9] has proposed it for their \nframework \u201cEverybody Dance Now\u201d). \nDetection In the following sentences, we present our summarization and future directions about the spoofing \ndetection systems focusing on \u201caudio deepfakes\u201d. In audio deepfake replay attack detection some of the \nframeworks have been proposed by working on the features which are fed into the network (e.g., [75]). Others \nhave improved the networks used or have worked on both networks and features simultaneously (e.g., [24, 38, 39]. \nAnother category of audio deepfake detection systems aims to detect speech synthesis as well as voice conversion. \nMost of them use different DNNs such as ResNet (e.g., [12, 13]) to detect spoofing. Additionally, some of the \naudio spoofing detection methods have been extended by working on the features which are fed into the \nnetwork (e.g., [8]). While others have changed the networks used or have improved both networks and features \n(e.g., [6, 14, 44, 53, 59, 73]). Given the fact that one of the most important deepfake detection challenges is \n\u201cgeneralization\u201d, researchers are highly recommended to work on generalization by changing or improving both \nof the networks and features as well as defining different loss functions (e.g., [12, 82]). \nGiven the aforementioned categories, we summarized some of the most important references regarding audio \ndeepfakes which are used in this survey in table 2. \nThe references which are about the other deepfake types are summarized in Table 3. For text deepfakes, a very \nrich summarization is available [16, 22], therefore we only mentioned three new works in the text deepfake area \nbelow. \nAdditionally, for visual deepfakes (image and video) there are some more surveys (e.g., [45, 51, 81].) \n2.6 Conclusion: \nPeople not just in this research field but the everyday person, need to be aware of deepfakes and the harm they \ncan cause to minimize the adverse effects. Also, we need to question what we see and hear online since the \ncontent can be misleading. The categories of deepfakes were broken down into four categories: audio, video, \nphoto, and textual. There were also subcategories discussed in each of the main four categories along with the \nadvantages, disadvantages, and summary of the methods for each subcategory. In addition, in this research, we \nHow Deep Are the Fakes? \nFocusing on Audio Deepfake: A Survey \u2022 7 \n \nhave focused on audio deepfake generation and detection. We have provided a summary overview of how the \ntechnologies which are used to create or detect audio deepfakes work, and also the details of their architectures. \nWe hope this survey serves as a guide for people who are interested in understanding and preventing malicious \ndeepfakes, and those who want to use deepfakes for well-meaning purposes. More research needs to be done in \nthe field of audio and text deepfakes, especially audio since there is already a plethora of detection for different \ncategories of textual deepfakes, specifically in the category of fake news. \n8    \u2022    Zahra Khanjani, Gabrielle Watson, and Vandana P.

Although there are some\nreview literatures, there has been no comprehensive survey that provides researchers with a systematic overview of these\ndevelopments with a unified evaluation. Accordingly, in this survey paper, we first highlight the key differences across various types of\ndeepfake audio, then outline and analyse competitions, datasets, features, classifications, and evaluation of state-of-the-art\napproaches. For each aspect, the basic techniques, advanced developments and major challenges are discussed. In addition, we\nperform a unified comparison of representative features and classifiers on ASVspoof 2021, ADD 2023 and In-the-Wild datasets for\naudio deepfake detection, respectively.

These technologies\nenable the generation of human-like natural speech that\nproves difficult to distinguish from real audio. Admittedly,\nthe development in these technologies significantly improve\nthe conveniences of our life in many scenarios, such as in-\ncar navigation systems, e-book readers, intelligent robots\netc. They nonetheless also pose a serious threat to social\nsecurity and political economy if someone misuses the so-\ncalled deepfake technologies for malicious purposes. The\nterm deepfake [3] refers to the usage of deep learning meth-\nods to seamlessly swap faces in videos on Reddit in 2017.\nNowadays, deepfake is now generically used by the media\nor people to refer to any audio or video in which important\nattributes have been either digitally altered or swapped,\nwith the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Fraudsters used\nAI based software to mimic a chief executive\u2019s voice and\ndemand a fraudulent transfer of USD 243, 000 in 2019 [4]. In\nresponse to these attacks, it is necessary to be able to detect\ndeepfake audio.\nAudio deepfake detection is a task that aims to dis-\ntinguish genuine utterances from fake ones via machine\nlearning techniques as shown in Figure 1. An increasing\nnumber of attempts [5]\u2013[7] have been made to further the\ndevelopment of audio deepfake detection.

The pipeline solution, consisting of a front-end\nfeature extractor and a back-end classifier, has become the\nde facto standard framework over the last decades.

Pre-\nvious studies mainly involve five kinds of deepfake audio:\ntext-to-speech, voice conversion, emotion fake, scene fake,\npartially fake. The characteristics of different deepfake types\nare summarised in Table 1.\nTABLE 1\nSummary of audio deepfake types in past studies.\nFake Type\nFake Trait\nFake Duration\nAI-aided\nText-to-speech (TTS)\nSpeaker identity,\nSpeech content\nFully\nYes\nVoice conversion (VC)\nSpeaker identity\nFully\nYes\nEmotion fake\nSpeaker emotion\nFully\nYes\nScene fake\nAcoustic scene\nFully\nYes\nPartially fake\nSpeech content\nPartially\nYes\n2.1.1\nText-to-Speech\nText-to-speech (TTS) [8], commonly known as speech syn-\nthesis and shown in Figure 2 (a), aims to synthesise intel-\nligible and natural speech, given any arbitrary text, using\nmachine learning based models. TTS models can generate\nrealistic and human-like speech with the development of\ndeep neural networks [1]. TTS systems mainly include text\nanalysis and speech waveform generation modules. There\nare two major methods on speech waveform generation:\nconcatenative [13], [14] and statistical parametric TTS [15].\nThe latter often consists of an acoustic model and a vocoder.\nMost recently, some end-to-end models have been proposed\nto generate high-quality sounding audio, such as Variational\nInference with adversarial learning for end-to-end Text-to-\nSpeech (VITS) [16] and FastDiff-TTS [17].\n2.1.2\nVoice Conversion\nVoice conversion (VC) [8] refers to cloning a person\u2019s voice\ndigitally as shown in Figure 2 (b). It aims to change the\ntimbre and prosody of a given speaker\u2019s speech to that of\nanother speaker, while the content of the speech remians\nthe same. The input to a VC system is a natural utterance of\nthe given speaker. There are about three main approaches of\nVC technologies: statistical parametric [18], [19], frequency\nwarping [20] and unit-selection [21]. Statistical parametric\nmodel also has a vocoder which is similiar to that in statisti-\ncal parametric TTS [22], [23]. In recent years, end-to-end VC\nmodels have also been proposed to mimic a person\u2019s voice\ncharacteristics [24].\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n3\nTABLE 2\nCharacteristics of representative competitions on audio fake detection.\nCompetition\nLanguage\nYear\n#Registration\n#Submission\nTask\nFake Type\nDeepfake\nGoal\nBaseline Model\nFeatures\nClassifiers\n2015\n28\n16\nLA\nTTS, VC\nNo\nDetection\n-\n-\n2017\n113\n49\nPA\nReplay\nNo\nDetection\nCQCC\nGMM\n48\nLA\nTTS, VC\nNo\nDetection\n2019\n154\n50\nPA\nReplay\nNo\nDetection\nLFCC, CQCC\nGMM\n41\nLA\nTTS, VC\nNo\nDetection\n23\nPA\nReplay\nNo\nDetection\nASVspoof\nEnglish\n2021\n198\n33\nDF\nDeepfake\nYes\nDetection\nLFCC, CQCC, Raw\nGMM, LCNN, RawNet2\n48\nLF\nTTS, VC\nYes\nDetection\n33\nPF\nPartially fake\nYes\nDetection\n2022\n121\n39\nFG\nTTS, VC\nYes\nGame fake\nLFCC, Raw\nGMM, LCNN, RawNet2\n63\nFG\nTTS, VC\nYes\nGame fake\nLFCC, Wav2vec2.0\nGMM, LCNN\n16\nRL\nPartially fake\nYes\nForensics\nLFCC\nLCNN\nADD\nChinese\n2023\n145\n11\nAR\nTTS, VC\nYes\nAttribution\nLFCC\nResNet + Openmax\n2.1.3\nEmotion Fake\nEmotion fake [25] seeks to change the audio in such a\nway that the emotion of the speech changes, while other\ninformation remains the same, such as speaker identity\nand speech content. Changing emotions of the voice often\nleads to semantics changes. An example of emotion fake\nis illustrated in Figure 2 (c). The original utterance said by\nspeaker B is with a happy emotion. The fake utterance is the\naudio where the happy emotion has been changed into a\nsad emotion. There are two kinds of methods on emotional\nVC called emotion fake [26]: parallel data based and non-\nparallel data based methods.\n2.1.4\nScene Fake\nScene fake [27] involves the tempering of the acoustic scene\nof the original utterance with another scene via speech\nenhancement technologies while the speaker identity and\nspeech content remain unchanged. An example of scene\nfake is shown in Figure 2 (d). The acoustic scene of the real\nutterance is \u201cOffice\u201d. The acoustic scene of the fake utterance\nis \u201cAirport\u201d. If the scene of an original audio is manipulated\nwith another one, authenticity and integrity verification of\nthe audio will be unreliable and even the semantic meaning\nof the original audio could be changed.\n2.1.5\nPartially Fake\nPartially fake [28] focuses on only changing several words\nin an utterance. The fake utterance is generated by manip-\nulating the original utterances with genuine or synthesized\naudio clips. The speaker of the original utterance and fake\nclips is the same person. The synthesized audio clips, while\nkeeping the speaker identity unchanged. An example of\npartially fake is shown in Figure 2 (e).\n2.2\nCompetitions\nOver the last few years, a series of competitions have played\na key role in accelerating the development of audio deep-\nfake detection, such as the ASVspoof1 and ADD2 challenges.\nTable 2 shows the characteristics and baseline models of the\nrepresentative competitions.\nThe ASVspoof challenges mainly focus on detecting\nspoofed audio from the perspective of protecting ASV sys-\ntems from attack. The ASVspoof 2015 [29] involves logical\n1. https://www.asvspoof.org\n2. http://addchallenge.cn\naccess (LA) task involving the detection of synthetic and\nconverted utterances. The ASVspoof 2017 [30] only has one\ntask named physical access (PA), which includes replay\nattacks. The ASVspoof 2019 [31] consists of two tasks: LA\nand PA, which are included in previous two challenges.\nSpeech deepfake detection task is included in the ASVspoof\n2021 [32], which consists of three tasks: LA, PA and speech\ndeepfake (DF). The DF task involves compressed audio\nsimilar to the LA task.\nThe ADD 2022 challenge [33] was organized by includ-\ning three tasks: low-quality fake audio detection (LF), par-\ntially fake audio detection (PF) and audio fake game (FG).\nThe LF task focuses on dealing with genuine and fully fake\nutterances with various real-world noises and interferences\netc. The PF task aims to distinguish between partially fake\nand real audio. The FG task is a rivalry game involving\nan audio generation task and an audio fake detection task,\nwherein the generation task participants aim to generate\naudio that could deceive the detection systems submitted\nby the detection task participants. The results in ADD 2022\nshow that it is difficult to use the same model to deal with\nall fake types. The result also show that the generalisation\nof detection techniques remains an open problem. Different\nfrom previous challenges (e.g. ADD 2022), ADD 2023 [34]\nfocuses on surpassing the constraints of binary real or\nfake classification, and actually localizing the manipulated\nintervals in a partially fake utterance as well as pinpointing\nthe source responsible for generating any fake audio. The\nADD 2023 challenge includes three subchallenges: audio\nfake game (FG), manipulation region location (RL) and\ndeepfake algorithm recognition (AR).\n2.3\nBenchmark Datasets\nThe development of audio deepfake detection techniques\nhas been largely dependent on well-established datasets\nwith various fake types and diverse acoustic conditions. A\nvariety of datasets have been designed to protect ASV sys-\ntems or human listeners from spoofing or deceiving. Table 3\nhighlights the characteristics of representative datasets on\naudio deepfake detection.\nMany early studies designed spoofed datasets to de-\nvelop spoofing countermeasures for ASV systems. In the\nearly days, a diverse set of spoofing datasets were propri-\netary due to the design of a dataset depending very much\non the specific spoofing approach assumed in a particular\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n4\nTABLE 3\nCharacteristics of representative datasets on audio deepfake detection.

Some spoofing datasets are designed only involving\na kind of TTS method [35] or a sort of VC approach [36], [37].\nHowever, it is difficult to make comparisons across different\nspoofing methods. To alleviate this issue, several spoofed\ndatasets including multiple approaches are designed by Wu\net al. [38] and Alegre et al. [36], which involve replay,\nTTS and VC technologies. But the varieties of spoofing\ntechniques are still insufficient compared to the diversity\nrequired by generalised countermeasure studies. In order\nto conduct repeatable and comparable spoofing detection\nstudies, Wu et al. [39] develop a standard public spoof-\ning dataset SAS which consists of various TTS and VC\nmethods in 2015. The SAS dataset is used to support the\nfirst ASVspoof challenge (ASVspoof 2015) aiming to detect\nthe spoofed speech [29]. Replay is considered as a lowcost\nand challenging attack included in the ASVspoof 2017 chal-\nlenge [40]. The ASVspoof 2019 and 2021 datasets [41] both\nconsist of replay, TTS and VC attacks. Previous datasets\nin ASVspoof challenges focus on detecting speech attacks\nin the microphone channel. Lavrentyeva et al. [42] design\na PhoneSpoof dataset for speaker verification systems, in\nwhich the utterances are collected in telephone channels.\nA partially spoofed database [43] is designed by using\nvoice activity detection technologies to randomly concate-\nnate spoofed utterances.\nA few audio deepfake detection datasets have been\ndeveloped to protect people from deceiving by deepfake\naudio. The deepfake types contained in the datasets mainly\ninclude: TTS, VC, emotion fake, scene fake and partially\nfake. In 2020, Reimao et al. [44] developed a publicly\navailable dataset FoR containing synthetic utterances, which\nare generated with open-sourced TTS tools. A private fake\ndataset is constructed using the open-sourced VC and TTS\nsystems [6]. In 2021, Frank et al. [45] developed a fake audio\ndataset named WaveFake, which contained two speakers\u2019\nfake utterances synthesised by the latest TTS models. Audio\ndeepfake attacks are included in ASVspoof 2021 [32], which\nconsider data compression effects. However, these datasets\nhave not covered some real-life challenging situations. The\ndatasets in ADD 2022 challenge are designed to fill the\ngap [33]. The fake utterances in LF dataset are generated\nusing the latest state-of-the-art TTS and VC models, which\ncontain diversified noise interference. The fake utterances in\nPF dataset are chosen from the HAD dataset designed by Yi\net al. [28], which are generated by manipulating the original\ngenuine utterances with real or synthesized audio segments\nof several key words, such as named entities. The detection\ntask dataset of the FG track (FG-D) are randomly selected\nfrom the submitted utterances of generation task in ADD\n2022. A Chinese synthetic speech detection dataset FMFCC-\nA [46] contains 13 types of fake audio involving noise addi-\ntion and audio compression. The above-mentioned datasets\nhave played a pivotal role in accelerating the development\nof audio deepfake detection. However, the fake utterances\nmainly involve changing speaker identity, speech content\nor channel noise of the original audio. Most recently, Zhao\net al. [25] design an emotion fake audio detection dataset\nnamed EmoFake, where the original emotion of a speaker\u2019s\nspeech has been manipulated with another one but other\ninformation still remains the same. A scene manipulation\naudio dataset named SceneFake is constructed by Yi et\nal. [27], in which the acoustic scene of an original utterance\nis replaced with another one using speech enhancement\ntechnologies. In 2022, a real-world dataset named In-the-\nWild are collected from publicly available sources such as\nsocial networks and popular video sharing platforms, where\nthe utterances are from English-speaking celebrities and\npoliticians [47].\n2.4\nEvaluation Metrics\nPreviously, equal error rate (EER) is used as the evalu-\nation metrics for audio deepfake detection tasks in the\nASVspoof [32] and ADD [33] challenges. The \u2019threshold-\nfree\u2019 EER is defined as follows. Let Pfa(\u03b8) and Pmiss(\u03b8)\ndenote the false alarm and miss rates at threshold \u03b8.\nPfa(\u03b8) = #{fake trials with score > \u03b8}\n#{total fake trials}\n(1)\nPmiss(\u03b8) = #{genuine trials with score < \u03b8}\n#{total genuine trials}\n(2)\nSo Pfa(\u03b8) and Pmiss(\u03b8) are, respectively, monotoni-\ncally decreasing and increasing functions of \u03b8. The EER\ncorresponds to the error rate at the threshold \u03b8EER at\nwhich the two detection error rates are equal, i.e. EER =\nPfa(\u03b8EER) = Pmiss(\u03b8EER).\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n5\nThere are two rounds of evaluations in the detection task\nof audio fake game track in ADD challenges [33], [34]. Each\nround evaluation has each own ranking in terms of EER.\nThe final ranking is in terms of the weighted EER (WEER),\nwhich is defined as follows.\nWEER = \u03b1 \u2217EER R1 + \u03b2 \u2217EER R2\n(3)\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 denotes the weight of the corresponding\nEER, EER R1 and EER R2 are the EER of the first and\nsecond round evaluation in the detection task of audio fake\ngame track, respectively.\n3\nDISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES\nThe feature extraction is a key module of the pipeline\ndetector. The goal of feature extraction is to learn dis-\ncriminative features via capturing audio fake artifacts from\nspeech signals. Large amounts of efforts [48]\u2013[50] have\nshown the importance of useful features for detecting fake\nattacks. The features used in previous studies can be roughly\ndivided into four categories: short-term spectral features,\nlong-term spectral features, prosodic features and deep fea-\ntures. Short- and long-term spectral features are extracted\nlargely by relying on digital signal processing algorithms.\nShort-term spectral features, extracted from short frames\ntypically with durations of 20-30 ms, describe the short-term\nspectral envelope involving an acoustic correlate of voice\ntimbre. However, short-term spectral features have been\ndemonstrated inadequate in capturing temporal character-\nistics of speech feature trajectories. In response to this, some\nresearchers propose long-term spectral features to capture\nlong-range information from speech signals. In addition,\nprosodic features are used to detect fake speech. Unlike the\nshort-term spectral features from short duration, prosodic\nfeatures spans over longer segments, such as phones, sylla-\nbles, words, and utterances etc. Most of the aforementioned\nspectral and prosodic features are hand-crafted features, the\ndesign of which is flawed by biases due to limitations of\nhandmade representations [51]. So deep features, extracted\nvia deep neural network based models, are motivated to\nfill the gap. The characteristics and relationships of different\nfeatures are listed in Figure 3.\n3.1\nShort-term Spectral Features\nShort-term spectral features are computed mainly by ap-\nplying the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) on a speech\nsignal [52]. Given a speech signal x(t), it is assumed to be\nquasi-stationary within a short period (e.g. 25ms). The STFT\nof the speech signal x(t) is formulated as follows:\nX(t, \u03c9) = |X(t, \u03c9)| ej\u03d5(\u03c9),\n(4)\nwhere |X(t, \u03c9)| is the magnitude spectrum and \u03d5(\u03c9) is the\nphase spectrum at frame t and frequency bin \u03c9. The power\nspectrum is defined to be |X(t, \u03c9)|2.\nShort-term spectral features are mainly composed of\nshort-term magnitude and phase based features. Usually,\nfew of the magnitude based features are directly derived\nfrom the magnitude spectrum but most of them are derived\nfrom the power spectrum. The phase based features are\nderived from the phase spectrum.\n3.1.1\nShort-term magnitude based features\nThe statistical averaging inherent in parametric modeling\nof the magnitude spectrum may introduce artefacts, such\nas over-smoothed spectral envelopes. The use of magni-\ntude based spectrum can therefore be useful for detecting\ngenerated speech. Short-term magnitude features include\nmagnitude spectrum and power spectrum features.\nMagnitude spectrum features are directly derived from\nthe magnitude spectrum [52], [53]. The logarithm of mag-\nnitude spectrum is called log magnitude spectrum (LMS)\ncontaining the formant information, harmonic structure and\nall the spectral details of speech signal. The logarithmic is\nused to reduce the the dynamic range of the magnitude\nspectrum. Formant information contained in LMS is impor-\ntant for speech recognition but may not be useful for fake\ndetection as most of the fake techniques (e.g. TTS or VC) are\neffective in modelling the formant of speakers. Therefore,\nresidual log LMS (RLMS) is proposed by employing inverse\nlinear predictive coding (LPC) filter to reduce the impact\nof formant information but better analyse the details of\nspectrum such as harmonics.\nPower spectrum features are derived from the power\nspectrum, which may be the most well studied in fake audio\ndetection. They include log power spectrum (LPS), cep-\nstrum (Cep), filter bank based cepstral coefficients (FBCC),\nall-pole modeling based cepstral coefficient (APCC) and\nsubband spectral (SS) features. LPS, commonly called log-\nspectrum, is computed directly on raw power spectrum by\nthe logarithm [54]. Cep is derived from the power spectrum\nby applying discrete cosine transform (DCT). However, the\ndimensionality of LPS and Cep features is too high. FBCC\nfeatures [48] are proposed to address the aforementioned\nissue, and include rectangular filter cepstral coefficients\n(RFCC), linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC), mel\nfrequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), inverted MFCC (IM-\nFCC). RFCC is computed using linear scale rectangular\nfilters. LFCC [55] is extracted with linear triangular filters.\nMFCC [56] is derived from mel scale triangular filters, with\ndenser placement in lower-frequencies to simulate human-\near perception. IMFCC [55] utilizes triangular filters that\nare linearly spaced on inverted-mel scale, giving higher\nemphasis to the high-frequency region. Mel-frequency prin-\ncipal coeffitients (MFPC) features [57] are obtained similarly\nto the MFCC coefficients, but using principal component\nanalysis (PCA) instead of the DCT to reomve the rela-\ntions of the acoustic features. Mel spectrum (Mel spec)\nalso is derived similarly to the MFCC coefficients without\nDCT. LFCC features are well-known, which together with\nGaussian mixture model (GMM) and light convolutional\nneural network (LCNN) are used as the baseline models for\nASVspoof [32] and ADD [33], [34] challenges. APCC fea-\ntures [48] are derived from all-pole modeling representation\nof signal converted to linear prediction cepstral coefficients\n(LPCC) [58]. SS features [48] include subband spectral flux\ncoefficients (SSFC), spectral centroid magnitude coefficients\n(SCMC), subband centroid frequency coefficients (SCFC)\nand discrete Fourier mel subband transform (DF-MST) [59].\nThe subband features mostly extract information such as\nspectral flux and centroid magnitude without looking into\nthe details within each subband.\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n6\nShort-term spectral\nLong-term spectral\nProsodic features\nDeep features\nMagnitude based\nPhase based\nSTFT based\nCQT based\nHT based\nWT based\nPitch\nLearnable spectral\nSupervised embedding\nSelf-supervised embedding\nMagnitude spectrum\nPower spectrum\nLMS [52], RLMS [53]\nLPS [126], Cep [54], LFCC [55], RFCC [48], \nMFCC [56], IMFCC [55], LPCC [58], MFPC [57]\nGD based\nOther phase\nGD [52], MGD [52], MGDCC [60][61]\nIF [53], BPD [52], RPS [63], CosPhase [62]\nModulation\nModSpec [48], Global M [48]\nCQTgram [69], CQCC [70], eCQCC [75],  \nCQTMGD [69]\nMHEC [48]\nMWPC [57], CFCC [77], CFCCIF [77]\nPartially learnable\nFully learnable\nLearned FBCC [84],ConvRBM [85], nnAudio \n[86], FastAudio [88]\nTD-Fbanks [90], SincNet [92], LEAF [51]\nSpoof [96]-[99], Emotion [100], Speaker \n[101], Pronunciation [82]\nWav2vec [106][107], XLS-R [108][109], \nHuBERT [102]\nFeatures\nSDC [48], FDLP [48], LBP [67][68]\n Duration\nEnergy\nOther\nPitch Pattern[61][79], F0 [80],F0 subband [81]\nHuBERT based [82]\nEnergy [82]\nFig. 3. The typical features used in previous studies can be roughly divided into four categories: short-term spectral features, long-term spectral\nfeatures, prosodic features and deep features.\n3.1.2\nShort-term phase based features\nEven though phase information is important in human\nspeech perception, most TTS and VC systems use a simpli-\nfied, minimum phase model which may introduce artefacts\ninto the phase spectrum. Therefore, phase based features\ncan be used to discriminate between human and generated\nspeech. The phase spectrum itself does not have stable\npatterns for fake audio detection due to phase warping [52].\nPost-processing methods are instead utilised to generate\nuseful short-term phase based features including group\ndelay (GD) based and other phase features.\nGD based features involve GD, modified GD (MGD),\nMGD cepstral coefficients (MGDCC) and all-pole group\ndelay (APGD). GD is the derivative of phase spectrum along\nthe frequency axis, which is referred as to a representation of\nfilter phase response. MGD is computed from the spectrum\nafter cepstral smoothing frame-by-frame, which is a varia-\ntion of GD and can extract a more clear phase pattern than\nGD. Xiao et al. [52] use two factors to control the dynamic\nrange of the MGD for anti-spoofing. MGDCC is computed\nfrom the MGD phase spectrum, using both phase and mag-\nnitude information [60], [61]. Wu et al. [62] use MGDCC\nfeatures to distinguish between synthetic speech and hu-\nman speech, which outperform MFCC features. APGD is\na phase-based feature using all-pole modeling, whose role\nin spoofed speech detection is investigated, notably in [48],\nwhich has fewer parameters compared to MGD due to only\nthe all-pole predictor order needing to be optimized.\nOther phase features [52], [53] include instantaneous\nfrequency (IF), baseband phase difference (BPD), relative\nphase shift (RPS), pitch synchronous phase (PSP) and\ncosine-phase (CosPhase) based features. IF features [53] is\nthe derivative of the phase spectrum along the time axis.\nDifferent from the raw phase spectrum that scarcely reflects\nany patterns, the IF spectrum capturing the temporal infor-\nmation of phase has clear patterns. The IF and GD contain\nvery different patterns, which could provide complemen-\ntary information for spoofed speech detection [52]. BPD\nis a phase feature extracted from baseband STFT, which\ncan provide more stable time-derivative phase information\ncompared to the IF. RPS [63] reflects the \u201dphase shift\u201d of har-\nmonic components in relation to the fundamental frequency.\nAnother way to reveal the patterns in phase spectrum is to\nuse pitch synchronous STFT, where the patterns are called\nPSP features [52]. CosPhase features [62] are extracted from\nthe phase spectrum by applying the cosine function to\nunwrapped phase spectrum followed by DCT. In order to\nreduce the dimensionality of CosPhase features, CosPhase\nprincipal coefficients (CosPhasePC) [57] are computed by\nmeans of PCA.\n3.2\nLong-term Spectral Features\nShort-term spectral features are not good at capturing tem-\nporal characteristics of speech feature trajectories due to\nbeing computed in a frame-by-frame fashion [60]. Therefore,\nlong-term spectral features have been proposed to capture\nlong-range information from speech signals, and studies\nhave shown that they are critical to fake speech detec-\ntion [49]. The long-term features can be roughly categorized\ninto four types in terms of time-frequency analysis ap-\nproaches: STFT based features, constant-Q transform (CQT)\nbased features, Hilbert transform (HT) based features and\nwavelet transform (WT) based features.\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n7\n3.2.1\nSTFT based features\nThere are four kinds of STFT based features: modulation\nfeatures, shifted delta coefficients (SDC), frequency domain\nlinear prediction (FDLP) and local binary pattern (LBP)\nfeatures.\nModulation\nfeatures\ninclude\nmodulation\nspectrum\n(ModSpec) and global modulation (Global M). ModSpec\ncontains long-term temporal characteristics of speech sig-\nnal [48]. Global M features combines spectral (e.g. MFCC)\nand temporal modulation information for better long range\nfeature modeling to further improve the performance of\nfake audio detection [64]. SDC captures long-term speech\ninformation and are computed by augmenting delta coeffi-\ncients of multiple speech frames [48]. FDLP is obtained by\nperforming DCT on speech signal using linear prediction\nanalysis performed on different subbands, which are stud-\nied in fake audio detection [48]. LBP features obtain long\nspan information upon spectral features via LBP analysis\nin computer vision tasks [65], [66]. Alegre et al. [67], [68]\nuse uniform LBP analysis to convert LFCC features into a\nso-called textrogram, the histograms of which are used for\nspoof detection.\n3.2.2\nCQT based features\nUnlike short-term spectral features derived from a window\nof tens of milliseconds, the CQT is a long-term window\ntransform. The CQT provides higher frequency resolution at\nlower frequencies, but higher temporal resolution at higher\nfrequencies in contrast to the STFT. The center frequencies\nof each filter and the octaves are geometrically distributed\nfor CQT. Various CQT based features are derived using\nCQT in different ways, which include CQT spectrum, CQ\ncepstral coefficient (CQCC), extended CQCC (eCQCC), in-\nverted CQCC (ICQCC), and CQT-based modified group\ndelay (CQTMGD) etc.\nCQT spectrum is known as CQTgram [69], which is\ncomputed by directly applied the logarithm on raw power\nmagnitude spectrum obtained via CQT [70]. Lavrentyeva el\nal. [71] obtain the best results by using the CQT spectrum\nfor audio replay attack detection of ASVspoof 2017. CQCC\nis obtained from the DCT of the log power magnitude\nspectrum derived by CQT. In 2016, Todisco et al. [70]\nachieved promising performce of detecting unit selection\nTTS based attacks via CQCC features. CQCC features enjoy\nwide usage, including as input features of the baseline\nmodels of ASVspoof and ADD challenges [32], [33]. Over\nhalf of the ASVspoof 2019 participants (26 out of 48) ultilsed\nCQCC features as the input of their classifiers [72], many\nof which obtain top-performing results [73], [74]. eCQCC\nis derived from the combination of coefficients from octave\npower spectrum with the CQCC features that are computed\nfrom linear power spectrum [75]. ICQCC is derived from\nthe inverted linear power spectrum of long-term CQT [76].\nCheng et al. [69] propose to incorporate the CQT and MGD\nfor a more powerful representation of phase-based features\nnamed CQTMGD, which won the 1st place of the ASVspoof\n2019 physical access sub-challenge.\n3.2.3\nHT based features\nHT based features are computed from the analytical signal\nobtained by the HT, such as mean Hilbert envelope coeffi-\ncients (MHEC) [48]. The Hilbert envelope is computed from\neach Gammatone filter output on the signal and a low-pass\nfilter is used for smoothing.\n3.2.4\nWT based features\nWT based features are derived mainly by performing WT on\na speech sigal, which include mel wavelet packet coefficients\n(MWPC), cochlear filter cepstral coefficients (CFCC) and\nCFCC plus instantaneous frequency (CFCCIF).\nMWPC is computed by performing wavelet-packet\ntransform on speech signals. Novoselov et al. [57] applied\nPCA to the log mel scale information to derive 12 coeffi-\ncients, which are called MWPC features. CFCC [77] is de-\nrived based on wavelet transform-like auditory transform,\nthe relevant mechanism of which occurs in the cochlea of\nthe human ear. CFCCIF denotes CFCC plus IF features at\nthe output of each subband filters. The IF and phase of the\nenvelope of the cochlear filter are vital features for speech\nperception of human listeners. TTS and VC models generate\nthe speech in a frame-by-frame pattern. However, human\nspeech production system does not produce speech at frame\nlevel rather in continuum. Therefore, Patel et al. [77] propose\nCFCCIF features with variation capturing across frames to\ndiscriminate the real speech from the spoofed one, which\nwon the best result of ASVspoof 2015.\n3.3\nProsodic Features\nProsody refers to non-segmental information of speech sig-\nnals, including syllable stress, intonation patterns, speaking\nrate and rhythm [78]. Unlike the short-term spectral features\nfrom short duration typically of 20\u201330 ms, it spans over\nlonger segments, such as phones, syllables, words, and\nutterances etc. The important prosodic parameters include\nfundamental frequency (F0), duration (e.g. phone duration,\npause statistics), energy distribution, speaking rate etc. Pre-\nvious studies [78] on fake audio detection mainly consider\nthree major prosodic features: F0, duration and energy.\nThese features are less sensitive to channel effects when\ncompared to spectral features [8]. They can provide com-\nplementary information to spectral features for improving\nthe performance of fake audio detection.\nF0 is also known as pitch. The pitch pattern of synthetic\nspeech is different from that of natural speech [79]. It is\ndifficult for TTS or VC models to precisely model human\nphysiological features required to properly synthesize nat-\nural speech. So synthetic speech has a different mean pitch\nstability than human speech. In addition, co-articulation of\nhuman speech is smoother and more relaxed than that of\nsynthetic speech. This difference is captured by the jitters\nin the pitch pattern of the latter. Therefore, De Leon et\nal. [79] use pitch pattern statistics like mean pitch stability\nderived from image analysis for synthetic speech detection.\nWu et al. [61] introduce pitch pattern calculated by dividing\nthe short-range autocorrelation function for anti-spoofing\nin 2016. Since TTS usually predicts F0 from text resulting\nin unnatural trajectories but VC usually copies a source\nspeaker\u2019s natural F0 trajectories, pitch pattern is more useful\nfor detecting synthetic speech than VC speech, especially\nfor unit selection synthesis attack. In 2018, Pal et al. [80]\nextracted pitch variation at frame-level as complementary\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n8\ninformation to magnitude and phase based features to im-\nprove the performance of synthetic speech detection. How-\never, the distribution of F0 is irregular so that it is difficult to\nuse it directly. In order to address this issue, Xue et al. [81]\npropose a method to capture discriminative features of the\nF0 subband for fake speech detection, which not only uses\nthe F0 information but also spectral features in 2022. How-\never, pitch extraction algorithms are generally unreliable in\nnoisy environments and the extraction of prosodic features\nrequires relatively large amounts of training data due to\ntheir sparsity. Most recently, Wang et al. [82] first try to fuse\nF0, phoneme duration and energy for fake audio detection.\nPhoneme duration features are extracted from a pre-trained\nmodel HuBERT [83] trained using a large amount of speech\ndata.\n3.4\nDeep Features\nThe aforementioned spectral features and prosodic features\nare almost all hand-crafted features have strong and de-\nsirable representation abilities. However, their design is\nflawed by biases due to limitations of handmade represen-\ntations [51]. Therefore, deep features are motivated to fill\nin the gap. Deep features are learned by using deep neural\nnetworks, which can be roughly categorized into: learnable\nspectral features, supervised embedding features and self-\nsupervised embedding features.\n3.4.1\nLearnable spectral features\nLearnable spectral features involve using learnable neural\nlayers to estimate the standard filtering process, which can\nbe categorized in terms of the procedures they perform:\npartially and fully learnable spectral features.\nPartially learnable spectral features are extracted by\ntraining a neural network based filterbank matrix with a\nspectrogram obtained by applying STFT on a speech sig-\nnal. In 2017, Hong et al. [84] developed deep neural net-\nwork (DNN) filter bank cepstral coefficients (FBCC) named\nlearned FBCC, to distinguish natural speech from spoofed\none. The learned FBCC can capture better differences be-\ntween real and synthetic speech than most hand-crafted\nFBCC, especially for detecting unseen attacks. Sailor et al.\n[85] propose a method to learn filterbank representation\nusing convolutional restricted boltzmann machine named\nConvRBM features. In 2020, Cheuk et al. [86] presented\na neural network-based audio processing toolkit named\nnnAudio, which uses 1D convolutional neural networks to\ntransform audio signal from time domain to frequency do-\nmain [87]. This toolkit on make the waveform-to-spectram\ntransformation layer trainable via back-propagation. How-\never, Fu et al. [88] report that nnAudio based anti-spoof\nmethods obtain limited improvement due to the fact that\nnnAudio is implemented by a set of unconstrained learn-\nable filterbanks. Zhang et al. [89] use a neural network to\nlearn the frequency centre, bandwidth, gain, and shape of\nthe filter banks performing different constraints to extract\nfeatures. Fu et al. [88] propose a front-end named FastAudio\nwhose input is a spectrogram of the STFT. The learnable\nlayer of FastAudio is instead of replacing fixed filterbanks\nby performing filterbank shape constraints for anti-spoofing\ntasks.\nFully learnable spectral features are learned directly\nfrom raw waveforms to approximate the standard filtering\nprocess. They are different from partially learnable spectral\nfeatures extracted by training a filterbank matrix with a\nspectrogram. Zeghidour et al. [90] propose time-domain\nfilterbanks (TD-FBanks) via scattering transform approxi-\nmation of mel-filterbanks [91]. The TD-FBanks are learned\nwithout any constraints to approximate mel-filterbanks at\ninitialization. SincNet [92] is proposed to learn a convolution\nwith sine cardinal filters, a non-linearity and a max-pooling\nlayer, as well as a variant using Gabor filters [93]. Tak\net al [94] use SincNet as the first layer of the end-to-end\nanti-spoofing model called RawNet2. In 2021, Zeghidour et\nal. [51] designed a new learnable filtering layer with Gabor\nfilters called LEAF, which can be used as a drop-in substitute\nof mel-filterbanks. Unlike Sinc filters that require using a\nwindow function [92], Gabor filters are optimally localized\nin time and frequency domain. Tomilov et al. [95] obtain\npromising results by using LEAF features for detecting\nreplay attacks of ASVspoof 2021 [32].\n3.4.2\nSupervised embedding features\nSupervised embedding features involve the extraction of\ndeep embeddings from deep neural networks via super-\nvised training. There are about four kinds of supervised\nembedding features for audio deepfake detection: spoof\nembeddings, emotion embeddings, speaker embedings and\npronunciation embeddings.\nSpoof embeddings are extracted from a neural network\nbased model trained on the bonafide and spoofed data.\nChen et al. [96] use a DNN based model to compute ro-\nbust and abstract feature representation for spoofed speech\ndetection in ASVspoof 2015 challenge. Qian et al. [97] extract\nsequence-level bottleneck features, named s-vector, from\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) models for anti-spoofing.\nDas et al. [49] train a deep feature extractor using a DNN\nmodel with LPS features in 2019. The spoof embeddings are\ncomputed from the feature extractor by removing the output\nlayer. In order to learn sequence contextual information\nfor fake audio detection, Alejandro et al. [98] propose a\nlight convolutional gated RNN to learn utterance-level deep\nembeddings, which are then used as the inputs of the back-\nend classification. Most recently, Doan et al. [99] use RNN,\nconvolutional sequence-to-sequence and transformer based\nencoder to learn breathing and talking sounds as well as\nsilence in an audio clip for deepfake detection.\nEmotion embeddings are learned using a supervised\nspeech emotion recognition model trained with emotion\nlabelled data. The emotion embeddings are directly used to\ndetect fake utterances. Conti et al. [100] proposed a method\nto detect fake speech via emotion recognition in 2022. The\nrationale behind this method is that the emotional behavior\nof the generated audio is not natural like that of real human\nspeech. The results in [100] show that the method can\ngeneralize well in cross-dataset scenarios.\nSpeaker embeddings are trained using a supervised\nspeaker recognition model using training data with speaker\nidentity label. The speaker embeddings are used as auxiliary\nfeatures to improve the performance of fake audio detection.\nIn 2022, Pan et al. [101] joinly train a speaker recognition\nmodel and a fake audio detection model via multi-objective\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n9\nlearning. The speaker embeddings and LFCC features are\nboth used as the input features of fake audio detection\nmodel.\nPronunciation embeddings are extracted from a speech\nrecognition model trained with labelled data. The pronun-\nciation embeddings can be directly used to discriminate the\nreal speech from the fake one. In 2023, Wang et al. [82] fuse\npronunciation embeddings and prosodic features to train a\nfake audio detection model. The pronunciation embeddings\nare computated from a pretrained conformer-based speech\nrecognition model.\n3.4.3\nSelf-supervised embedding features\nAlthough supervised embedding features are well general-\nized to unknown conditions, they are learnt using a plentiful\nsupply of labeled training data [102]. However, obtaining\nannotated speech data or fake utterances is costly and\ntechnically demanding. This motivates researchers to ex-\ntract deep embedding features from self-supervised speech\nmodel trained using any bona fide speech data. Despite\ntraining an effective self-supervised model costly, there are\na number of pre-trained self-supervised speech models are\npublicly available, such as Wav2vec [103], [104], XLS-R [105]\nand HuBERT [83].\nWav2vec based features are extracted from the pre-\ntrained Wav2vec or Wav2vec2.0 models. Xie et al. [106]\npropose a Siamese neural network based representation\nlearning model to distinguish real and fake speech in 2021.\nThe model is trained with the wav2vec features extracted\nfrom a pretrained Wav2vec model. Tak et al. [107] use self-\nsupervised learning in the form of a Wav2vec2.0 front-end\nwith fine tuning for fake audio detection in 2022. Although\nthe pretrained Wav2vec2.0 is trained using only genuine\nspeech data without any fake audio, they obtain the state-\nof-the-art results reported in the literature for both the\nASVspoof 2021 LA and Deepfake datasets.\nXLS-R based features are extracted from the pre-\ntrained XLS-R models which is a variant of Wav2vec2.0.\nMartin-Donas [108] utilize deep features extracted from pre-\ntrained XLS-R [105], which is a large-scale model for cross-\nlingual speech representation learning based on a pretrained\nWav2vec2.0. The method ranked first in the LF track of ADD\n2022 challenge [33], where the utterances are interfered\nwith various noises. Lv et al. [109] use a self-supervised\nmodel XLS-R as a feature extractor for fake audio detection.\nThe features generalize well for unknown partially fake\nvoices and obtain the best results of PF task of ADD 2022\ncompetition [33].\nHuBERT based features are extracted from the pre-\ntrained HuBERT models. Wang et. [82] use a pre-trained\nHuBERT [83] model to extract the duration encoding vector\nfor audio deepfake detection. The encoding vector is an\nencoding similar to speech phonemes. Wang et al. [102]\ndirectly use the embeddings from the pre-trained HuBERT\nas the input features of the detection models.\nWang et al. [102] also investigate the performance\nof spoof speech detection using embedding features ex-\ntracted from different pre-trained self-supervised models,\ne.g. Wav2vec2.0, XLS-R and HuBERT, providing some useful\nfindings in [102]. If the pre-trained model is not fine-tuned\nwith target data, the classifier needs to be deep for the anti-\nspoofing models. However, a simple neural network with\njust an average temporal pooling and linear layer is suffi-\ncient when the pre-trained model is fine-tuned with anti-\nspoofing data. Learning deep embedding features using\nself-supervised training is suggested as a potential direction\nto improve the generalization of fake audio detection.\n4\nCLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS\nThe back-end classifier is also very important for audio\ndeepfake detection, which aims to learn high-level feature\nrepresentation of the front-end input features and model\nexcellent discrimination capabilities. The classification algo-\nrithms are mainly divided into two categories: traditional\nand deep learning classification.\n4.1\nTraditional Classification\nMany classic pattern classification approaches have been\nemployed to detect fake speech, including logistic regres-\nsion (LR) [137], [138], probabilistic linear discriminant anal-\nysis (PLDA) [114], [139], random forest (RF) [114], gradient\nboosting decision Tree (GBDT) [114], extreme learning ma-\nchine (ELM) [140], k-nearest neighbor (KNN) [138] and so\non. The most widely used classifiers are the support vector\nmachine (SVM) [141] and GMM [142].\n4.1.1\nSVM based classifiers\nOne of the extensively used traditional classifiers in pre-\nvious early work for spoofing audio detetion is SVM due\nto its excellent classification capabilities. Alegre et al. [110]\nsuggest that SVM classifiers are inherently robust to artificial\nsignal spoofing attacks. However, it is very difficult to know\nthe exact nature of spoofing attacks in practical scenarios.\nTherefore, Alegre et al. [68] and Villalba et al. [111] propose\na one-class SVM classifier only trained using genuine ut-\nterances to classify real and fake voices, which generalizes\nwell to unknown spoof attacks. Hanilc\u00b8i et al. [143] use i-\nvectors as the input features of SVM to discriminate the real\nutterance from the fake one.\n4.1.2\nGMM based classifiers\nAnother conventional classifier well-known as GMM is\nwidely used in fake audio detection as it is an effective\ngenerative model employed as the baseline model in a series\nof competitions, such as ASVspoof 2017 [30], 2019 [117],\n2021 [32] and ADD 2022 [33]. Amin et al. [112] train a\nGMM classifier fed with MFCC features to detect voice\ndisguise from speech variability. De Leon et al. [79] use\na GMM classification to discriminate between human and\nsynthetic voices. Wu et al. [144] propose a method which\ndecided between real and converted speech by using log-\nscale likelihood ratio based upon the GMM model for real\nand converted speech. Sizov et al. [113] use i-vectors trained\nwith GMM mean supervector to jointly perform VC attacks\ndetection and speaker verification obtaining promising per-\nformance. Many participants of ASVspoof 2015 and 2017\nhave obtained promising performance by adopting GMM\nfor classifying genuine and spoofed speech [114]. Sahidullah\net al. [48] choose GMM classifiers for benchmarking of\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n10\nTABLE 4\nComparison of representative audio deepfake detection classifications\nAlgorithm\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nTraditional\nSVM [68], [110], [111]\nEarly work, excellent classification capabilities\nRestricted by the limited training samples\nClassification\nGMM [79], [112]\u2013[115]\nMost widely used baseline\nPerformance needs to be further improved\nCNN based\nLCNN [7], [33], [74], [116]\u2013[118]\nEasier to benchmark due to popularity\nDeeper networks are difficult to train and result\nin performance degradation\nResNet [95], [119]\u2013[121]\nAvoiding performance degradation\nLimitted generalizabilities to unseen fake attacks\nResNet based\nAFN [122]\nEnhances feature representations\nin both the frequency and time domains\nOut-of-domain generalizabilities should be improved\nRes2Net based\nRes2Net [123], [124]\nEnlarging the receptive fields and improve the\ngeneralization to unseen fake utterance\nNot considering channel relationship\nSENet [125], [126]\nModelling interdependencies between channels\nDeeper networks are difficult to train and result in\nperformance degradation\nSENet based\nASSERT [127]\nCombining SENet and ResNet, achieving better\nperformance\nNot learning the relationships between\nneighbouring sub-bands or segment\nGNN based\nGAT [128]\nModelling relationships between temporal\nsegments or spectral sub-bands\nNot automatically optimize network architectures\nDeep Learning\nClassification\nDARTS based\nPC-DARTS [129]\nLittle human effort, automatically optimizes the\noperations in network architecture blocks\nDifficult to train\nCNN based\nCRNNSpoof [130]\nEarly end-to-end work\nfor audio deepfake detection\nPerformance need be improved\nRawNet2 [94], [131]\nWidely used end-to-end model\nNot optimize the parameters of the Sinc-conv during\ntraining\nRawNet2 based\nTO-RawNet [132]\nReducing the correlation between filters in the\nSinc-conv\nNot learning adjacent temporal relationships\nRawGAT-ST [133]\nData boosting and augmentation technique\nwith spectro-temporal GAT\nNot considering two heterogeneous graphs via a\nheterogeneous attention mechanism\nGNN based\nAASIST [134]\nModelling artefacts spanning temporal and spectral\nsegments with a heterogeneous attention mechanism\nUnreliably for unknown fake attacks\nDARTS based\nRaw PC-DARTS [135]\nLittle human effort\ndirectly upon the raw speech\nNot easy to train\nRawformer [136]\nUse positional-related local and global dependency\nfor synthetic speech detection\nAcquire local dependency not well\nEnd-to-End\nModel\nTransformer based\nSE-Rawformer [136]\nUsing squeeze-and-excitation operation\nto acquire local dependency\nComputation costly\nvarious features as it yields reasonably good accuracy in\nthe ASVspoof 2015 dataset. In addition, Todisco et al. [115]\nuse GMM in a standard 2-class classifier in which the classes\ncorrespond to genuine and spoofed speech.\n4.2\nDeep Learning Classification\nThe back-end classifications of the latest fake audio de-\ntection systems are mostly based on deep learning meth-\nods, which significantly outperform the SVM and GMM\nbased classifiers due to their powerful modelling capabil-\nities [145]. The model architectures of back-end classifica-\ntion are generally based on convolutional neural network\n(CNN), deep residual network (ResNet), modified ResNet\n(Res2Net), squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENet), graph\nneural network (GNN), differentiable architecture search\n(DARTS) and Transformer.\n4.2.1\nCNN based classifiers\nSince CNNs are good at capturing spatially-local correla-\ntion, CNN based classifiers have achieved promising per-\nformance [116], such as light CNN (LCNN) [146] consisting\nof convolutional and max-pooling layers with Max-Feature-\nMap (MFM) activation. LCNN is used as the baseline model\nof the ASVspoof [117] and ADD [33] competitions. The best\nsystem in ASVspoof 2017 [69] and the best single system in\nthe LA task of ASVspoof 2019 [74] are also utilize LCNN\nfor fake audio detection. The MFM activation of LCNN not\nonly filters the noise effects (ambient noise, signal distortion,\netc.), retains the core information, but also reduces the\ncomputational cost and storage space. Zeinali et al. [118] use\nVGG-like network comprising several convolutional and\npooling layers followed by a statistics pooling and several\ndense layers to detect fake utterances. Wu et al. [7] propose\na feature genuinization transformer with CNN trained only\nusing genuine speech, and the outputs of this transformer\nare then fed into the LCNN based classifier.\n4.2.2\nResNet based classifiers\nAlthough deep CNNs have achieved promising results for\nfake audio detection, deeper neural networks are more diffi-\ncult to train and result in performance degradation. In order\nto address this problem, ResNet [147] is introduced as the\nclassifier [119], employing a residual mapping. Tomilov et\nal. [95] and Chen et al. [120] both use ResNet as the classifier\nfor audio deepfake detection and achieve promising results\nin the deepfake task of ASVspoof 2021. Yan et al. [148] em-\nploy a standard 34-layer ResNet with multi-head attention\npooling layer for detecting deepfake audio, ranking in the\nfirst place in the FG-D task of the ADD 2022. Lai et al. [122]\npropose a ResNet-based classifier named Attentive Filtering\nNetwork (AFN) to further improve the performance. AFN is\nbased on dilated residual network, using convolution layers\ninstead of fully connected layers, and modifying the resid-\nual units by adding a dilation factor. A light ResNet based\nfake audio detection system is introduced by Parasu et al.\n[121], reducing network parameters to prevent overfitting.\nKwak et al. [149] introduce a compact network ResMax\ncombining MFM activation and ResNet for improving the\nperformance of spoofed audio detection system.\n4.2.3\nRes2Net based classifiers\nAlthough ResNet based models have strong ability to cap-\nture fake cues, their generalizabilities to unseen fake attacks\nare still limited. Therefore, Li et al. [123] propose the incor-\nporation of Res2Net in fake audio detection systems, where\nthe feature maps within one ResNet block are splitted into to\nmultiple channel groups linking by a residual-like connec-\ntion. The connection of Res2Net enlarges the receptive fields\nand improve the generalization to unseen fake utterances.\nKim et al. [124] utilize Res2Net and Phase network, fed with\nphase and magnitude features, for detecting fake audio.\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n11\n4.2.4\nSENet based classifiers\nConvolution operators of CNN aim to fuse both spatial\nand channel-wise information within local receptive fields\nat each layer, not considering channel relationship. Hu et\nal. [125] and Zhang et al. [126] propose a focus Squeeze-\nand-Excitation network (SENet) adaptively modelling inter-\ndependencies between channels. Lai et al. [127] use SENet\nto train one of the fake audio detection models. Further-\nmore, they propose a system named Anti-Spoofing with\nSqueeze-Excitation and Residual neTworks (ASSERT) com-\nbining SENet and ResNet. The ASSERT are ranked as one\nof the top performing systems in the two sub-challenges\nin ASVspooof 2019. Wu et al. [150] use SENet with self-\nattention layer to detect partially fake audio, achieving top\nperformance in ADD 2022 challenge. Xue et al. [151] utilize\nSENet with efficient channel attention via self-distillation for\nfake speech detection.\n4.2.5\nGNN based classifiers\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) [152], like graph attention\nnetwork (GAT) or graph convolutional network (GCN), are\nused to learn underlying relationships among data. The fake\nartefacts used to detect spoofing attacks are often located in\nspecific temporal segments or spectral sub-bands. However,\nthe aforementioned studies do not focus on learning the\nrelationships between neighbouring sub-bands or segments.\nTak et al. [128] use a GAT to model these relationships to\nimprove the performance of fake audio detection systems.\nMore recently, Chen et al. [153] utilize GCN incorporat-\ning prior knowledge to learn spectro-temporal dependency\ninformation for anti-spoofing, which achieves promising\nperformance on the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset.\n4.2.6\nDARTS based classifiers\nA particular variant of neural architecture search known\nas differentiable architecture search (DARTS) [154], auto-\nmatically optimizes the operations contained within archi-\ntecture blocks, including convolutional, pooling, residual\nconnections operations. Ge et al. [129] introduce a variant of\nDARTS known as partial channel connections (PC-DARTS)\nfor audio deepfake detection. The PC-DARTS based model,\nwith little human effort and containing 85% fewer parame-\nters than a Res2Net model, obtains competitive results com-\npared to the best performing systems in previous studies.\nWang et al. [155] propose a light DARTS, which combines\nDARTS with MFM activation, playing the role of feature\nselection.\n4.2.7\nTransformer based classifiers\nDifferent from the fully fake utterances, the partially fake\nutterances contains some discontinuity artifacts between\nconcatenated audio clips. Transformer is good at modelling\nlocal and global artifacts and relationship. So Cai et al. [156]\nuse Transformer and ResNet-1D as the backend classifier to\ndetect partially fake audio and locate the fake regions.\n5\nEND-TO-END MODELS\nThe aforementioned methods to audio deepfake detection\nhave focused on the design of machine learning based\nclassifiers fed with hand-crafted or learnable features. Al-\nthough past literature [74], [123], [128], [157] shows that\nthe use of well-designed classifier usually leads to better\nperforming models, the performance of a given classifier\ncan vary greatly when combined with different features. In\nrecent years, deep neural network based approaches that\nintegrate feature extraction and classification in an end-\nto-end manner have achieved competitive performance,\nwhere both the feature extractor and the classifier are jointly\noptimized directly upon the raw speech waveform. The\nend-to-end models avoid limitations introduced from the\nuse of knowledge-based features and are optimized for the\napplication rather than generic decompositions [94]. The\nend-to-end architectures of audio deepfake detection can be\nroughly classified into four types: CNN, RawNet2, ResNet,\nGNN, DARTS and Transformer.\n5.1\nCNN based models\nSome researchers attempt the CNN based models to end-\nto-end fake audio detection. Muckenhirn et al. [158] em-\nployed a simple CNN-based end-to-end approach to de-\ntection spoofed attacks. The proposed model consists of a\nsingle convolution layer and a multilayer perceptron (MLP)\nlayer, which performs well for VC and TTS attacks. A\nraw waveform convolutional long short term neural net-\nwork (CLDNN) based anti-spoofing method is proposed by\nDinkel et al. [159]. The CLDNN model employs time- and\nfrequency-convolutional layers to reduce time and spectral\nvariations, as well as long-term temporal memory layers to\nmodel long-term temporal information. In 2020, Chintha\net al. [130] proposed a convolution-recurrent neural net-\nwork for spoofing detection named CRNNSpoof, which is\ncomposed of five 1-D convolution layers, a bidirectional\nLSTM layer and two fully-connected layers. However, the\naforementioned models do not perform well in cross-dataset\nevaluation. In order to alleviate this issue, Hua et al. [160]\npropose a time-domain synthetic speech section net, called\nTSSDNet, including Inception parallel convolutions struc-\ntures named Inc-TSSDNet. The proposed model has promis-\ning generalization capability to unseen datasets.\n5.2\nRawNet2 based models\nMotivated by the power of RawNet2 in text-independent\nspeaker verification [161], Tak et al. [94] employ RawNet2 to\nanti-spoofing. RawNet2 is a convolutional neural network\nwith residual blocks, the first layer of which has a bank\nof sinc-shaped filters, which is essentially the same as that\nof SincNet [92]. RawNet2 operates directly on raw audio\nthrough time-domain convolution and has potential to learn\ncues that are not detectable using knowledge-based meth-\nods. Wang et al. [131] use RawNet2 with weighted additive\nangular margin loss for fake audio detection. However,\nRawNet2 does not optimize the parameters of the Sinc-Conv\nlayer during training, limiting its performance. In order\nto alleviate this problem, Wang et al. [132] propose TO-\nRawNet to improve its discriminability, which incorporates\northogonal convolution into RawNet2 reducing the correla-\ntion between filters in the sinc-conv. TO-RawNet based fake\naudio detection models observably outperform RawNet2\nbased models.\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n12\n5.3\nResNet based models\nDeeper neural network with residual mapping named\nResNet become easy to train and achieve promising per-\nformance. Hua et al. [160] propose a TSSDNet with resid-\nual skip connection named Res-TSSDNet, obtaining better\nperformance. Ma et al. [162] propose a speech anti-spoofing\nmodel named RW-ResNet composed of Conv1D Resblocks\nand backbone ResNet34.\n5.4\nGNN based models\nInspired by the success of GAT to model complicated rela-\ntionships among graph representations [128], Tak et al. [133]\npropose a spectro-temporal GAT named RawGAT-ST, which\nlearns the relationship, outperforming the RawNet2 and\nRes-TSSDNet on the LA evaluation set of ASVspoof 2019.\nHowever, the RawGAT-ST consists of a pair of parallel\ngraphs to combine information by employing element-wise\nmultiplication to the two graphs. In fact, it will be beneficial\nto combine the two heterogeneous graphs via a hetero-\ngeneous attention mechanism. Therefore, Jung et al. [134]\npropose a heterogeneous stacking graph attention layer to\nmodel artefacts spanning temporal and spectral segments\nwith a heterogeneous attention mechanism, named AASIST.\nThe AASIST outperforms the current state-of-the-art end-\nto-end models. Furthermore, a proposed lightweight vari-\nant called AASIST-L obtains competing performances [134].\nThese methods perform reliably under seen encoding and\ntransimission conditions but unreliably for unknown tele-\nphony scenarios. In order to alleviate the problem, Tak et al.\n[166] propose a model based on RawGAT-ST and RawNet2\nsystems, named RawBoost, which is a data boosting and\naugmentation technique based upon the combination of\nlinear and non-linear convolutive noises as well as im-\npulsive and stationary additive noises that can be applied\ndirectly to raw audio. In addition, the AASIST does not\noptimize the parameters of the sinc-conv during training,\nwhich limited its performance. Therefore, Wang et al. [132]\nemploy orthogonal regularization in the Sinc-conv layer of\nthe AASIST, which is called Orth-AASIST, outperforming\nthe AASIST based model.\n5.5\nDARTS based models\nThe aforementioned end-to-end methods are encouraging\nand promising. However, they can only automatically learn\nfeatures and network parameters rather than network archi-\ntecture. Therefore, Ge et al. [135] try to employ an automatic\napproach, which not only operates directly upon the raw\nspeech signal but also jointly optimizes of both the net-\nwork architecture and network parameters. The appoarch is\nimplemented based upon partially-connected differentiable\narchitecture search from the raw audio waveform (Raw PC-\nDARTS).\n5.6\nTransformer based models\nIn order to modelling local and global artefacts and relation-\nship directly on raw audio, Liu et al. [136] propose a model\nnamed Rawformer composed of convolution layer and\ntransformer to detect fake utterances. The Rawformer gen-\neralizes better than the AASIST on cross-dataset evaluation.\nLiu et al. [136] also propose a squeeze-and-excitation Raw-\nformer called SE-Rawformer using squeeze-and-excitation\noperation to acquire local dependency, which outperforms\nthe Rawformer.\n6\nGENERALIZATION METHODS\nAlthough most of the existing audio deepfake detection\nmethods have achieved impressive performance in in-\ndomain test, their performance drops sharply when dealing\nwith out-of-domain dataset in real-life scenarios [167]\u2013[169].\nIn other words, the generalization ability of audio deepfake\ndetection systems is still poor. Several attempts have been\nmade to try to tackle this challenge from different perspec-\ntives, such as loss function and continual learning.\n6.1\nLoss Function\nIt has become increasingly challenging to improve the gen-\neralization ability of audio deepfake detection systems to\nunknown attacks. In order to overcome this problem, Chen\net al. [169] ensure the neural network to learn more robust\nfeature embeddings using large margin cosine loss (LMCL)\nfunction and online frequency masking augmentation. The\ngeneralization ability of detection models is increased by\nusing LMCL and applying data augmentation. Zhang et\nal. [170] use one-class learning to deal with unknown fake\nattacks, the key idea of which is to construct a compact\nrepresentation of genuine audio representation and utilize\nan angular margin to separate the fake utterances in the\nembedding space. This method outperforms all previous\nexisting single systems on the evaluation set of the LA\ntask in ASVspoof 2019 challenge, without any data aug-\nmentation methods. These methods address the difficulties,\nto some degree, in detecting unknown attacks in practical\nuse. However, the compactness of bona fide utterances in\nthe embedding space lacks consideration of the diversity of\nspeakers. Ding et al. [171] propose speaker attractor multi-\ncenter one-class learning (SAMO) to address the problem.\nThe core idea of the SAMO is that real utterances are\nclustered around a number of speaker attractors and the\nmethod pushes away fake voices from all the attractors in a\nhigh-dimensional embedding space.\n6.2\nContinual Learning\nContinual learning focuses on the continuous training and\nadaptation of models on new information, aiming to over-\ncome catastrophic forgetting existing in fine-tuning. In order\nto improve the performance to unseen deepfake audio, Ma\net al. [172] propose a regularization based continual learning\nmethod, named Detecting Fake Without Forgetting (DFWF),\nto make the model learn new fake attacks incrementally.\nThis method doesn\u2019t need to access old data but can ensure\nthe model remember previous information. It also improves\nthe detection performance on the new dataset and over-\ncomes catastrophic forgetting by introducing regularization.\nHowever, the approximation of the DFWF may result in\nerror accumulation in continual learning, leading to de-\nteriorating learning performance. Most recently, Zhang et\nal. [173] propose a continual learning algorithm for fake\naudio detection to solve this problem, called regularized\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n13\nTABLE 5\nFeatures and classifiers of the top-3 submitted systems for each task in ASVspoof and ADD competitions.

All of these systems\nuse some form of data augmentation in their training,\nthough no common form can be identified. Most are en-\nsemble systems, and most operate upon short-term spectral\nfeatures or raw waveforms. Most use a ResNet classifier\nor a variant thereof, with other types of convolutional\nnetworks also being popular. Fusion strategies employed\nin these methods include weighted averaging, using either\nuniformly or empirically set weights.\nThe systems generally rely on spectral features, espe-\ncially in older iterations of the ASVspoof challenge. Re-\ncently, features derived from pre-trained models such as\nWav2vec2.0 or XLS-R, have also seen much usage, with\nconsiderable success, as evidenced by their use in the top-\nperforming systems in the ADD competitions.\nIn terms of classifiers, both traditional classifiers (e.g.,\nSVMs and GMMs) and deep learning networks have been\nused in the top-performing systems. The top-performing\nsystems in the ASVspoof competitions have used GMMs,\nSVMs, and ResNet classifiers, while the top-performing\nsystems in the ADD competitions have used ResNet, LCNN\nand AASIST classifiers.\nWhile superficially the performances seem to be decreas-\ning, as seen from the increase in EER, this is likely due to the\nincreasing difficulty of the tasks rather than a decrease in\nperformance. In the competitions, the top-performing sys-\ntems have consistently outperformed the baseline systems\nby a solid margin.\n7.2\nEvaluation of Features\nWe evaluate the discriminative performance of different\nhandcrafted features in fake audio detection. The features\ninclude short-time spectral features (MFCC, LPS, LFCC,\nIMFCC), long-time spectral feature (CQCC), prosodic fea-\ntures (F0, energy, duration) and self-supervised embedded\nfeature (XLS-R). We also include features resulting from\nconcatenation of prosody features and LFCC or XLS-R. In\nthis group of the experiments, we choose GMM, LCNN and\nASSERT classifiers due to their popularity and effectiveness\nin fake audio detection tasks.\nFor the extraction of the short-time spectral features, we\nrefer to the setups in the baseline systems. We then take the\nfirst- and second-order differences. For LFCC3 and CQCC4,\nwe follow the default setup in the baseline systems. The\nLPS [126] features are extracted with Blackman windows in\nSTFT using the audio processing toolkit5.\nFor prosodic features, we use the Yet Another Algorithm\nfor Pitch Tracking method (YAPPT) [174] to extract the F0\nfeatures (A). The window length is set to be 25 ms with a\nwindow shift of 10 ms to extract the energy features (B). For\nduration features (C), we follow the setup of the HuBERT\nbased duration method [82].\nWe\nemploy\na\nvariant\nof\nWav2vec2.0,\nknown\nas\n\u201cWav2vec2.0 XLS-R6\u201d, to extract the XLS-R features. The\nmodel is pretrained on a dataset with 53 languages and\n56 thousand hours of audio, and incorporates more linear\ntransformations and a larger context network. A 10 ms\naudio segment is transformed to a 1024-dimensional vector\nfor the pretrained model.\nFor\nour\nclassifiers,\nthe\nGMM7\nmodel\nperforms\nbinary\nclassification\nbased\non\na\nrandomly-initialized\n3. https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021/tree/main/LA/\nBaseline-LFCC-LCNN\n4. https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021/tree/main/LA/\nBaseline-CQCC-GMM\n5. https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.stft.html\n6. https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/\nexamples/wav2vec/xlsr\n7. https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n14\nTABLE 6\nThe performance of representative features is evaluated using the\ndetection models trained with the training set of ASVspoof 2021 in\nterms of the EER (%).

The LCNN8 backend classifier is\nbased on [31], but includes an LSTM layer and average\npooling. The ASSERT9 classifier is based on [127].\nWith the aforementioned set of systems, we perform two\nsets of experiments. In the first set, we train the classifiers\non the ASVspoof 2021 DF task training set, and evaluate\nthem on the ASVspoof 2021 DF task test set and the In-the-\nWild test set.

Notably, the XLS-R features and the concatenated\nfeatures (A + B + C + XLS-R) as well as LFCC achieve\nconsistent and competitive performance in both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations.\n7.3\nEvaluation of Classifiers\nFollowing the previous evaluations of discriminative fea-\ntures, we also evaluate the performances of different back-\nend classifiers and end-to-end models. We choose the GMM,\nLCNN, ResNet, ASSERT, Res2Net, AFN and GAT classifiers\ndue to their popularity and effectiveness in fake audio\ndetection tasks. Owing to the effectiveness of the XLS-R\nfeatures and LFCC, we evaluate the classifiers on these two\nfeatures.\nThe GMM, LCNN and ASSERT classifiers are configured\nas described in the previous section. The ResNet classifier\nis a ResNet-34 model. The Res2Net10, AFN11, GRU12 and\nGAT13 classifiers are based on the open-source implemen-\ntations. In training, we use the Adam optimizer with a\nlearning rate of 5 \u00d7 10\u22125; the models are trained for 200\nepochs with a batch size of 32. The results are shown in\nTables 8 and 9.\nAs seen in Table 8, the AFN and GAT classifiers perform\nvery well under in-distribution conditions, with the lowest\n10. https://github.com/lixucuhk/ASV-anti-spoofing-with-Res2Net\n11. https://github.com/jefflai108/Attentive-Filtering-Network\n12. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GRU.html\n13. https://github.com/TakHemlata/SSL Anti-spoofing\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n15\nTABLE 10\nThe performance of end-to-end models is evaluated using the detection\nmodels in terms of the EER (%).

This shows that deep convolutional models with pre-\ntrained model features are effective when the testing data is\nin-distribution. However, the performance of the classifiers\ndegrades significantly when there is a discrepancy between\nthe distributions of the training and testing data. This is\nespecially evident in the performance of the GAT classifier,\nwhich shows a 10% increase in EER when evaluated on the\nIn-the-Wild test set. This suggests that the classifiers are not\nas robust to out-of-distribution evaluations.\nThis is further evidenced by the results in Table 9, where\nthe classifiers are evaluated on the ADD 2023 FG-D task\ntest set and the In-the-Wild test set. The classifiers show\na significant increase in EER when evaluated on the In-\nthe-Wild test set, which is of a different language from\nthe training dataset. This suggests that the classifiers are\nnot robust to out-of-distribution evaluations, and that the\nperformance of the classifiers degrades significantly when\nthe testing data is out-of-distribution.\n7.4\nEnd-to-End Models\nWe evaluate the performances of different end-to-end mod-\nels like RawNet2, AASIST end-to-end models due to their\npopularity and effectiveness in fake audio detection tasks.\nRawNet214, ASIST15 end-to-end models are based on the\nopen-source codes. In training, we use the Adam optimizer\nwith a learning rate of 5 \u00d7 10\u22125; the models are trained for\n200 epochs with a batch size of 32.\nTable 10 shows the performance of the end-to-end mod-\nels, which are trained on the ASVspoof 2021 DF task training\nset as well as the ADD 2023 FG-D task training set, and\nevaluated on the ASVspoof 2021 DF task test set, the ADD\n2023 FG-D task test set, and the In-the-Wild test set. The\nresults obtained from models trained on the ASVspoof\ndataset show that the end-to-end models perform well un-\nder in-distribution conditions, with the lowest EER of 19%\u2013\n25%. However, the performance of the end-to-end models\ndegrades when evaluated on the In-the-Wild test set, with\nthe EER increasing by 10%\u201315%.\nOn the other hand, the models trained on the ADD 2023\ndataset perform better on In-the-Wild, due to the difference\nbetween the ADD 2023 training and testing sets in terms\nof audio quality and perturbations, possibly resulting in\ngreater distribution differences. Overall, these results sug-\ngest that the addressing of this issue is a promising direction\nfor future research.\n14. https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/2021/tree/main/LA/\nBaseline-RawNet2\n15. https://github.com/clovaai/aasist\n8\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nAlthough some significant progress on audio deepfake de-\ntection have been made over the last decade, there still\nexist some limitations which should be addressed in future\nwork. Some potential research directions are summarized as\nfollows.\nCollecting audio datasets in the wild: Most of the audio\ndeepfake detection datasets are not collected in the wild,\nwhich do not quite match with the real utterances recorded\nor generated in realistic conditions. The real conditions of\nthe utterances may be even worse and vary more greatly\nthan the simulated conditions. In order to assess audio\ndeepfake detection methods in practical applications, the\nutterances with a variety of channels or conditions should\nbe collected through realistic environment conditions, such\nas social media platforms, Internet or telephone channels.\nDesigning large-scale multilingual datasets: Previous\ndatasets are mainly single language based and most of\nthem are English deepfake audio datasets and few of them\nare other language datasets, e.g. Chinese or Japanese. It\nmay make the detection methods language dependent. But\nit is necessary to build language independent detection\nsystems in realistic applications. In order to make fake\ndetection systems more robust for other languages, we need\nto evaluate the performance of fake detection models in\nthe cross language scenario and for code-switching between\ndifferent languages. Therefore, it is important to design and\ndevelop large-scale multilingual datasets on audio deepfake\ndetection in the wild.\nImproving generalization ability and robustness of\ndetection models: Although previous studies have made\na lot of attempts on audio deepfake detection and achieved\npromising performance, the generalization and robustness\nof the detection models are still poor. The performance\nof the top-performing models in the ASVspoof and ADD\ncompetitions are very high but it will degrade significantly\nwhen evaluated on the mismatching dataset containing\nunseen fake attacks or unseen acoustic conditions or unseen\nlanguage. Some researchers have use effective loss function\nor continual learning methods to address this problem but\nthere is still much room for improvement.\nDealing with rapid development of deepfake tech-\nnologies: Deepfake technologies are developing rapidly and\nthe generated audio becoming increasingly realistic, it is\nhard to detect correctly. It brings new challenges to current\nexisting detection methods. In order to alleviate this issue,\ndeepfake audio generation and detection task are viewed\nas a rivalry game for participants in the ADD 2022 and\n2023 competitions. Participants in the generation task aim to\ngenerate deepfake samples to fool the detection model while\nparticipants in the detection task try to detect all fake ut-\nterances as much as possible. Despite partly improving the\nanti-attack ability of the detection model via fake game, the\nmethods of game are simple and lack intelligence. Therefore,\nwe should propose more effective detection approaches to\ncopy with the new unseen deepfake aduio technologies.\nImproving the interpretability of detection results:\nMost of existing researches foucs on distinguishing the fake\naudio from the bona fide one. However, there is also an\ninterest in surpassing the constraints of binary real/fake\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2023\n16\nclassification, and actually localizing the manipulated inter-\nvals in a partially fake speech as well as pinpointing the\nsource responsible for generating any fake audio. In addi-\ntion, interpretability of detection results is needed to provide\nin real applications, e.g. audio forensics and attribution. It\nis nontrivial to know why the utterance is fake and find\nthe tools or deepfake methods of generating the fake audio.\nIn addition, it is also important to know what manipula-\ntion technologies are employed and even intention of the\nmanipulation. It is particularly critical for audio forensics.\nDespite ADD 2023 challenge including manipulation region\nlocation and deepfake algorithm recognition sub-challenges,\nthe studies are still in infancy.\nExploring more reasonable evaluation metrics: EER\nis widely employed as the evaluation metric in previous\nwork, such as ASVspoof and ADD competitions. However,\nwe need to assess whether the EER is reasonable for the\naudio deepfake detection model or not in the future. We\nshould consider human detection capabilities, as well as\nthe differences between humans and machines for detecting\ndeepfake audio.\n9\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe deepfake technologies pose a serious threat to social\nsecurity and political economy if someone misuses them for\nmalicious purposes. Therefore, it is indispensable to detect\ndeepfake audio. To make audio deepfake detection useful in\npractice, we need to propose robust and general algorithms\nwith valid and reliable samples in order to make the detec-\ntion of deepfake audio applicable to real situations. Accord-\ningly, in this survey, we review the current research on audio\ndeepfake detection. We further compare the performance of\nexisting state-of-the-art methods, analyze the potential, and\nhighlight the outstanding issues for future research. Audio\ndeepfake detection has recently become an active research\narea; accordingly, we hope this survey can help researchers,\nas a starting point, to review the developments in the state-\nof-the-art and identify possible directions for their future\nresearch.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\nT.

    "2404.13914": "Audio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\nMENGLU LI, YASAMAN AHMADIADLI, and XIAO-PING ZHANG\u2217, Department of Electrical,\nComputer and Biomedical Engineering, Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada\nThe availability of smart devices leads to an exponential increase in multimedia content. However, the rapid\nadvancements in deep learning have given rise to sophisticated algorithms capable of manipulating or creating\nmultimedia fake content, known as Deepfake. Audio Deepfakes pose a significant threat by producing highly\nrealistic voices, thus facilitating the spread of misinformation. To address this issue, numerous audio anti-\nspoofing detection challenges have been organized to foster the development of anti-spoofing countermeasures.\nThis survey paper presents a comprehensive review of every component within the detection pipeline, including\nalgorithm architectures, optimization techniques, application generalizability, evaluation metrics, performance\ncomparisons, available datasets, and open-source availability. For each aspect, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation of the recent advancements, along with discussions on existing challenges. Additionally, we also\nexplore emerging research topics on audio anti-spoofing, including partial spoofing detection, cross-dataset\nevaluation, and adversarial attack defence, while proposing some promising research directions for future\nwork. This survey paper not only identifies the current state-of-the-art to establish strong baselines for future\nexperiments but also guides future researchers on a clear path for understanding and enhancing the audio\nanti-spoofing detection mechanisms.\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: Deepfakes, Speech synthesis, Audio anti-spoofing detection, Spoofing\ncountermeasures, ASV\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nDeep learning (DL) techniques have significantly advanced the creation of spoofing speech attacks,\ncommonly referred to as \"Deepfake\". Deepfake audio holds the potential to propagate misinfor-\nmation, for example defaming the credibility of prominent figures, leading to political insecurity,\nfake news, and manipulation of public opinion [37, 284]. Moreover, the rapid growth of Deepfake\naudio synthesis algorithms also puts voice-enabled devices at risk since the synthesized voices can\nmaliciously take over the control of a device.\nThe primary techniques of speech synthesis are Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion\n(VC). TTS models take the given text characters as input and utilize vocoders to generate a natural-\nsounding speech that follows the linguistic rules of the input text. The dominant TTS algorithms\nare typically structured as autoregressive-based models, such as WaveNet [214], Tacotron [232] or\nGAN-based architecture, like HiFi-GAN [107]. On the other hand, VC attacks alter original speech\nto mimic the voice of a specified target speaker while preserving linguistic information. Notably,\nthe source speech for VC models can originate from a TTS algorithm [255]. As audio spoofing\nthreats continue to emerge, the series of ASVspoof (Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and\nCountermeasures) [142] and ADD (Audio Deep Synthesis Detection) [266] challenges have been\ndeveloped and played a pivotal role in fostering the development of advanced algorithms to combat\naudio spoofing attacks. In this survey, we focus on reviewing and analyzing the recent advanced anti-\nspoofing countermeasures (CMs) targeting TTS and VC attacks across diverse application scenarios,\nextending beyond the scope of the Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems. Nonetheless, the\ndevelopment of CMs empowers ASV systems against potential threats.\n\u2217Corresponding Author\nAuthors\u2019 address: Menglu Li, menglu.li@torontomu.ca; Yasaman Ahmadiadli, yahmadiadli@torontomu.ca; Xiao-Ping Zhang,\nxpzhang@ieee.org, Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, Toronto Metropolitan University,\nToronto, ON, Canada, M5B 2K3.\narXiv:2404.13914v1  [cs.SD]  22 Apr 2024\n2\nLi et al.\nSeveral surveys on audio anti-spoofing detection have been published in recent years. The main\ndifferences between our survey and the existing ones are summarized as follows.\n- Broader definition of spoofed audio. We adopt a more inclusive definition of spoofed\naudio, to include both the entire fake audio clips generated by the TTS/VC algorithms and\nthe partial spoofed audio. We evaluate the detection models that specifically target partially\nfake portions within an audio clip, which has not been addressed in the previous surveys.\nWe also analyze speaker-aware audio anti-spoofing models, exploring the integration of\nspeaker verification and spoofing CMs to protect the ASV systems.\n- Optimization and performance enhancement techniques during the training pro-\ncess. While the existing surveys primarily concentrate on the architecture of detection\nalgorithms, including feature engineering and classifier structures, our survey extends the\nanalysis to include optimization and training techniques. We highlight the significance\nof factors like data augmentation and the choice of loss function, which can substantially\nimpact the detection performance. By examining these techniques collectively, we equip\nresearchers with a comprehensive toolkit for developing enhanced algorithms.\n- Explorations of emerging research topics. The publications in the field of audio Deepfake\nhave increased significantly in recent years, leading to the emergence of advanced topics\nlike adversarial attack defense and cross-dataset evaluation. Our survey provides a thorough\nreview and evaluation of newly published articles, ensuring up-to-date coverage of these\ntopics.\n- Emphasis on open-source availability. Open source plays a pivotal role as it fosters\ntechnological advancement. Our survey places significant emphasis on providing open-\nsource information for all reviewed models and datasets.\nMore specifically, several existing surveys [95, 103, 160, 283] provide literature reviews on\nDeepfake media content, with an emphasis on image and video aspects rather than audio. Besides,\nspecific surveys addressing audio anti-spoofing differ from this paper in several aspects. For example,\nMcuba et al. [161] mainly focus on reviewing the CNN-based classifiers. Almutairi et al. [6] and\nCuccovillo et al. [44] highlight the open challenge in the current solutions rather than providing\na detailed comparison of state-of-the-art (SOTA). Wang et al. [228], and Dixit et al. [55] provide\nan evaluation of the detection methods specifically targeting TTS/VC-generated fully spoofed\naudio clips. More recently, Khan et al. [102] and Yi et al. [267] briefly touch upon partially fake\nanti-spoofing detection in their surveys but do not offer a systematic discussion and evaluation\nof the specific algorithms involved. Furthermore, the existing work also lacks reviews on the\noptimization techniques that can be applied to the training process for performance enhancement.\nTherefore, we provide an in-depth review of various aspects of audio anti-spoofing technology,\nincluding the elements of detecting architecture, prevailing training techniques, methodologies\nembracing diverse application scenarios, and the latest available datasets. For each aspect, we will\ndiscuss the detailed design, evaluate the performance, address current limitations and explore future\ndirections. We aim to provide a thorough understanding of the broader picture for preventing\nmalicious audio Deepfakes, serving as a valuable reference guide for future researchers. Specifically,\nthe contribution of our survey can be summarized as follows:\n- We present a comprehensive review of each building block of developing audio anti-spoofing\ndetection algorithms and provide the evaluation of performance on both fully and partially\nspoofing scenarios.\n- We are the first to evaluate the effectiveness of optimization techniques applied in the model\ntraining process, such as data augmentation, activation functions and loss functions. We\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n3\nalso address the current stage of emerging research tasks, including transferring learning\nand the explainability of the detection architecture.\n- We provide open-source information regarding SOTA and benchmarking datasets, which\ngives a feasible guide to achieve reproductions.\n- We review the existing challenges faced by SOTA models and propose future research\ndirections for advancing audio anti-spoofing detection.\n2\nDATASETS AND EVALUATION METRICS FOR AUDIO ANTI-SPOOFING\nIn this section, we present a detailed summary of the datasets and evaluation metrics utilized to\naddress the challenge of audio spoofing.\n2.1\nDatasets\nWe provide the details and discuss the characteristics of the most recent widely utilized audio\ndatasets, categorized into three main types: fully spoofed, partially spoofed, and fully real datasets.\nThe fully spoofed datasets typically include both bona fide and spoofed speech generated by TTS\nand/or VC algorithms. Partially spoofed datasets involve replacing partial segments of the original\nreal utterances with synthesized or manipulated audio. Fully real datasets are crucial for training\naudio spoofing algorithms or they serve as bona fide samples in the first two categories of datasets.\nComprehensive information regarding fully spoofed and partially spoofed datasets is presented in\nTable 1.\n2.1.1\nFully spoofed audio datasets.\nASVspoof2019-LA[255] This dataset is divided into two subsets, logical access (LA) and physical\naccess (PA), with PA featuring the replay-spoof speech and LA containing TTS and VC-generated\nspoofed speech, all derived from the VCTK database [256]. This survey mainly focuses on the LA\nsubset. The evaluation set in this dataset contains spoofed speech created by 13 unseen algorithms\nin the training or development set, to evaluate the generalizability of anti-spoofing detection\nalgorithms. It\u2019s important to note that all data in the dataset is clean, without noise, or channel\nvariation, which may lead to a detachment from real-world conditions.\nASVspoof2021-LA[142] This dataset is an extension version of the ASVspoof2019-LA, aiming\nto bridge the gap between ideal experimental and real-world conditions. The evaluation data are\nacross the real telephone systems, incorporating various codecs, transmission channels, bitrates and\nsample rates. Typically, anti-spoofing algorithms are trained using the training and development\nset of ASVspoof2019-LA, and then evaluated using ASVspoof2021-LA to test their generalizability\ntowards unknown channel variations. There is no additive noise in this dataset.\nASVspoof2021-DF[142] The Deepfake Speech (DF) subset is newly introduced in ASVspoof2021,\ndistinct from ASV systems. Both bona fide and spoofed speech utterances in the DF track are pro-\ncessed with different lossy codecs, potentially introducing distortion. This DF subset contains the\naudio clips from the ASVspoof2019-LA evaluation set, along with data from Voice Conversion\nChallenge (VCC) 2018 [143] and 2020 [268] databases. As a result, the DF evaluation set is gener-\nated by more than hundreds of different TTS and VC spoofing attack algorithms under various\ncompression conditions as well as different source domains.\nFakeorReal-orginal (FoR)[183] FoR-orginal is an English audio dataset that contains both\nbona fide and spoofed speech generated by diverse TTS algorithms. The FoR dataset provides three\npublicly available versions, each with different pre-processing methods.\nWaveFake[63] WaveFake is a spoofed audio dataset, generated by six different GAN-based TTS\nalgorithms across two languages, English and Japanese. There is no additive noise in this dataset\nand it only contains two speakers.\n4\nLi et al.\nTable 1.

Both bona fide and spoofed audio samples\nare collected from publicly available sources such as social networks and video streaming platforms,\npotentially containing background noises. This dataset is intended to evaluate the generalizability\nof detection models, including cross-dataset evaluation.\nTIMIT-TTS[190] TIMIT-TTS is a synthetic speech dataset containing 12 SOTA TTS algorithms.\nAll selected TTS algorithms are spectrogram generators, which keep the differences between\nthe generated speech primarily attributable to the vocoders. Various post-processing techniques,\nincluding adding Gaussian noises, applying MP3 codecs and adding reverberation compression, are\napplied to reduce the audio quality and hide some artifacts.\nFMFCC-A[294] FMFCC-A is a publicly available Mandarin audio spoofed dataset generated\nby both TTS and VC algorithms. The entire dataset is partitioned into the training, development\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n5\nand evaluation sets, with the evaluation set featuring speech synthesis algorithms unseen by the\ntraining set. Also, half of the evaluation dataset is randomly selected to process a compression-\ndecompression operation or add Gaussian noise to enhance its diversity.\nChinese Fake Audio Detection (CFAD)[150] CFAD is another publicly available Mandarin\naudio spoofed dataset consisting of twelve different spoofing algorithms including both TTS and\nVC types. This dataset offers two notable advantages over the FMFCC-A dataset. Firstly, bona fide\ndata in CFAD is sourced from six different domains to prevent bias, whereas FMFCC-A collects\nfrom a single source. Secondly, CFAD provides detailed labelling, including information on the\nspoofed type, real data source, noise type, signal-to-noise ratio, and media codec types.\nADD2022-LF [265] The low-quality (LF) track of the ADD2022 challenge focuses on utterances\nwith various real-world noises and background music effects. This dataset is inaccessible online.\nLatin-American Voice Anti-spoofing [210] The dataset utilizes TTS and VC algorithms to\ngenerate spoofed speeches with five different accents of Latin-American Spanish.\nMulti-Language Audio Anti-spoofing (MLAAD)[166] MLAAD is a newly published spoofed\naudio dataset created using 54 TTS models across 23 languages. Its novelty is reflected in its\nvariety of languages. This dataset can be utilized either as new out-of-domain test data for existing\nanti-spoofing models or as an additional training resource.\n2.1.2\nPartially spoofed audio datasets.\nPartial Synthetic Detection (Psynd)[275] The data samples in this dataset are real utterances\ninjected with synthetic speech segments closely resembling the target speakers, generated by\nmulti-speaker TTS algorithms. In training, validation, and preliminary test data, each utterance\nincorporates one single fake segment. Special cases, such as fully faked, fully real, and multi-fake\nsegments, are stored in the special test set.\nPartialSpoof[278] The PartialSpoof dataset contains spoofed speech with varying proportions\nof spoofed audio segments within a single utterance. This is achieved by pairing speech utterances,\nwith one entirely generated using TTS or VC, and another being an original bona fide speech\nutterance. Short segments within the pairs are randomly substituted with different lengths. Notably,\nthis dataset offers fine-grain labels, including segmental-level labels at different temporal resolutions.\nADD2022-PF[265] The Partially Fake audio detection (PF) track in the ADD2022 challenge\ndataset contains fake utterances generated by replacing the partial segments of the original genuine\nutterances with real as well as synthesized audio. The details of generation algorithms for the\nspoofed segments are not provided.\nADD2023-PF[266] The PF track is extended in the ADD2023 challenge, which focuses on\nlocating the manipulated regions in partially fake audio in addition to spoofing detection. Additive\nnoise and format conversions are also applied to the utterances.\nHalf-Truth (HAD)[264] The HAD dataset features partially fake speech where a few words\nin an utterance are altered using TTS generation techniques. This dataset is designed to evaluate\nanti-spoofing methods and localize partially fake audio. The replaced keywords include entities,\nsuch as person, location, organization, and time.\n2.1.3\nFully real audio datasets.\nVoice cloning toolkit (VCTK)[256] This dataset includes speech data uttered by 110 English\nspeakers with different accents. All speech data is recorded using the same recording setup with 16\nbit/s and 48kHz.\nLibriSpeech[175] This dataset is a corpus of approximately 1000 hours of reading English speech\nwith a sampling rate of 16 kHz.\n6\nLi et al.\nVoxCeleb2[41] This dataset is a multi-language dataset that contains over one million human\nvoices for 6,112 celebrities, extracted from videos uploaded to YouTube. The speech data are captured\nwith real-world noise including laughter, cross-talk, channel effects, music, and more.\nLJ Speech[90] This dataset consists of 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading\npassages from 7 non-fiction English books.\nAISHELL-3[192] This dataset is a high-fidelity multi-speaker Mandarin speech corpus. The\ncorpus contains roughly 85 hours of emotion-neutral recordings spoken by 218 native Chinese\nMandarin speakers and a total of 88035 utterances.\n2.2\nEvaluation metrics\nWe examine the evaluation metrics utilized in the audio anti-spoofing literature, discussing their\nstrengths and limitations. Furthermore, we emphasize metrics tailored to address the specific\nchallenges of detecting partially spoofed content.\nEqual Error Rate (EER) The EER is one of most widely used evaluation metrics for audio spoof-\ning CMs. It represents the CM threshold where the false acceptance rate equals the false rejection\nrate. A lower EER value signifies better performance. This metric offers a more comprehensive and\nobjective assessment compared to accuracy, particularly in scenarios with unbalanced evaluation\ndatasets. Notably, EER serves as the evaluation metric in the ASVspoof and ADD challenge series.\nF1-score The F1-score is another metric commonly used in binary classification problems to\nhandle unbalanced evaluation datasets. It represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall,\neffectively considering both the false acceptance rate and the false rejection rate.\nAccuracy Accuracy is the most intuitive metric to reflect the detection performance. However,\nit can be biased by unbalanced conditions within the evaluation dataset.\nTandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF) [106] The t-DCF metric is developed during the\nASVspoof2019 challenge as an ASV-centric evaluation method. It shifts the focus from the spoofing\nCMs alone to offer a more comprehensive assessment for ASV attack detection. Recognizing that\nspoofing CMs and ASV systems operate under different hypotheses and objectives, the t-DCF\nconsiders both systems combined in cascaded order. It reflects the cost of detection decisions made\nby the combination of ASV and CM in a Bayesian sense.\nRange-based EER [279] This metric is specifically proposed to evaluate segment-level spoofing\ndetection for the partially spoofed task. Unlike traditional EER measurements that compare discrete\npredicted segment scores and their corresponding segment-level labels, which may be influenced\nby the resolution of utterances, a range-based EER can be utilized. This approach measures the\nduration of misclassified regions between references and hypotheses of each trial with a finer\nresolution.\n3\nFULLY SPOOFED DETECTION\nIn this section, we comprehensively evaluate every component within the detection pipeline for fully\nspoofed audio, including algorithm architectures and training optimization techniques. Audio anti-\nspoofing detection models are typically structured by two modules: front-end feature extraction\nand back-end classifier. However, End-to-end (E2E) architectures have gained more attention\ndue to their capability to avoid information loss caused by pre-defined feature extraction. We\nevaluate recent advancements in feature engineering, classifier development, and E2E architectures.\nFurthermore, we assess various training optimization techniques mentioned in the literature,\nincluding data augmentation, loss functions, and activation functions. Our focus lies on elucidating\nthe effectiveness of each optimization technique to enhance the performance of spoofing CMs.\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n7\nTable 2.

The bold values\nrefer to the best performance on the same dataset. \"+\u201d indicates multiple techniques processed in parallel, while \"\u2192\" denotes sequential order.\n3.1\nFeature Engineering\nWe categorize the current methodologies of feature extraction into three groups: hand-crafted\ntraditional spectral features, deep-learning features, and other analysis-oriented approaches, as\nsummarized in TABLE 3.\n3.1.1\nHand-crafted spectral features. Hand-crafted features have been demonstrated as a strong\nbaseline for audio anti-spoofing detection, providing a reliable foundation for capturing discrimina-\ntive patterns of artifacts.\n8\nLi et al.\nMagnitude-based spectral coefficient The literature shows that the majority of front-end\nfeatures are derived from the magnitude/power spectrum, where the power spectrum is the square\nof the magnitude spectrum. Short-term magnitude spectral features are commonly obtained from\ndiscrete Fourier transforms (DFT), such as Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) [50], inverted\nMel frequency cepstral coefficient (IMFCC) [28], linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) [4],\nand rectangular filter cepstral coefficients (RFCCs) [85], and linear prediction cepstral coefficients\n(LPCC) [66]. Sahidullah et al. [188] are the first to compare nine short-term magnitude-based\nspectral features alongside their first- and second-order derivatives, highlighting the benefits of\nincorporating dynamic features in capturing temporal changes. Recent advancements have focused\non enhancing conventional coefficients by refining windowing techniques and filter configurations\nduring the extraction process. Mewada et al. [163] propose to utilize a Gaussian filter to obtain\nthe IMFCC because of their ability to capture more global information compared to linear or\ntriangular filter banks. Liu et al. [137] extract and stack short-time Fourier transform(STFT) feature\nmaps with varying time-frequency resolutions by using different window lengths and frame shifts.\nAdditionally, [137] notes that the longer window length performs more effectively than the shorter\none. Gammatone cepstral coefficient (GTCC) [26] utilizes an Equal Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB)\nfrequency scale, which is more robust to the noise compared to the traditional Mel-scale. Gasenzer\net al. [69] propose the wavelet packet transform (WPT) as an alternative to the DFT since the WPT\nprovides a high resolution in the high-frequency part. The experiments suggest that the WPT\noutperforms STFT in the situation of low sampling rates or compression.\nIn contrast to short-term spectral features derived from fixed short window lengths, long-term\nwindow transforms have been proposed to capture long-range information and achieve higher\nfrequency resolution. Constant-Q cepstral coefficient (CQCC) [207] has shown its effectiveness in\naudio anti-spoofing detection by providing higher frequency resolutions at lower frequencies and\nhigher temporal resolution at higher frequencies. Variants of CQCC are continuously proposed. Li\net al. [127] modify the CQCC by incorporating a block transform, segmenting the CQT log power\nspectrum into overlap blocks and performing the discrete cosine transform (DCT) individually on\neach block. It leads to a 36% improvement over conventional CQCC on the ASVspoof2015 dataset.\nYang et al. [259] propose to keep the information from the octave power spectrum in addition\nto CQCC from the linear power spectrum. The CQT-based power spectrum is inverted in [258]\nto emphasize the high-frequency information. Kwak et al. [110] explore the impact of frequency\nvariations by experimenting with different values for minimum central frequency and total numbers\nof frequency bins while fixing the number of bins per octave and hop size. By setting the minimum\ncentral frequency to 1Hz and the total number of frequency bins to 100, it receives an EER of 2.19%\non the ASVspoof2019-LA set. In addition to CQT, Li et al. [119] introduce a long-term variable\nQ transform (L-VQT), where the frequencies vary as a power function rather than exponential\nas in CQT, aiming to capture better high-frequency information and detect artifacts created by\ncommonly-used vocoders like WaveNet, even in noisy conditions. Apart from CQT-based features,\nGao et al. [67] utilize global 2D-DCT on Mel-scale magnitude spectrum across both temporal and\nfrequency dimensions to capture long-term modulation artifacts created by frame-level audio\ngeneration algorithms.\nPhase-based spectral coefficient The spoofed speech often lacks natural phase information, as\nthe human auditory system tends to be less sensitive to phase spectrum characteristics compared\nto magnitude spectrum features. Therefore, investigating the phase information can be effective\nin capturing these artifacts in spoofed speech. In addition to short-term phase-based features,\nsuch as modified group delay cepstral coefficients (MGDCC) [245], Wang et al. [221] propose a\nrelative phase extraction method aimed to reduce the phase variation, where the peaks of the\nutterance waveform serve as the center of each window section. Furthermore, Gupta et al.

Therefore, phase information always\nserves as a complement to magnitude information in anti-spoofing detection. Yang et al. [261]\npropose a modified magnitude-phase spectrum (MMPS) to collectively capture both magnitude\nand phase information while preserving the sign of the magnitude part. Kim et al. [105] apply a\nconvolution layer with batch normalization (BN) and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation to the\nphase feature to mitigate the high randomness of the phase spectrum before concatenating it with\nthe magnitude feature. Patil et al, [177] integrate phase information by estimating the Instantaneous\nFrequency (IF) with magnitude information represented by cochlear filter cepstral coefficients\n(CFCC). They observe that the dynamic variations in the IFs of real speech are substantially larger\nthan those of spoofed speech.\nBispectrum The magnitude/power spectrum lacks sensitivity to higher-order spectral correla-\ntions, which is revealed by bispectral analysis. AlBadawy et al. [3] conduct a qualitative assessment\n10\nLi et al.\nto reveal the difference in both magnitude and phase of bispectrum between real and synthesized\nspeech. Leveraging statistics of the first four moments of bispectral correlations as an eight-\ndimensional hand-crafted feature achieved high accuracy detection performance with a basic linear\nclassifier, particularly under a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) condition. The bispectral features\nfrom [3] are combined with power spectrum features, such as STFT and MFCC, which improves\nthe detection performance for the known attacks [21, 196]\nImage-like features In audio anti-spoofing detection, magnitude-based spectral coefficients\nare typically integrated with the magnitude of the audio signal over time to form a spectrogram, a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) feature. The spectrogram includes information regarding frequencies and\nintensities of the audio signal as it propagates in time. Front-end features, such as Mel-spectrogram\n(Mel-Spec), and CQT-spectrogram (CQT-Spec) are always treated as images and passed to CNN-\nbased back-end classifiers [7, 16, 30, 76, 182]. The spectrogram requires less computation power\nthan extracting the spectral coefficients through DCT while promising detection accuracy [1]. Xiang\net al. [246] propose an Efficient Spectrogram (E-Spec), which applies STFT directly to the decoded\naudio signal along the frequency axis after the compression filterbank. E-Spec approximates the\nspectrogram of the MP3 speech without decompressing the signal, and it outperforms the original\nSpectrogram by 11% on the compressed ASVSpoof2019-LA evaluation set. Phase information is\nalso integrated with the magnitude spectrogram [93, 179]. Muller et al. [170] introduce a complex-\nvalued CQT (C-CQT) log-spectrogram to embed phase information, which requests modifications to\nclassifier networks, activation functions, and Batch Normalization (BN) to handle complex-valued\ninput and weights. Furthermore, some research applies texture analysis tools to spectrogram-based\nfeatures, including local binary pattern (LBP) [51, 77], and Modified local ternary patterns (MLTP)\n[89], along with edge detection tools like Canny [162]. Khan et al. [101] propose a method to\nslice the log-mel spectrogram into square segments. For each segment, the local deviated pattern\n(LDP) operation is applied to identify the local higher and lower frequency spectrum, forming local\nspectral deviation coefficients (SDC) for detecting the frame-level inconsistencies.\n3.1.2\nDeep-learning (DL) features. With the advancement of deep learning approaches, DL-based\nstructures have been adopted to extract learnable embeddings to describe the underlying char-\nacteristics of raw audio, alongside traditional hand-crafted features. Various types of the recent\nDL-based features are discussed below.\nFilter-learning feature DL techniques are involved in approximating the standard filtering\nprocess for both STFT-based and First-order Scattering Transform (FST)-based front-ends. Learnable\nSTFT-based features like nnAudio [36], and DNN-FBCC [270] are implemented without constraining\nthe shape of the filter, leading to a larger number of parameters in training and potential overfitting.\nFu et al. [65] enhance nnAudio by restricting the filter shape to triangular and making only the\nfilterbanks learnable, resulting in improved performance. On the other hand, learnable FST-based\nfront-ends, such as SincNet [273], utilize a convolutional layer to parameterize the sinc function,\neffectively acting as a customized filter bank. However, it also may suffer from overfitting by\nlearning the low and high cut-off frequencies during training. In the work of RawNet2 [208],\nSincNet is utilized to extract the front-end feature directly from the raw audio while fixing the\ncut-off frequencies to reduce overfitting. The success of RawNet2 makes it one of the most well-\nknown and reproducible models in audio anti-spoofing detection, serving as an official baseline in\nthe ASVspoof challenge series. Furthermore, [204] adds one additional channel dimension to the\noutput of the SincNet front-end to form a time-frequency representation.\nSupervised embedding In this category, DL models, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN),\nResidual Networks (ResNet), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are applied directly on the\nraw audio data or after the hand-crafted feature to construct deep embeddings through supervised\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n11\ntraining [15, 48, 101, 193]. Teng et al. [212] choose to use the whole structure of RawNet2 as an\nencoder for raw waveforms, combined with ECAPA-TDNN [34] as the encoder for the CQT feature.\nTwo embeddings from both encoders are concatenated and encoded by a convolutional layer\nwith BN. Wu et al. [244] construct a stack of convolutional layers and convolutional transpose\nlayers acting as a genuinization transformer, which is similar to an autoencoder to learn the\ncharacteristics of bonafide speech and amplify differences between fake and real speech. Most\nrecently, [30] employs a U-net network with attention mechanisms and skip connections, termed\nTwice Attention U-net (TA-Unet) [186], to process CQT-spectrograms, aiming to prevent overfitting\nwhile emphasizing artifact locations on the spectrogram feature. Wang et al. [224] explore ResNet-\nbased DL structures to capture raw layer-wise neuron behaviours. The activated neurons that\nhave better capability to identify the difference between real and fake are passed to the back-end\nclassifier. Performing detection by observing the neuron behaviours is found to be robust to the\nreal-world noise. Alam et al. [2] intergrate higher order statistics (HOS) into the output embedding\nof the Time delay neural network (TDNN), incorporating statistical information such as skewness\nand kurtosis to enhance detection performance, beyond mean and standard deviation derived from\nthe statistics pooling layer in TDNN.\nPre-trained embedding Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have demonstrated their ca-\npability to generate latent representations of raw audio waveforms. These SSL-based features\noutperform the hand-crafted acoustic features or other learnable features in various tasks, including\nspeech and emotion recognition. In audio anti-spoofing tasks, research works show that replacing\nhand-crafted features or SincNet front-ends with pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 features significantly\nboosts detection performance when employing the same back-end classifier and data augmen-\ntation techniques [115, 148, 209]. Furthermore, fine-tuning SSL features along with the classifier\nduring training accelerates convergence and enhances detection performance for both known\nand unknown attacks [227]. The commonly-used pre-trained SSL models in audio anti-spoofing\ndetection are wav2vec 2.0 [59, 227], WavLM [235, 298], HuBERT [123], and Whisper encoder [99].\nSpecifically, experiments highlight that pre-trained models trained on diverse speech data sources,\nsuch as wav2vec 2.0-Large2 [14] and wav2vec2.0-XLSR [12], achieve better results on out-of-domain\nsamples [227]. Integration of attention mechanisms into SSL-based models further enhances their\neffectiveness. [158] applies a temporal normalization on the hidden state of each transformer layer\nin the wav2vec 2.0 model, where each normalized representation is multiplied with a trainable\nweight during fine-tuning. Zhu et al. [298] assign different weights to each channel of the deep\nembedding to maximize the effectiveness of specific channels for discriminating spoofed detection.\nIn addition to SSL-based features, certain other deep-learning architectures pre-trained using\nexternal datasets have been reported in the literature as front-end representation extractors, in-\ncluding TDNN [154], HiFi-GAN [56], and ImageNet [144]. However, these pre-trained models are\nnot as effective as SSL models, like wav2vec 2.0, especially for more robust datasets with varied\ncodec conditions.\n3.1.3\nOther analysis-oriented features. The majority of efforts on feature engineering for audio\nanti-spoofing detection concentrate on extracting hand-crafted spectral representations or high-\nlevel embeddings using DL techniques. At the same time, various other specific directions for\nfeature development have been explored to improve the robustness of anti-spoofing systems, such\nas analyzing the impact of silence and sub-band frequencies.\nProsody and semantic features Blue et al. [20] suggest that audio Deepfake models may\nproduce significant inconsistencies compared to a regular human vocal tract, such as unnatural vocal\ntract diameters. Therefore, they develop a mathematical model to estimate the cross-sectional area\nof the vocal tract at various points along the speaker\u2019s airway and design an anti-spoofing detector\n12\nLi et al.\ncapable of detecting TTS speech. Dhamyal et al. [53] investigates microfeatures, including Voicing\nOnset Time (VOT) and coarticulation, which are associated with voice production mechanisms\nin humans. The continuous shimmer is proven to reflect the stability of amplitude and frequency\nperturbation in the voice and is utilized as a feature to distinguish spoofed audios [120, 121].\nDL-based prosody and semantic features have also been proposed. Wang et al. [218] incorporate\ntwo types of prosodic features with wav2vec 2.0 embeddings: phoneme duration feature and\npronunciation features. They are extracted using a pre-trained HuBERT and a Conformer model\n[81] respectively. Attorresi et al. [10] trains the same structure of the prosody encoder [197] used\nby Tacotron to enhance prosody in TTS-synthesized speech as the prosodic embedding extractor in\nthe detection process. Conti et al. [43] is the first to use a pre-trained Speech Emotion Recognition\n(SER) system to extract emotion embeddings based on the semantics for anti-spoofing detection.\nLike other mentioned prosody and semantic features, this emotion embedding is effective for\nTTS-generated fake speeches only, rather than VC-based spoofed speech.\nThe impact of silence Some researchers argue that the silence portion works as a significant\nfeature for the current anti-spoofing detectors [157, 169, 172]. Specifically, the duration proportion\nof silence plays a significant role in detecting TTS spoofing, while the content of silence is an\nimportant factor in detecting VC attacks [288]. It is because TTS algorithms lack the ability to model\ndiverse and accurate pauses, whereas silence portions in VC spoof audios have signal discontinuity\ncompared to bonafide speech. Utilizing voice activity detection (VAD) to detect and remove silent\nportions leads to performance degradation. To utilize the effectiveness of the silent part, Doan\net al. [57] encode the correlation between breathing, talking and silence sounds in audio clips as\nthe front-end feature. It is important to note that all existing research on the impact of silence is\nconducted using clean data. These findings may not necessarily hold in noisy conditions or when\nusing various codecs.\nFrequency sub-band feature Instead of utilizing feature maps covering the entire frequency\nrange, studies have investigated sub-band spectral information to identify specific ranges containing\nmore discriminative information relevant to detecting spoofing speech [199, 201]. Research shows\nthat sub-band features, particularly within the low-frequency band of 0-4kHz, outperform the\nfull-band features against channel effects, codecs and noisy conditions, while the high-frequency\npart of spectrograms may lead to overfitting [126, 233, 260]. This finding holds significance for the\ndevelopment of resource-constrained anti-spoofing detectors. [60] and [250] further narrow down\nthe low-frequency band to 0-400Hz, focusing on the fundamental (F0) frequency. By only including\nthe F0 sub-band of the log-power spectrogram as the feature, it can still achieve a satisfactory\ndetection result on the ASVspoof2019-LA set with an EER of 1.15%. [168] point out that, in voiced\nsegments, most spectral differences lie within the 0-4kHz frequency band. Conversely, for silence\nand unvoiced segments, the spectral discriminating features predominantly reside in the 4-8kHz\nrange. This observation may explain performance degradation after silencing removal, particularly\nwhen the feature emphasizes high frequencies.\nVaried input length To pass inputs into DL architectures in batch, audio inputs are often set\nto be fixed-size through trimming or padding. However, this approach may lead to information\nloss or the propagation of irrelevant information [35]. Wang et al. [226] propose to add a pooling\nlayer before DL models to handle varied input lengths, which outperforms fixed-length inputs with\nthe same back-end classifiers. Consequently, more research has started to accept variable-length\nspeech as an input [117, 139, 165].\nOther possible directions Other research endeavours have aimed to develop alternative types of\nfeatures contributing to anti-spoofing detection. Deng et al. [52] investigate the energy loss in pauses\nbetween words and the high-frequency range caused by spoofing algorithms. Yadav et al. [254]\nexplore the utilization of compression coding metadata information solely from the compressed\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n13\nbit-stream as a feature, which overcomes detection problems for compressed speech, such as\nAdvanced Audio Coding (AAC) compressed audio. Xue et al. [252] construct face embeddings from\nspectrograms to describe speaker information such as gender, and mouth shape, and concatenate\nface features and audio features as the front-end. Liu et al. [135] convert mono audio signals to\ndual channels, encoding and processing each channel signal separately to capture different detail\ncues for anti-spoofing detection.\n3.1.4\nPerformance discussion on feature selection. The current trend in feature engineering for\naudio anti-spoofing is shifting from hand-crafted features towards deep embedding representations,\nparticularly derived from pre-trained SSL-based models. This transition is motivated by that\nconventional acoustic features, based on mathematical principles, may not fully capture hidden\ninformation from unknown attacks as effectively as learnable features. Learnable features excel in\nextracting high-level representations from raw audio data, leading to improved performance in\ncross-dataset testing scenarios. Nevertheless, despite their limitations, hand-crafted features should\nnot be discarded. Hand-crafted features demand fewer computational resources while offering a\nhigh degree of interpretability. In contrast, learnable features usually require a longer training\ntime with a larger amount of model parameters. In cases of limited training data quantity or\nquality, hand-crafted features and SSL-based features employing transfer learning often outperform\nlearnable features. Therefore, a promising direction involves integrating both hand-crafted and\nlearnable features to construct a robust system. Additionally, while utilizing prosodic-based and\nphase-based features alone may not yield competitive detection outcomes, they offer value as\ncomplementary features alongside others, such as magnitude-based spectral features and learnable\nfeatures.\nIn the literature, various techniques are employed to enhance performance, such as pre-emphasis.\nPre-emphasis involves applying a first-order high-pass filter directly to the speech signal to amplify\nits high-frequency content, thereby boosting the energy of the sound [26, 88, 100, 101]. This\npractice is commonly applied directly to speech signals before feature extration to address issues\nrelated to high-frequency noise induced by transmission. Normalization on spectrograms is another\nwidely used operation in the literature, which reflects mainly the tonal characteristics of speakers\n[30, 76, 100].\n3.2\nClassifier Architecture\nIn addition to traditional machine learning classifiers, SOTA anti-spoofing algorithms focus on\nutilizing DL architectures such as CNN and ResNet as classifiers. We assess the strengths and\nlimitations of different classifier structures, as summarized in TABLE 4. Certain models incorporate\nmultiple DL architectures. For instance, RawNet2 [208] integrates a gated recurrent unit (GRU)\nlayer after ResNet blocks. Here, we categorize these models based on their primary structure.\n3.2.1\nTraditional Machine Learning (ML) classifiers. Classic ML-based classifiers are commonly\nused in the early years of audio anti-spoofing detection, including support vector machines (SVM),\nGaussian mixture models (GMM), and random forest (RF) [29, 91, 269]. In particular, GMM-based\nclassifiers serve as a fundamental baseline method in the ASVSpoof challenge series.\n3.2.2\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN architecture is well-known for its effectivenss\nin capturing local and hierarchical features. Lavrentyava et al. [113] apply the CNN architecture\nto address the anti-spoofing problem while reducing model size by implementing a Light-CNN\n(LCNN). LCNN mainly replaces ReLU with Max-Feature-Map (MFM) activation, which selects\nthe maximum value of each of the two feature channels as output, effectively halving the LCNN\narchitecture. The MFM layer also performs feature selection. The effectiveness of LCNN is also\n14\nLi et al.\nTable 4.

However, the translation invariance property in\nCNN may lead to information loss in the frequency domain, particularly because different sub-band\nfrequencies contain diverse information. Choi et al. [39] suggest splitting spectrogram inputs along\nthe frequency axis and processing the high-, mid- and low-frequency band by the LCNN separately.\nRanjan et al. [181] consider both frequency and temporal information separately by performing\nCNN modules on these two domains in parallel. Luo et al. [147] modify the dynamic routing\nstrategies in the capsule network to be suitable for audio anti-spoofing detection, emphasizing\nhierarchical structures of features and spatial information of the artifacts. This approach achieves\nsatisfactory outputs without data augmentation.\n3.2.3\nResidual Network (ResNet). ResNet is one of the significant variants of CNN architecture,\naddressing the vanishing gradient problem in a deep network by incorporating skip connections.\nResNets are also widely used in audio anti-spoofing tasks and achieve promising outcomes [7, 208].\nRecent works have focused on modifying and enhancing the fundamental structure of ResNet. Lai\net al. [112] integrate squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks with ResNet, forming SE-Nets, to perform\ndynamic channel-wise feature recalibration. [110] and [115] adapt the MFM activation layer to\neach ResNet block. termed ResMax. Instead of sequentially connecting all residual-connected\nconvolution blocks, Li et al. [116] propose Deep layer aggregation (DLA) to group them into a\ntree-like structure, to enhance information fusion across multiple resolutions and integrate local and\nglobal information. ResNeXt modifies the ResNet by stacking more subpaths in parallel within each\nblock to learn more diverse features [296]. To improve the information flow in ResNet, DenseNet\n[40, 45, 234] is proposed to skip connections linking each layer to all layers within the same dense\nblock. DenseNets also have fewer parameters compared to the conventional ResNets.\nIn addition to the previously discussed techniques, Res2Net stands out as another significant vari-\nant of the ResNet architecture [128, 129, 220]. Res2Net modifies the bottleneck block to incorporate a\nhierarchical residual-like connection. Instead of passing the entire feature map to the convolutional\nlayer as a whole, Res2Net divides the input feature map along the channel dimension into several\nfeature segments of equal size. Before conducting the convolutional operation on each subsegment,\nthe convolutional result from the previous subsegment is added, creating a multi-scale feature\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n15\nrepresentation. Furthermore, adjustments are made to the addition operation of feature segments in\nthe basic Res2Net structure. For instance, a dynamic modulated (DM) mechanism assigns different\nweights to both the current and previous feature segments before addition [262]. Dong et al. [58]\nimplement additional convolutional operations with various kernel sizes on the feature segments\nafter addition to gain multi-perspective information (MPIF) from different receptive fields.\n3.2.4\nGraph Neural Network (GNN). To apply GNN in audio anti-spoofing, the frequency bins\nand time frames can be utilized as nodes to form a fully connected graph. One common variant of\nGNN is the graph convolutional network (GCN). Chen et al. [32] divide the spectrogram into grid\npatches and extracts each patch embedding using a CNN, emphasizing the network\u2019s focus on the\nrelationship between patches. Position embeddings are also added to retain positional information.\nSubsequently, each patch embedding passes through several layers of GCN to aggregate node\nfeatures within the same time frames or frequency bands.\nGraph attention network (GAT) introduces the attention mechanism during node feature aggrega-\ntion. Tak et al. [205] conduct experiments utilizing several GATs with the conventional handcrafted\nfeature, log-linear filterbank feature (LFB). Then, [204] replace the LFB features with the learnable\nSincNet front-end, named RawGAT. The GAT-based classifier consists of three components. Initially,\nthe first two GATs individually model the relationships within spectral and temporal domains. Then,\nthese two sub-graphs are fused to facilitate the processing of the third GAT, thereby leveraging\ncomplementary information. AASIST [32] is introduced as an enhancement to RawGAT by incorpo-\nrating a heterogeneity-aware technique to integrate spectral and temporal sub-graphs. In AASIST,\neach node aggregates information from all other spectral nodes and temporal nodes in the graph,\nwhereas nodes in RawGAT only aggregate information within the spectral and temporal sub-graphs\nindividually. Huang et al. [88] make two adjustments to RawGAT by adding a pre-emphasis module\nbefore the SincNet filter to enhance the high-frequency components and replacing BatchNorm\nwith LayerNorm to reduce the impact caused by uneven samples. These two adjustments lead to a\n51% improvement in the ASVspoof2019-LA set.\n3.2.5\nTransformer. In the context of audio anti-spoofing, Transformer encoders are often inte-\ngrated with other DL architectures, such as ResNet [295] or CNN [18, 125]. The compact convolu-\ntional Transformer (CCT) [17] is proposed by incorporating two 2D convolutional layers before\nTransformer encoders to enhance generalization ability. This strategy aims to extract high-level\nembeddings from the input spectrogram feature, rather than directly dividing the spectrogram\ninto patches and feeding them to the Transformer. These high embeddings obtained after the\nconvolutional layers aggregate information from all regions of the spectrogram. [117] modifies the\n2D convolutional layer into 1D, accompanied by a smaller number of Transformer encoders, named\nOCT, to reduce overfitting. Rawformer, proposed by [139] combines SE-Res2Net with a positional\naggregator before passing to Transformer encoders. This integration of Res2Net and Transformer\narchitectures aims to effectively capture both local and global dependencies.\nThe conventional Transformer architecture typically focuses on the temporal domain exclusively\n[253]. However, recent advancements have been made to adapt the Transformer to treat the\ntemporal and frequency dimensions equally. Zhang et al. [276] leverage both the feature matrix and\nits transposed version to facilitate self-attention mechanism across both temporal and frequency\ndomains. [235] proposes a Temporal-Frequency Transformer (TFT) module, consisting of the\ntemporal modeling branch and the frequency modeling branch in parallel. This design effectively\ncaptures long-term dependencies in both domains simultaneously.\n3.2.6\nTime-Delay Neural Network (TDNN). TDNN is widely recognized in tasks like speech recog-\nnition by converting acoustic signals into phonetic representations. Various efforts have been made\n16\nLi et al.\nto utilize TDNN variants, such as ECAPA-TDNN, for spoofed audio detection [29, 34, 46, 243]. How-\never, the performance of TDNN in antispoofing countermeasures remains suboptimal compared to\ntheir effectiveness in speaker verification.\n3.2.7\nDifferentiable Architecture Search (DART). DART [133] introduces a dynamic detection model,\nenabling optimization of both architectures and parameter values based on performance on the\nvalidation set using gradient descent. The candidate operations for network building blocks include\nconvolutional, pooling, and residual layers. To reduce computation power and memory usage, Ge\net al. [70] propose a partially-connected DARTS (PC-DARTS) by adding a random mask to some\npartial channels during the architecture search stage. With random masking, PC-DARTS ensures\ncomplex architecture learning while reducing training time by 50% compared to standard DARTS.\nBuilding upon PC-DARTS, Raw PC-DARTS [71] further advances the methodology by leveraging a\nlearnable SincNet filter with filter masking to handle raw input signals directly, rather than using\nLFCC features as the front-end. This approach leads to a 64% performance improvement in EER. In\n[217], Light-DARTS is introduced, incorporating the MFM module as one of the potential candidate\noperations within the architecture search space, where the MFM module functions as a feature\nselection mechanism.\n3.2.8\nPooling and Attention mechanism. Pooling layers and attention mechanisms serve critical\nfunctions in back-end classifiers by highlighting discriminative information.\nStatistical pooling Common pooling methods include max pooling and average pooling, which\nrespectively select the maximum value or compute the average value along a dimension. Introduced\nby [198], statistics pooling, employed in x-vector architectures with TDNN, calculates and concate-\nnates the mean and standard deviation of frame-level embeddings to generate an utterance-level\nrepresentation. An enhanced version, attentive statistics pooling (ASP), proposed in [173], incorpo-\nrates an attention mechanism into statistics pooling. ASP assigns channel-dependent weights to\neach frame, dynamically emphasizing the most informative frames during pooling. ASP has been\nutilized in various recent detection architectures [114, 151, 158].\nAttention In recent research, attention mechanisms have been integrated into classifier ar-\nchitectures such as LCNN and ResNet [84, 151, 153]. Well-known attention mechanisms include\nconvolutional block attention modules (CBAM) [236] and dual attention network (DANet)[64],\nwhich address both channel attention and spatial attention. CBAM comprises two sub-attention\nmodules in sequence, while DANet incorporates them in parallel. Zhou et al. [297] employ topK\npooling before computing attention weights across temporal and spatial dimensions, aimed at\npreserving a lightweight architecture. Rostami et al. [187] suggest adding a learnable attention\nmask to the channel dimension of the feature map.\n3.2.9\nOther Architectures. In addition to the commonly used architectures mentioned above,\nadvanced techniques like quantum neural networks are also being explored to address the problem\nof spoofed audio. Wang et al. [222] propose employing a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit network\nas the back-end classifier, utilizing feature maps extracted from the pre-trained WavLM-Large model.\nThey design a pipeline that utilizes Bi-LSTM to convert the feature maps into low-dimensional\nembedding vectors, which can be processed by the quantum circuit.\n3.2.10\nPerformance discussion on classifier selection. While the existing countermeasures have\nshown effectiveness in detecting fully spoofed audio, each classifier type comes with its own set\nof limitations that require attention, as outlined in TABLE 4. Employing ensemble methods can\nbe advantageous in addressing these limitations. For instance, CNN-based detectors are widely\nused for their proficiency in extracting local patterns, but they may struggle to capture long-term\ninformation. In such cases, ensembling with Transformer-based models can help in capturing global\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n17\ntemporal features. GATs excel in formulating inter-relationships among frame-level features, which\ncan lead to improved performance when combined with other CNN-based detectors. Additionally,\nDL-based classifiers may face challenges related to overfitting, resulting in poor performance if the\ntraining dataset is small or lacks diversity.\n3.3\nEnd-to-End (E2E) Architecture\nOne limitation of detection models with a two-stage architecture is their high dependency on\nextracted features. The performance of classifiers can vary significantly depending on the chosen\ninput features. Additionally, information lost during feature extraction is often irretrievable, such as\nthe neglect of phase information when using power spectrum features. Therefore, E2E architectures\nhave garnered more attention for audio anti-spoofing model development [37, 102, 267]. In E2E\nmodels, the entire process, from input to output, is encapsulated within a single network, eliminating\nthe need for separate front-end feature processing and back-end classifier engineering stages.\nHowever, many proposed architectures claimed as E2E models actually utilize a learnable SincNet\nfilter with fixed cutoff frequencies and Mel scales to extract a 2D spectral-temporal feature map.\nThe use of learnable cutoff frequencies in the audio anti-spoofing task may lead to overfitting, and\nthe pre-determined settings make them not truly representative of E2E models.\nMa et al. [155] present a genuinely E2E architecture by directly obtaining embedding from the\nraw waveform using a 1D convolutional layer with a kernel size of 3 followed by ResNet blocks.\nThey also enhance the model by incorporating a 1D convolutional layer and BN layer into the\nskip connection of ResNet blocks, thus extending the perceptual information range. Hua et al. [87]\nmodify the kernel size of the first 1D convolutional layer to 7 to capture longer-range dependencies.\nFang et al. [61] introduces an E2E model based on Res2Net blocks, wherein information from\nprevious subsegments undergoes another convolutional layer with a kernel size of 1 before being\nadded to the current subsegment. Conversely, the E2E ConvNet architecture proposed by [152]\nalternates between 1D convolutional layers and original Res2Net blocks, while appending a channel\nattention layer to the end of each Res2Net block, assigning channel-dependent weights.\n3.4\nTraining Optimization Techniques\nWe evaluate a range of training optimization techniques within the domains of data augmentation,\nloss function, and activation function. Through a comprehensive exploration of these techniques,\nwe aim to provide insights into their application and impact in enhancing the performance and\ngeneralization capabilities of audio anti-spoofing detection systems. TABLE 5 illustrates how inte-\ngrating specific optimization techniques into detection algorithms leads to detection performance\nimprovement.\n3.4.1\nData Augmentation (DA) techniques. DA techniques serve as indispensable tools to enhance\nthe robustness and diversity of datasets in training audio anti-spoofing models. This section assesses\nsome commonly used DA techniques, including masking, mix-up, and codec variation, along with\nother DA methods.\nMasking SpecAugment [176], initially introduced a DA method for speech recognition, involves\nrandomly masking blocks of frequency bins and/or blocks of time steps on spectrograms. Over\ntime, SpecAugment has been widely applied to improve the performance of anti-spoofing detectors\n[5, 33, 68, 109, 123, 257]. Additionally, [297] conducts experiments with random masking on the\ndimension of channels. Subsequently, SpecAverage [42] is proposed, to replace the random masking\nof the feature map with the average feature value rather than the value of zero.\nMix-up To prevent information loss on critical audio segments, Kim et al. [104] introduce a\ncut-and-mix technique, known as SpecMix. This method combines two data samples, where up\n18\nLi et al.\nTable 5.

For data augmentation, \"w/o\" means that no data augmentation techniques are applied, whereas \"with\"\ndenotes that only the specified data augmentation method is applied. For loss function, \"w/o\" means that the model utilizes the CE loss with\nSoftmax as the loss function, while \"with\" indicates that the loss function switches to the specified alternative. \u201c-\u201d indicates that the authors\ndo not report the performance with the corresponding dataset.\n\u2217Under \"with\", Center loss is incorporated alongside the CE loss with Softmax.\nto three frequency bins or temporal bands are masked on one sample. Then, the masked regions\nare replaced with features from another sample to create a new training sample. Notably, the label\nfor the new sample is determined through a weighted average of the labels from the two original\nsamples, with the weights assigned by the extent of the masked areas. SpecMix is effective to\nprevent overfitting and generalize to the unseen attack [58, 87, 213, 274]. Wang et al. [235] apply\nthe cut-and-mix technique to training utterances under the same label. However, determining the\npercentage of SpecMix over the entire training set is crucial. Experimental results indicate that\neither entirely omitting SpecMix operations or uniformly applying SpecMix to all data can lead to\nperformance degradation [58].\nCodec augmentation This technique is utilized to replicate compression algorithms used in\nencoding audio signals, thereby enhancing the model\u2019s robustness to unseen coding and trans-\nmission artifacts, especially in datasets like ASVspoof2021-LA set [8, 46, 47, 49, 62, 243]. Codec\naugmentation can be categorized into two main types: multimedia encoding and transmission\nencoding. In multimedia encoding, raw audio is transformed into various codecs such as MP3,\nM4A, MP2, OGG, and AAC, each with different sampling rates, before being resampled back to\n16kHz. Transmission encoding involves employing multiple Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)\nor telephony transformation techniques, such as G.711, G.726, Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband\n(AMR-WB), and GSM, with varying bitrates. [42] simulates the random packet loss as augmentation.\nMeanwhile, [116, 213] apply band-pass finite impulse response (FIR) filters to mimic speech codec,\nwhich may cause information loss at specific frequency bands.\nOther commonly used DA techniques include speed perturbation [223], time stretching [27],\npitch shifting [27], addition of noise and room impulse responses (RIRs) [170, 206], and generation\nof new spoofed audio samples using various vocoders [223]. It is common practice to combine\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n19\nmultiple DA techniques, involving both online and offline implementations, to further enhance the\nmodel\u2019s robustness [13, 33, 115, 240]. However, experiment results indicate that the effectiveness of\nDA techniques may be feature-dependent or dataset-dependent. For instance, channel simulation,\nwhich includes applying codecs, adding additive noise and RIRs, does not perform well for LFCC-\nbased anti-spoofing models [293] but is effective for models utilizing features pre-trained with\nwav2vec 2.0 [132].\nFurthermore, DA may lead to data pollution when the augmented samples do not accurately\nrepresent the diversity of real-world conditions. To address this data pollution issue, Lin et al.\n[132] implement split batch normalization (SBN) within the conventional LCNN blocks, where\nthe BN layer is split into the main branch and an auxiliary branch, allowing the main branch to\nprocess weakly augmented training data and the auxiliary branch to handle strongly augmented\ndata concurrently. By doing so, it prevents the main branch from being affected by data pollution\ncaused by DA during the inference stage.\n3.4.2\nLoss function. The selection of loss functions is also crucial to detection performance. The\ncross-entropy (CE) loss with Softmax is the most widely used loss function for audio anti-spoofing\ntasks, which consists of a fully-connected (FC) layer, the Softmax function and the cross-entropy loss.\nResearchers also have proposed numerous variants to address specific tasks for audio anti-spoofing.\nWe introduce all loss functions mentioned in the literature with the formula provided.\nCross-entropy (CE) loss with Softmax Softmax is applied to generate a probability distribution\nover the classes. In most anti-spoofing tasks, the number of classes is typically limited to two: bona\nfide and spoofed. The formula of binary version of CE loss with Softmax is given as:\nL\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc38= \u22121\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\nlog\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc98\u22a4\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc98\u22a4\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56+ \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc98\u22a4\n1\u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56\n= \u22121\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\nlog(1 + \ud835\udc52(\ud835\udc981\u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u22a4\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56),\n(1)\nwhere \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56\u2208R\ud835\udc37and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2208{0, 1} are the feature embedding and the corresponding label, respectively.\n\ud835\udc980,\ud835\udc981 \u2208R\ud835\udc37are the weight vectors for bona fide and spoofed classes, and \ud835\udc41is the batch size.\nAdditive Margin (AM)-Softmax It introduces a margin \ud835\udc5ain angular space to make both\nclasses\u2019 embedding distributions more compact and encourage larger angular distances between\nfeature vectors of different classes:\nL\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc40= \u22121\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\nlog\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56+\ud835\udc5a))\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56+\ud835\udc5a)) + \ud835\udc52\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udf031\u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)) ,\n(2)\nwhere \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56= \u02c6\ud835\udc98\u22a4\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u02c6\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56is the cosine distance between length normalized vector, \u02c6\ud835\udc98, \u02c6\ud835\udc99are the\nnormalized \ud835\udc98and \ud835\udc99, and \ud835\udefcis a scale factor.\nLarge Margin Cosine loss (LMCL) The LMCL also aims to maximize the inter-class variance\nand minimize the intra-class variance.

[287] point out that employing a uniform compact margin for both genuine and spoofed\nspeech can lead to overfitting to known attacks. Therefore, OC-Softmax is proposed, which uses\ntwo different margins, \ud835\udc5a0 and \ud835\udc5a1, to compact the genuine speech as well as simultaneously isolate\nthe spoofing speech. OC-Softmax is denoted as:\nL\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc36= \u22121\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\nlog(1 + \ud835\udc52\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\u02c6\ud835\udc980 \u02c6\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56(\u22121)\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)).\n(4)\nSeveral comparative studies have been conducted to demonstrate the generalizability of OC-\nSoftmax, particularly towards unknown attacks [82, 158]. Moreover, recent efforts have concentrated\non enhancing OC-Softmax even further. Ding et al. [54] propose speaker attractor multicenter\none-class learning (SAMO), which aims to construct multiple clusters for bonafide utterances based\non individual speakers, rather than clustering all bonafide speeches into one group. The SAMO is\ndefined as:\nL\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc42= \u22121\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\nlog(1 + \ud835\udc52\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56) (\u22121)\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56),\n(5)\nwhere \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56is computed by\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56=\n(\n\u02c6\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\u02c6\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56\nif \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56= 0\nmax\n\ud835\udc60\n( \u02c6\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc60\u02c6\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56),\ud835\udc60\u2208S\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\nif \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56= 1.\nHere, \ud835\udc60represents individual speaker, and \u02c6\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56is the normalized speaker vector. Ren et al. [185] add\na dispersion loss specifically tailored for spoofed samples to the OC-Softmax. This addition aims to\nmake the real speech space more compact than the originals, thereby encouraging known spoofing\nsamples to cover the entire spoofing space. As a result, unknown spoofing attacks are more likely\nto be classified within the spoofing space.\nMean Square Error (MSE) The margin-based loss is sensitive to the hyper-parameter settings.\nWang et al. [226] suggest utilizing the MSE between the model detection output and the ground\ntruth, as a hyperparameter-free loss function:\nL\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc38= \u22121\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\n\ud835\udc36\u22121\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc58=0\n( \u02c6\ud835\udc98\u22a4\n\ud835\udc58\u02c6\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56\u22121(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc58))2.\n(6)\nwhere \ud835\udc36indicates the total number of classes.\nTriplet loss Triplet loss is utilized to project audio samples into an embedding space. Samples\nsharing the same labels are brought closer together, determined by the Euclidean distance, while\nthose with differing labels are distanced by a specified margin. The formula for Triplet loss is shown\nas Eq. 7.\nL\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56=\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\n||\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc56)||2\n2 \u2212||\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc56)||2\n2 + \ud835\udefc,\n(7)\nwhere \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc56represent the anchor sample, \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc56is a positive sample of the same class as anchor sample, \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc56\nis a negative sample of a different class from anchor sample, \ud835\udc53(\u00b7) extracts embedding representations\nfor each sample, and \ud835\udefcis a pre-defined margin. In the context of audio anti-spoofing, Triplet loss is\ntypically combined with other objective functions [211, 247].\nFocal loss Focal loss is another common objective function for audio anti-spoofing tasks,\nespecially when dealing with data imbalance during the training stage. The focal loss can be\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n21\nformulated by Eq. 9.\nL\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59= \u2212(1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udefelog(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61).\n(8)\nIt adds (1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udefeto the standard CE loss, where \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61is the predicted probability of the genuine class\nand \ud835\udefecontrols the rate at which the loss for well-classified examples is down-weighted.\nCenter loss Huang et al. [88] propose to integrate Center loss alongside the CE loss to minimize\nintra-class variability of deep embeddings. This addition is significant because the CE loss primarily\nfocuses on capturing inter-class differences. The definition of Center loss is indicated as follows:\nL\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f= 1\n2\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\n||\ud835\udc98\u22a4\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56||2\n2,\n(9)\nwhere \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56is the centroid of the class to which the \ud835\udc56-th input data belongs.\n3.4.3\nActivation function. Research has explored modifying the activation functions as well. Kang\net al. [98] conduct experiments with multiple E2E models and find that the learnable activation\nfunctions, such as parametric-ReLU (PReLU) [86] and Attention-ReLU (ARelu) [31], improve the per-\nformance greater than non-learnable activation functions. Additionally, ensembling both learnable\nand non-learnable activation functions by addition, including ReLU, AReLU, PReLU, LeakyReLU,\nand ELU, outperforms using any single one of the activation functions solely [97].\n4\nTRAINING AND ROBUSTNESS ADVANCEMENTS IN FULLY SPOOFED DETECTION\nIn addition to focusing on detection accuracy, numerous research efforts have been directed toward\nenhancing the model\u2019s robustness, efficiency, and interpretability. In the following section, we will\nintroduce recent advances in these research directions.\n4.1\nTraining strategies\nVarious training techniques have been proposed to address challenges such as model complexity,\ndata scarcity, and computational efficiency. For instance, Xie et al. [249] leverage the Siamese\nnetwork on SOTA architectures like LCNN, ResNet-18, and SE-Net, to learn a more compact and\nmeaningful representation for audio samples without increasing the number of parameters. Notably,\nthe Siamese network also demonstrates effectiveness in highly unbalanced datasets. Except for the\nSiamese network, Low-Rank Adaption and knowledge distillation are also widely adopted in audio\nanti-spoofing to transfer knowledge to a more efficient detection structure.\nLow-Rank Adaption (LoRA) LoRA is an efficient transfer learning method that introduces\ntwo low-rank adaptive matrices specifically trained for new downstream tasks or domains [285].\nCompared to traditional transfer learning methods [5, 202], LoRA provides a low-cost incremental\nlearning process and prevents catastrophic forgetting by keeping the entire parameters of the\nsource model unchanged. Wang et al. [219] incorporate LoRA into the multi-head attention module\nwithin the wav2vec 2.0 Transformer structure. This integration aims to produce a new set of deep\nembeddings better adapted to the data in various domains.\nKnowledge Distillation (KD) The large-scale detection models make them difficult to deploy on\nedge devices with limited memory and computational power. KD is proposed to capture knowledge\nin a complex detection architecture into a smaller, single model that is much easier to deploy without\nsignificant loss in performance [130, 185]. Xue et al. [251] introduce a self-distillation apporach,\nwhere the student model is trained to learn prediction-based knowledge through computing\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss of Softmax outputs between students and teachers, as well\nas feature-based knowledge by computing the MSE loss between feature maps of students and\nteachers. Lu et al. [145] propose an offline distillation method that freezes the parameters of the\nteacher model to train the student model, while the student model is trained only on bonafide\n22\nLi et al.\ndata to maximize learning of the genuine speech feature space. Ren et al. [184] suggest that online\ndistillation could enable the student model to learn extra knowledge from mutual learning with the\nteacher model.\n4.2\nInterpretability of results\nSeveral existing works have leveraged explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools [9] to uncover\nthe behaviour of deep neural network algorithms in detecting spoofed audio. Ge et al. [72] is the\nfirst effort to utilize SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [146] scores to explain detection results\non the ASVspoof2019-LA dataset, by testing on speech and non-speech intervals and different\nsubbands. The observation reveals that the classifier has learned to focus on non-speech intervals\nand highlighted the attention at the low-frequency sub-band at 0.5-0.6kHz. Lim et al. [131] apply\nboth Deep Taylor [164] and layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) [19] to learn the attribution\nscore of audio formats in spectrograms. Furthermore, the Gradient-weighted Class Activation\nMapping (Grad-CAM) [191] is used in [111, 207] to identify the significant frequency ranges in the\nspectrogram.\n4.3\nDefense to adversarial attacks\n[136] has shown that the majority of anti-spoofing models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,\nsuch as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [78] and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) [156],\nespecially when dealing with models of smaller scales. In response, various defence strategies have\nbeen proposed, primarily based on adversarial training, where anti-spoofing models are retrained\nusing the adversarial examples generated by the PGD method [241] or the FGSM method [75, 170].\n[171] claims that attackers may focus on the range beyond human perception to maximize the\nattack effectiveness, therefore, they suggest augmenting training data with frequency band-pass\nfiltering and denoising to defend such attacks. Furthermore, Liao et al. [130] utilize knowledge\ndistillation as another defence method. This is because the soft targets learned by the student\nmodels capture more nuanced information about the decision boundary, enhancing robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks.\n4.4\nRobustness on cross-dataset\nThere are two practical scenarios involving multi-dataset. One is multi-dataset co-training, where\ndatasets from different domains are combined as training data. Co-training encourages the training\nmodels to learn information from all provided domains. The other one is cross-dataset evaluation,\nwhere models trained on a specific dataset are tested on various out-of-domain datasets. This\nevaluation method helps assess the robustness and generalizability of models across different data\ndomains.\nMulti-dataset co-training The experiments indicate that simply combining data from different\ndomains does not guarantee an increase in the generalization of detection models due to domain\nmismatch. To address this challenge, Shim et al. [194] propose a gradient-based method that\nconsiders reducing the curvature of neighbourhoods in the loss surface while minimizing the loss\nfunction. It effectively reduces the gap between variances of multi-domain datasets. Zhang et al.\n[286] adopt the Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM) to overcome the catastrophic\nforgetting problem caused by finetuning a trained model with an out-of-domain dataset. Wang\net al. [229] use the negative energy-based certainty score [138] to evaluate the usefulness of each\ndata in the pool consisting of datasets from various domains. They then employ the active learning\ntechnique to select the useful data to be the training data for fine-tuning.\nCross-dataset evaluation Muller et al. [165] evaluate several SOTA anti-spoofing detection\nmodels trained using the ASVspoof2019-LA dataset on the ITW dataset. The results reveal a\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n23\nTable 6.

The reported evaluation results on both datasets are produced by the student model.\nsignificant performance decline, with some models showing random guessing behaviour. [293]\nsuggests the performance degradation may be due to the channel effect mismatch among different\ndatasets, as evidenced by variations in the average spectra magnitude for each dataset. To address\nthis issue, an additional channel classifier with a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) is added in [293]\nas a discriminator, making the detecting model more robust to channel variation while preserving\nits discriminative power in spoofing detection. Recently, GRL has been widely used for domain\nadaptation in cross-dataset, and cross-language detections, encouraging models to learn domain-\ninvariant representations [11, 299]. Besides, Salvi et al. [189] introduce a sub-network consisting of\nthree layers of FC, dropout, BN, and LeakyReLU, operating in parallel to the detection classifier\nstructure as a reliability estimator. This estimator evaluates each segment of the input audio,\nensuring that all input segments contributing to the detection decision are both discriminative and\nrobust enough. Segments considered insufficiently reliable are discarded from the training stage.\nAccording to Table 6, the knowledge distillation technique significantly improves the generalizability\nof student models in cross-dataset evaluations.\n5\nINTEGRATION OF ASV TO ANTI-SPOOFING COUNTERMEASURES\nWhile existing anti-spoofing algorithms have demonstrated the effectiveness of detecting TTS\nor VC attacks, even under telephony or various codec conditions, the reliability of ASV systems\nremains vulnerable. ASV systems have been used as a biometric authentication technique, which\nnot only requires detecting the authentication of the speech clips but also needs to verify the\nidentity of speakers. The relationship between anti-spoofing CMs and ASV systems has been shown\nin Figure 1. Therefore, there is a need to integrate the ASV functionality into the anti-spoofing\narchitectures.\nThe spoofing-aware speaker verification (SASV) challenge has been launched to encourage\nthe development of single models which can detect the speech spoken by different speakers and\nspoofed speech [94]. Based on the challenge protocols, the VoxCeleb2 and the ASVspoof2019-LA\ndatabase are used for training. The primary metric for evaluation is the SASV-EER, which treats\nbonafide speech from the target speaker as positive cases and all others as negative. The secondary\n24\nLi et al.\nAnti-spoofing \nCountermeasure (CM)\nAutomatic Speaker \nVerification system (ASV)\n Spoofed speech\nASV attacks\nBona fide Speaker\nFig. 1.

Each category is\ndiscussed in the following.\nCascaded systems The cascaded system is the concatenation of the ASV and CM classifiers,\nboth of which are pre-trained. Wang et al. [225] propose a cascaded system beginning with an ASV\nbinary classifier followed by the CM detector. The ASV and CM modules are trained separately.\nDuring testing, only the test audio labelled positive by the ASV classifier will be passed to the second\nCM module. However, they also find that the order of the modules affects the output performance.\nScore-level Fusion Score-level fusion indicates that combining the individual scores from the\nASV and CM classifiers to generate an ensemble score for the SASV system. Shim et al. [195] use a\nscore-sum fusion technique to integrate the ASV and CM sub-systems, serving as the baseline for\nthe SASV challenge. Zhang et al. [292] introduce a probabilistic framework based on the product\nrule, that leverages scores from the ASV and CM subsystems, further enhancing the score-sum\nfusion baseline. Wu et al. [238] suggest that the baseline does not consider the disparity in scale\nranges between ASV and CM scores, so they utilize a fusion technique that concatenates scores\nfrom multiple sub-CM models and sub-ASV models before passing them to the prediction layer.\nThis approach is refined in [242], by applying the average pooling to CM embeddings to obtain a\nsingle CM score for concatenation with the rest of the sub-ASV scores. Utilizing the score-level\nfusion with the pooling strategy allows for flexible adjustment of the model\u2019s scale. [282] addresses\nthe inconsistent score distribution of the CM and ASV subsystems by utilizing the L2-normalized\ninner product for speaker embeddings. Alenin et al. [5] use quality measurements of audio files,\nsuch as speech length and mean value of CM system scores, to penalize the ASV and CM scores. It\nhelps to normalize target and impostor distributions.\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n25\nTable 7.

The bold values refer to the best performance of each\nsubcategory\nFeature Embedding-level Fusion Feature-level fusion involves either the concatenation of\nthe ASV and CM embeddings from their extractors or the extraction of an integrated embedding\nto represent both ASV and CM information. Another baseline of the SASV challenge mentioned\nin [195] is to fuse the embeddings from the ASV and CM module together by concatenation and\npass them into a simple DNN-based classifier containing three FC layers. Zhang et al. [277] apply\ncirculant matrix transformation to ASV and CM embeddings before stacking them together. Parallel\nattention and SE attention are added to the back-end classifier to learn the global relationship\nbetween these two embeddings. In [290], the authors propose a \u201ctotal-divide-total\u201d structure, adding\na dual-branch network to a pre-trained ASV system. After the global feature aggregation, two\nparallel branches extract the ASV embedding and CM embeddings separately by independent\ntraining. This model keeps the parameters of the pre-trained backbone fixed during the training\n26\nLi et al.\nof CM branch, which reduces training time, however, the resulting performance is not quite as\ncompetitive as other SOTA. Choi et al. [38] want to reform speaker embedding to integrate the\ninformation from CM embeddings, rather than simply applying the concatenation or stacking.\nThe FiLM [178] technique is utilized to obtain the spoofing-aware speaker embedding (SASE),\nconditioning on both speaker and CM embeddings through affine transformation.\nIn previously mentioned models, embeddings are separately optimized. However, Ge et al.\n[73] introduces the concept of joint optimization, by updating the ASV, CM embeddings and the\nback classifier simultaneously. They suggest that through joint optimization, the strength of one\nsubsystem may compensate for the weaknesses of the other [74].\nIntegrated/ E2E system Mun et al. [167] propose a multi-stage training scheme on a multi-scale\nfeature aggregation Conformer (MFA-Conformer) to obtain an SASV embedding directly rather than\nusing separate ASV and CM models. The embedding encoder captures the mutual characteristics of\nASV and CM throughout the multiple training and fine-tuning. This design not only contributes to\ndeveloping a single integrated system for the SASV task but also addresses the lack of spoofed data,\nreducing the impact of data imbalance. However, its computational cost has yet to be discussed\nin the literature. In the E2E model proposed by [211], spoofed audios are labelled as TTS and VC\nseparately, based on their generating methods, while bonafide audios receive different labels based\non the speaker\u2019s identity. The boundaries between different labels also be distinct. Kang et al. [96]\nmodify the AM-Softmax loss by considering CM labels into account, to fine-tune the pre-trained\nASV system. Liu et al. [141] experiment several domain adaptation techniques, such as Probabilistic\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) [22] and CORAL [203], to transform speaker embeddings to\nadapt to the new domain of spoofing attacks.\n5.2\nPerformance discussion on SASV models\nBased on the same training and evaluation datasets, the performance of the SOTA methods is\npresented in Table 7. Currently, the SOTAs still highly rely on the capability of independent ASV\nand CM subsystems. Surprisingly, according to the EER metrics, simple ensemble mechanisms, such\nas score-fusion and cascaded systems, achieve a better performance than a single integrated SASV\nsystem. However, directly concatenating and stacking the ASV and CM embeddings reduces the\nability of speaker verification, as reflected by SV-EER, even though feature-level fusion algorithms\nhave less false alarm rate than cascaded systems. These results suggest that a single system\nmay require a new latent space to effectively represent both speakers and spoofing information.\nTherefore, the future direction should focus on joint optimization and the development of an\nintegrated SASV system to improve overall performance.\n6\nPARTIALLY SPOOFED DETECTION\nPartially spoofed utterance can be created by inserting one or more clips of synthetic speech into\nthe original real speech, such as changing some words within one expression. The series of the\nASVspoof Challenges does not currently address this type of spoofed speech. The PF attack was\ninitially introduced in the ADD 2022 Challenge [265], and in ADD 2023 [266], this challenge was\nextended to not only detect manipulated intervals but also localize the boundaries within the\nutterance.\nBoth the ADD 2022 and 2023 challenges provide testing datasets for the partially spoofed track.\nThe primary difference in ADD2023 PF datasets, compared to ADD2022, is that ADD2023 provides\nthe ground truth labels for both utterance level and segment level, which allows for the evaluation\nof accuracy in localizing fake segments within the utterance. Consequently, the primary evaluation\nmetric for the ADD2022 PF dataset is utterance-level EER. In contrast, the key evaluation metric\nfor the ADD2023 PF dataset is a weighted sum of utterance-level accuracy and frame-level F1 score.\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n27\nTable 8.

The evaluation metric for ADD2023-PF dataset is a weighted sum of\nutterance-level accuracy and frame-level F1 score. \u201c\u2193\u201d indicates that a lower score corresponds to better detection performance, while \"\u2191\"\nmeans the opposite. \"-\u201d indicates that the authors do not report the performance with the corresponding dataset. The bold values refer to the\nbest performance on the same dataset.\nAdditionally, the PartialSpoof dataset, another widely used partially spoofed dataset derived from\nthe ASVspoof2019 set, also offers both utterance-level and segment-level ground truth and utilizes\nEER as the main metrics. The latest literature, evaluated using the mentioned datasets along with\ntheir corresponding metrics, is summarized and presented in TABLE 8.\n6.1\nSOTA models for partially spoofed detection\nThe SOTA for detecting partially spoofed speeches can be categorized into three main categories:\nframe-level detection, multi-task learning strategies, and boundary detection.\nFrame-level The speech can be divided into small segments and the frame-level detection\nalgorithms assign a genuine or spoofed label to each segment. Kumar et al. [108] utilize the GMM to\ncalculate the log-likelihood score for each frame and assign frame-level labels. Originally designed\nto detect full fake audio, this system has shown potential for detecting partially spoofed speech.\n[180] and [281] also attempt to calculate the frame-level score by utilizing the PLDA classifier,\nLCNN backbone with Bi-LSTM for smoothing.\nThe frame-level algorithms often face the challenge of identifying small frames as spoofed within\ngenuine segments. However, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that the manipulated part of the attacked\nspeech should be longer than just a few frames, especially when using a small frame size. For\ninstance, the spoofed segment should ideally be no shorter than the duration of a phoneme. Zhang\net al. [275] propose a swap algorithm to switch labels when only one fake frame occurs between\nreal labels in the sequence, and vice versa. This approach obtains longer spoofed segments. [159]\nsuggests that the wav2vec 2.0 SSL-based feature tends to detect artifacts on the boundaries in the\ninserted clips as spoofed frames. Therefore, in their post-processing strategies, spoofed frames\nwork as boundary indicators. For example, if two non-consecutive short segments are identified\nas spoofed, the intermediate segments are also labelled as spoofed. If only one short segment is\n28\nLi et al.\ndetected as fake, acting as a boundary between two segments, the longer segment is labelled as\ngenuine and the shorter one is labelled as spoofed. Liu et al. [134] introduce an isolated-frame\npenalty term in the loss function to deal with outliers. Differences between each frame and its\nsurrounding frames are calculated, and these differences are then summed up to form a regularity\nconstraint in the loss function.\nMulti-task In addition to the frame-level labels, utterance-level labels are also considered during\nthe training process, as multi-task learning. Zhang et al. [280] first implement multi-task learning\nframeworks to construct a binary-branch structure, where frame-level and utterance-level tasks\nhave individual classifiers and loss functions after the jointly embedding encoder. Li et al. [122] also\nutilize a fused loss function with a sum of frame-level and clip-level CE loss, where the utterance-\nlevel label is calculated by the weighted average on the frame-level labels. Instead of employing a\nfused loss function for both frame-level and utterance-level detection, [118] integrates two back-end\nmodels, ASSIST and wav2vec 2.0. This decision is based on the authors\u2019 observation that ASSIST\ntends to misidentify spoofed segments, while wav2vec 2.0 exhibits a bias towards the real class.\nTherefore, the proposed model combines the detection results from AASIST at the utterance level\nand wav2vec 2.0 at the frame level.\nBoundary detection The method of boundary detection aims to identify the transition bound-\naries between genuine and spoofed segments. Wu et al. [239] add one FC layer as the question-\nanswer (QA) layer to assess each frame\u2019s potential as the start or end position of the fake clips.\nSoftmax is applied as a QA loss function, and the QA loss and CE loss are summed up for training.\nThe model proposed by [239] achieved second place in the PF track of the ADD 2022 Challenge.\nUtilizing boundary detection can address post-processing needs in frame-level score-based\nalgorithms. Cai et al. [24] train two systems with identical architecture for the task of boundary\ndetection and frame-level detection respectively. The scores from the boundary detection system\nare utilized as a reference to determine the outline frame labels. The proposed model achieves the\nfirst rank in the PF track of ADD 2023.\n6.2\nPerformance discussion on partially spoofed detection\nRecent research has reached a consensus that the manipulations of PF speech mostly occur in\nthe time domain, resulting in the presence of more artifacts. As a result, incorporating a RNN\narchitecture [122, 159, 281] into the detector structure is preferred to leverage temporal information.\nRNNs can also provide global information to CNNs, which are limited by their fixed receptive\nregion. Additionally, SSL features with fine-tuning [140, 149, 237, 278] are widely utilized in PF\ndetection due to their effectiveness in capturing temporal domain characteristics.\nManipulated segments in PF utterances can be either spoofed segments or some arbitrary\nreal segments from other speakers. Some work has been done to address the problem of speaker\nverification in the PF case. For example, the cluster module in [159] and the Variational Autoencoder\nmodule [24] work as a supplementary speaker verification system to detect outliers. However, the\ncurrent testing datasets have not included scenarios involving real segments from other speakers,\nmaking it challenging to verify the effectiveness of these implementations at this stage.\n7\nCURRENT CHALLENGE AND FUTURE WORK\nAside from the efforts of all presented works in improving detection performance, generalization,\ninterpretability, and robustness, there are certain limitations in the current work that need to be\naddressed. This section summarizes the challenges observed in the review and provides future\ndirections for audio anti-spoofing detection development.\nReproducibility of detection models Only around 10% of journal or conference papers in the\nfield of audio anti-spoofing offer source code for replication. Particularly concerning is the absence\nAudio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey\n29\nof vital information related to model training, such as loss functions and hyperparameter configu-\nrations, in some publications. Enhancing reproducibility is essential for advancing research in the\nfuture and ensuring the reliability of findings. The transparency of detection models encourages\nresearchers to build upon previous work and to improve the quality of models by identifying and\neliminating errors, inconsistencies, or biases in prior research.\nDiversity of available datasets The predominant research lies on datasets in the ASVspoof\nseries. Even though more new datasets like ITW, and WaveFake have been developing, there remains\na substantial gap between these experimental datasets and the realistic conditions encountered in\ndaily life. Therefore, there is an emerging need for developing real-world datasets that encompass a\nwide range of conditions, including speaker diversity, spoofing generation techniques, transmission\nchannels, environmental factors, sound effects, noise distortion, and language variations, for both\nfully and partially spoofed scenarios.\nCross-dataset generalization Along with the development of dataset diversity, the anti-\nspoofing models should gain the capability to generalize effectively across multiple datasets and\ndomains. Leveraging transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques represents a promising\ndirection as future work for improving the generalization on unseen spoofing attacks, audio condi-\ntions and diverse languages while preserving the discriminative power on the known conditions.\nInterpretability of detection results The current stage of exploring the interpretability of\ndetection results is typically achieved by applying various XAI tools to the trained models. However,\nit is also nontrivial to consider both detection performance and outcome concurrently in the\ndesign of detection architectures. Employing techniques like attention mechanisms, and feature\nvisualization provides insights into the underlying decision-making process of spoofing detections.\nImproving the interpretability of detection results ultimately enhances trust in audio anti-spoofing\nsystems.\nRobustness to adversarial attacks Most of the existing approaches to defending adversarial\nattacks depend on adversarial training, which generates adversarial samples on known attacks to\nretrain the model, requiring expensive computational costs. Future directions can be deploying\ngenerator-and-discriminator mechanisms to learn from domain-invariant attacks. Furthermore,\ninvestigating adversarial attacks across different modalities may uncover potential vulnerabilities\nand enhance the resilience of current models.\nStreaming / Real-time detection Not much research has worked on real-time detection,\nincluding fake phone calls, IoT edge devices or other low-latency conditions. It requires detection\nmodels to be computationally efficient. Techniques like model pruning, distributed computing, and\nreal-time incremental learning can be integrated into audio anti-spoofing systems.\nPrivacy preservation The development and deployment of real-time anti-spoofing detection\nsystems on smart devices have the potential to raise privacy concerns regarding access to users\u2019\nbiometric data and model parameters. To address these concerns, privacy-preserving techniques\nlike secure multiparty computation can be incorporated to limit access from both the client and\nserver sides.\nDetection source tracing It is nontrivial to trace and identify the spoofing tools or audio\nfabricating algorithms while developing anti-spoofing technologies. By categorizing attributes\nassociated with spoofing attacks, we not only enhance our understanding of spoofing system\narchitecture but also generate potential forensic evidence to preserve the trustworthiness of anti-\nspoofing decisions.\n8\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, this survey reviews the advanced audio anti-spoofing algorithms, including the key\naspects of model architecture, training techniques, application scenarios, and available datasets.\n30\nLi et al.\nAlthough there are many surveys about audio anti-spoofing, they mostly focus on listing out all\nproposed model architectures without considering the intrinsic connection from other elements in\nthe detection pipeline. This survey is the first one, which provides a comprehensive review of all\nstages of audio anti-spoofing. We present a detailed comparison and discussion of current advances\nin feature engineering and classifier design across diverse detection applications. Additionally,\nwe evaluate the effectiveness of optimization techniques applied in the model training process,\nincluding data augmentation techniques, activation functions and loss functions. We provide the\nperformance evaluation and open-source information of state-of-the-art, which fosters strong\nbaseline selections in future experiments. Lastly, we analyze the current challenges and summarize\nsome promising research directions for future work. We hope this survey serves as a guide and\ngives insight into future development for preventing malicious spoofed audio in depth.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P Abdzadeh and Hadi Veisi. 2023.

INTRODUCTION\nWith Web 3.0 still in its blooming stage [1], Arti\ufb01cial\nIntelligence (AI)1 has proven to be an effective tool for many\nchallenging tasks, such as generating content, classi\ufb01cation\nand understanding. In recent years, some advancements within\nAI have helped the technology complete more complex tasks\nThis research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foun-\ndation of China (Nos. 62002136 and 62272196), Natural Science Foundation\nof Guangdong Province (No. 2022A1515011861), Fundamental Research\nFunds for the Central Universities of Jinan University (No. 21622416), the\nYoung Scholar Program of Pazhou Lab (No. PZL2021KF0023), Engineering\nResearch Center of Trustworthy AI, Ministry of Education (Jinan University),\nand Guangdong Key Laboratory for Data Security and Privacy Preserving.\nJiayang Wu, Wensheng Gan, Zefeng Chen, and Hong Lin are with the\nCollege of Cyber Security, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China;\nand also with Pazhou Lab, Guangzhou 510330, China.

Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)\nis a new content creation method that complements traditional\ncontent creation approaches like Professional Generated Con-\ntent (PGC) and User Generated Content (UGC) [2], [3]. AIGC\ngenerates content according to AI technology to meet the\nrequirements of users. It is supposed to be a promising tech-\nnology with numerous applications. Understanding AIGC\u2019s\ncapabilities and limitations, therefore, is critical to exploring\nits full potential.\nThe first \nstage\n\u2022\nThe \u201c1 The Road\u201d is the \nthe world's first novel \ncompletely created by \nartificial intelligence.\n\u2022\nMicrosoft showcased a fully \nautomatic simultaneous \ninterpretation system.\n\u2022\nThe world's first computer-\ncompleted music, \u201cIliac \nSuite\u201d.\n\u2022\nThe world's first human-\ncomputer interactive robot, \n\u201cEliza''.\nThe second \nstage\nThe third \nstage\n\u2022\nGoodfellow  proposed GAN, \nwhich can use existing data \nto generate pictures.\n\u2022\nIn this year, OpenAI \nreleased a new chat robot \nmodel, called ChatGPT.\nFig. 1: Three stages of AIGC.\nActually, the origins of AIGC can be traced back to an\nearlier time. The development history can be roughly divided\ninto three stages (as shown in Fig. 1). In the \ufb01rst stage, re-\nsearchers control the computer to realize the output of content\nthrough the most primitive programming technology. Hiller\nand Isaacson completed the world\u2019s \ufb01rst computer-completed\nmusic, Iliac Suite2, in 1957. Then, the world\u2019s \ufb01rst human-\ncomputer interactive robot, Eliza3, came out. Eliza shows\nthe ability to search for appropriate answers through pattern\nmatching and intelligent phrases but does not re\ufb02ect a semantic\nunderstanding. However, most people still regard Eliza as the\nsources of inspiration for AI nowadays. During the next two\ndecades, it was the stage of sedimentation accumulation. The\nsecond stage assumes AIGC progress as usability as a result of\nthe increased availability of massive databases and advance-\nments in computing equipment performance. The Road4 is\nthe world\u2019s \ufb01rst novel completely created by AI. After that,\nMicrosoft also demonstrated a fully automatic simultaneous\ninterpretation system, which is capable of translating speech\nfrom English to Chinese in a short time with high accuracy [4].\nHowever, the bottleneck of algorithms directly limits AIGC\u2019s\nability to generate rich content. The third stage began in 2010\nwhen AIGC entered a rapid development phase. Goodfellow\n[5] proposed a Generic Adversarial Network (GAN), which\nuses existing data to generate pictures. In 2022, OpenAI\n2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiac Suite\n3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA\n4https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1 the Road\narXiv:2304.06632v1  [cs.AI]  26 Mar 2023\n2\nreleased a new chat robot model, called ChatGPT. It is\ncapable of understanding human language and generating text\nlike humans do. Monthly active users exceeded 100 million\nwithin two months. There were about 13 million independent\nvisitors using ChatGPT per day in January 20235. With the\nimprovement of products (like ChatGPT), AIGC has shown\ngreat potential for applications and commercial value. It has\nattracted a lot of attention from various domains, including\nentrepreneurs, investors, scholars, and the public.\nAt present, the quality of AIGC content is signi\ufb01cantly\nbetter than it was before. Furthermore, the types of AIGC\ncontent have been enriched, including text, images, video,\ncode, etc. Table I lists some AIGC models or classic products\ndeveloped by major technology companies, as well as their\ncorresponding applications. ChatGPT6 is a machine learning\nsystem based on the Large Language Model (LLM)7. After\nbeing trained on humorous large text datasets, LLM not only\nexcels at generating reasonable dialogue but also produces\ncompelling pieces (e.g., stories and articles). Thanks to its\nunique human feedback training process, ChatGPT is able to\ncomprehend human thinking with greater precision. Google\nclaims their upcoming product, Bard8 will have the same fea-\ntures but focus more on generating conversations. Compared to\nChatGPT, Bard can make use of external knowledge sources,\nwhich can help users solve problems by providing answers\nto natural language questions instead of search results. In\naddition, Microsoft\u2019s Turning-NLG9 is an LLM with 17 billion\nparameters, and it is applied to summarization, translation, and\nquestion-answering.\nThe Diffusion model is a cutting-edge method in the \ufb01eld\nof image generation. Its simplicity of interaction and fast\ngeneration features signi\ufb01cantly lower the barriers to entry.\nSeveral popular applications, such as Disco Diffusion10, Stable\nDiffusion11, and Midjourney12, have generated exponential\nsocial media discussions and showcases of work. NVIDIA is\na pioneer in visual generation research. Their product (i.e.,\nStyleGAN) is a state-of-the-art approach to high-resolution\nimage synthesis, specializing in image generation, art, and de-\nsign. In addition, because of the distinct requirements for gen-\nerating pictures within different industries, StyleGAN provides\nopportunities for several startups. For example, Looka focuses\non logo and website design, and Lensa focuses on avatar\ngeneration. GAN is already capable of generating extremely\nrealistic images. DeepMind is trying to apply it to the \ufb01eld of\ngenerating videos. Their proposed model, called Dual Video\nDiscriminator GAN (DVD-GAN) [6], can generate longer\nand higher resolution videos using computationally ef\ufb01cient\ndiscriminator decomposition. DVD-GAN is an exploration of\nrealistic video generation.\n5https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/\nchatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app\n6https://chat.openai.com/\n7https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large Language Mode\n8https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/\n9https://turing.microsoft.com/\n10http://discodiffusion.com/\n11https://stablediffusionweb.com/\n12https://www.midjourney.com/\nTABLE I: The AIGC and major technology companies\nCompany\nProduct\nApplications\nOpenAI\nChatGPT\nText generation, chatbots, and\ntext completion\nGoogle\nLaMDA\nQuestion answering and chatbots\nNVIDIA\nStyleGAN\nImage generation, art, and design\nMicrosoft\nTuring-NLG\nSummarization, translation, and\nquestion answering\nDeepMind\nDVD-GAN\nVideo generation\nStability.AI\nStable Diffusion\nText to images\nEleutherAI\nGPT-Neo\nText generation\nBaidu\nERNIE\nQuestion answering and chatbots\nTo provide more insights and ideas for related scholars\nand researchers, this survey focuses on the issues related to\nAIGC and summarizes the emerging concepts in this \ufb01eld.\nFurthermore, we discuss the potential challenges and problems\nthat the future AIGC may meet, such as the lack of global\nconsensus on ethical standards, and the potential risks of AI\nmisuse and abuse.

What is AI-generated content?\nAI-generated content refers to writing pieces such as blogs,\nmarketing materials, articles, and product descriptions that\nare created by machines. As shown in Fig. 3, AIGC has\nexperienced three different modes of content generation. In the\nPGC mode, content is generated by professional teams [7], [8].\nThe advantage of PGC is that most of the generated content\nis high quality, but the production cycle is long and dif\ufb01cult\nto meet the quantity demand for output. In the UGC mode,\n3\n \n Introduction (Section I)\n Related Concepts (Section II)\n What is AI-generated content?\n Necessary conditions of AIGC\n How can AI make the content better?\n The industrial chain of AIGC\n Advantages of Large-scale Pre-trained Models\n Generation of smart text\n Pros of AIGC\n Cons of AIGC\n AIGC and Metaverse\n Challenges and Promising Directions (Section III)\n Challenges\n Promising directions\n Conclusion (Section IV)\nFig. 2: The outline of this survey.\nusers can select many authoring tools to complete content\ngeneration by themselves [9], [10]. The advantage of UGC is\nthat using these creative tools can reduce the threshold and cost\nof creation and improve the enthusiasm of users to participate\nin the creation. The disadvantage of UGC is that the quality\nof output content is dif\ufb01cult to ensure because the level of\ncreators is uneven. AIGC can overcome the shortcomings of\nPGC and UGC in terms of quantity and quality. It is expected\nto become the primary mode of content generation in the\nfuture. In the AIGC mode, AI technology uses professional\nknowledge to improve the quality of content generation, which\nalso saves time.\nPGC\nUGC\nAIGC\nProduction \nEfficiency\nContent \nproduction \nmode\nProfessional teams\nUser \n+\nCreative platform\nAI\n+\nUser/Professional Teams \n+\nCreative platform\nFig. 3: Three different modes of content production.\nSome entrepreneurs are planning to use AIGC products\nto automatically \ufb01nish advertisement production tasks, which\nwas costly and time-consuming before. In general, AIGC can\nbe categorized into text, picture, and video generation.\nText generation. AIGC encompasses structured writing,\ncreative writing, and dialogue writing as its main sub\ufb01elds\n[11], [12], [13]. Structured writing primarily generates text\ncontent based on structured data for speci\ufb01c scenarios, such as\nnews. However, creative writing involves generating text with\na higher degree of openness, which demands personalization\nand creative capability. Creative writing is well-suited for\nmarketing copy, social media, and blogs. Dialogue writing\nis mainly used for chatbots that interact with users through\ntext. These bots are designed to answer questions, much like\ncustomer services.\nPictures\ngeneration. By leveraging AIGC, users can\nchange and add new elements to their pictures based on the\nprompts given [14], [15], [16]. It makes it easier and more\nef\ufb01cient to edit images without the need for advanced skills\nor knowledge. Additionally, AIGC can independently generate\nimages to meet speci\ufb01c requirements. For example, if a user\nneeds a poster or logo in a speci\ufb01c format, AIGC can generate\nit in a short time. Another exciting application of AIGC is the\ncreation of 3D models from 2D images [17].\nAudio generation. AIGC\u2019s audio generation technology can\nbe divided into two categories. That is text-to-speech synthesis\nand voice cloning, respectively. Text-to-speech synthesis needs\ninput text and outputs the speech of a speci\ufb01c speaker. It is\nmainly used for robots and voice broadcasting tasks. Until\nnow, text-to-speech tasks have been relatively mature. The\nquality of speech has met the natural standard. In the future,\nit will develop toward more emotional speech synthesis and\nsmall-sample speech learning. Voice cloning takes a given\ntarget speech as input, and then converts the input speech or\ntext into the target speaker\u2019s speech. This type of task is used\nin intelligent dubbing and other similar scenarios to synthesize\nspeech from a speci\ufb01c speaker.\nVideo generation. AIGC has been utilized in video clip\nprocessing to generate trailers and promotional videos [18],\n[19]. The work\ufb02ow is similar to image generation, where each\nframe of the video is processed at the frame level, and then AI\nalgorithms are utilized to detect video clips. AIGC\u2019s ability to\ngenerate engaging and highly effective promotional videos is\nenabled by the combination of different AI algorithms. With its\nadvanced capabilities and growing popularity, AIGC is likely\nto continue to revolutionize the way video content is created\nand marketed.\nB. Necessary conditions of AIGC\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4, AIGC consists of three critical\ncomponents: data, hardware, and algorithms. High-quality\ndata, such as audio, text, and images, serve as the fundamental\nbuilding blocks for training algorithms. The data volume and\ndata sources have a vital impact on the accuracy of predic-\ntions [20]. Hardware, particularly computing power, forms\nthe infrastructure of AIGC. With the growing demand for\ncomputing power, faster and more powerful chips, as well\nas cloud computing solutions, have become essential. The\nhardware should be capable of processing terabytes of data\nand algorithms with millions of parameters. The combination\nof accelerating chips and cloud computing plays a vital role\nin providing the computing power required to ef\ufb01ciently run\nlarge models [21]. Ultimately, the performance of algorithms\ndetermines the quality of content generation, and the support\nof data and hardware is crucial in achieving optimal results.\nData. The functionality of ChatGPT demonstrates that data\nis the foundation and basis for cloud computing and intelli-\n4\nCognitive Interactivity\nAIGC\nData\nAlgorithm\nHardware\nLarge-scale data \ncorpus\nHigh-precision \ntraining set\nAnnotation\nTraining\nData learning\nNew data \ngeneration\nLocal \ncomputing\nCloud \ncomputing\nEdge \ncomputing\nFig. 4: Relations between hardware, algorithms, and data.\ngent AI business iterations. The accuracy of training models\ndepends on the size of the training datasets. The larger sample\ndatasets often result in more accurate models. Typically, train-\ning tasks require billions to hundreds of billions of \ufb01les. There-\nfore, storing and managing these massive datasets is crucial.\nTo solve these issues, many cloud computing and data storage\nservices, such as Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob storage,\nand Google Cloud Storage, have been booming. Cloud storage\nservices strongly offer storage solutions that are scalable, fast,\nsecure, easy to process, and acceptable for massive data.\nAdditionally, organizing and managing humorous datasets puts\nforward higher-level special techniques, such as data cleaning,\nduplicate data elimination, labeling, and categorization. All the\nabove demands aim to make data well-organized and easier\nto process, thereby better supporting large-scale training and\nintelligent AI business applications.\nHardware. While massive data provides vital support for\nbig data and AI applications, new storage demands are also\nurgent. The implementation of large models is heavily re-\nliant on large computing power. Companies must consider\nthe challenges of computing cost and algorithms\u2019 ef\ufb01ciency\n[22]. Take ChatGPT as an example. ChatGPT can be di-\nvided into numerous AI models that require speci\ufb01c AI chips\n(e.g., GPU, FPGA, and ASIC) to handle complex computing\ntasks. According to OpenAI\u2019s report in 2020 [23], the total\ncomputational power required to train the GPT-3 XL model\nwith 1.3 billion parameters is approximately 27.5 PFlop/s-day.\nSince ChatGPT is based on the \ufb01ne-tuning of the GPT-3.5\nmodel, which has a parameter quantity similar to the GPT-3\nXL model. In other words, ChatGPT will take 27.5 days to\ncomplete the training at a speed of 1 trillion times per second.\nChatGPT runs more than 30,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs to meet\n13 million independent visitors per day in January 2023. The\ninitial investment cost for these chips was approximate $800\nmillion, and the daily electricity charge is around $50,000.\nAlgorithm. With the help of current intelligent data mining\nalgorithms (e.g., neural networks [24], [25] and deep learning\n[26], [27]), the potential rules inherent in data can be learned\nindependently by iteratively optimizing parameters within the\nlearning paradigm and network structure. Moreover, with\nthe development of the large-scale pre-training model, AI\ncan combine the information from data mining to generate\nhigh-quality content. Large pre-training models are arti\ufb01cial\nintelligence models that use a large amount of text data\nfor pre-training, such as BERT, GPT, etc. Large pre-training\nmodels are an important part of AI-generated content, and their\nimprovement and development help to continuously improve\nthe quality and accuracy of generated content.\nActually, as shown in Fig. 5, the current high-performance\nAI algorithm has gone through a long way of exploration.\nThey gradually integrate the human thinking mode to improve\nthe algorithm\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency. In traditional machine learning\nalgorithms, data are classi\ufb01ed by functions or parameters. The\nalgorithms simulate the simple human brain, which improves\nthe learning model through experience accumulation [28].\nNeural network models further emulate the signal processing\nand thinking mechanisms of human brain nerves [29], [30].\nFurthermore, generative algorithms, such as Google\u2019s Trans-\nformer architecture [31], draw on human attention mechanisms\nto enable the completion of multiple tasks by an algorithm.\nMeachine Learning\nNeural Network Model\nLarge-scale Pre-trained Model\nThey can accumulate \nexperience through trial \nand error and reflection.\nThey can simulate the \nsignal processing and \nthinking mechanisms \nof human brain nerves.\nLanguage Model\nGenerative Algorithm\nThey can complete various \nnatural language tasks and\nunderstand the complexity of \nhuman language.\nThey can  model the \nprobability distribution \nof the input data and \nthen generate new data.\nThey are trained by processing large amounts \nof text data, then fine-tuned on specific tasks \nwith labeled data, enabling them to interact \naccording to contextual content and chat in a \nmanner similar to human beings.\nFig. 5: The evolution of AI models.\nGoodfellow proposed the \ufb01rst generative model, Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN), in 2014 [5]. Table II shows the\nevolution timeline of generative algorithms. In most cases,\nthe signi\ufb01cance of GAN is a source of inspiration for many\npopular variations and architectures. The transformer model\nhas a wide range of applications in various domains (including\nNLP and CV). In addition, several pre-training models, such as\nBERT, GPT-3, and LaMDA, have been developed based on the\nTransformer model. The diffusion model is currently the most\nadvanced image generation model because of its optimized\nperformance.\nWith the development of generative models, language mod-\nels have also made great progress. For example, Devlin et al.\n[32] proposed the BERT model to complete various natural\nlanguage understanding tasks. BERT has revolutionary signif-\nicance in understanding the complexity of human language.\nFurthermore, in recent years, there has been a rise in the\npopularity of large-scale pre-training models, which boast im-\npressive generalization performance. Large-scale pre-training\nmodels can effectively address the challenges of frequent pa-\nrameter modi\ufb01cation. These models interact in a contextually-\nrelevant manner and exhibit behavior similar to that of human\nbeings when chatting and communicating because they are\ntrained by connecting large-scale real corpora.\nC. How can AI make the content better?\nAIGC owns three cutting-edge capabilities: digital twins,\nintelligent editing, and intelligent creation (Fig. 6). These\n5\nTABLE II: The evolution timeline of generative algorithms.\nAlgorithm\nYear\nDescription\nVAE [33]\n2014\nEncoder-Decoder models obtained based on variational lower bounds constraints.\nGAN [5]\n2014\nGenerator-Discriminator models based on adversarial learning.\nFlow-based models\n[34]\n2015\nLearning a non-linear bijective transformation that maps training data to another space, where the distribution\ncan be factorized. The entire model architecture relies on directly maximizing log likelihood to achieve this.\nThe diffusion model has two processes, namely the forward diffusion process and the reverse diffusion process.\nDuring the forward diffusion phase, noise is gradually added to the image until it is completely corrupted into\nGaussian noise. Then, during the reverse phase, the model learns the process of restoring the original image\nfrom Gaussian noise. After training, the model can use these denoising techniques to synthesize new \u201cclean\u201d\ndata from random inputs.\nDiffusion [35]\n2015\nThe diffusion model has two processes. In the forward diffusion stage, noise is gradually applied to the image\nuntil the image is destroyed by complete Gaussian noise, and then in the reverse diffusion stage, the process of\nrestoring the original image from Gaussian noise is learned.

The main body includes the Encoder and Decoder parts, which are\nresponsible for encoding the source language text and converting the encoding information into the target\nlanguage text, respectively.\nNerf [36]\n2020\nIt proposes a method to optimize the representation of a continuous 5D neural radiance \ufb01eld (volume density\nand view-dependent color at any continuous location) from a set of input images. The problem to be solved is\nhow to generate images from new viewpoints, given a set of captured images.\nCLIP [37]\n2021\nFirstly, perform natural language understanding and computer vision analysis. Second, train the model with\npre-labeled \u201dtext-image\u201d training data. On the one hand, train the model on the text. From another aspect, train\nanother model and continuously adjust the internal parameters of the two models so that the text and image\nfeature values output by the models respectively match and con\ufb01rm.\ncapabilities are nested and combined with each other to give\nAIGC superior generation capability.\nDigital twins. AIGC can be used to map real-world content\ninto the virtual world, such as intelligent translation and\nenhancement [38], [39], [40]. Intelligent translation involves\ntransforming content across different modalities, e.g., lan-\nguage, audio, and visual, based on an understanding of the\nunderlying meaning. This enables effective communication\nbetween people who speak different languages. Intelligent\nenhancement involves improving the quality and completeness\nof digitized content by \ufb01lling in missing information, enhanc-\ning the image and audio quality, and removing noise and\ndistortions. It is particularly effective when dealing with old\nor damaged content that may be incomplete or poor quality.\nIntelligent editing. AIGC enables interaction between vir-\ntual and reality through intelligent semantic understanding\nand attribute control [41], [42], [43]. Intelligent semantic\nunderstanding enables the separation and decoupling of digital\ncontent based on understanding. The attribute control enables\nprecise modi\ufb01cation and attribute editing based on understand-\ning. The generated content can then be output into the real\nworld, resulting in a closed loop of twinning and feedback.\nIntelligent creation. AIGC is a term used to describe\nthe content generated by AI [44], [45], [46]. AIGC can be\ncategorized into two types: imitation-based creation and con-\nceptual creation. Imitation-based creation involves learning the\npatterns and data distribution features from existing examples.\nIt creates new content based on previously learned patterns.\nLearning abstract concepts from massive data and applying\nstudied knowledge to create new content that did not exist\nbefore is what conceptual creation entails.\nAIGC technology has become an increasingly popular tool\nfor generating content in various industries. ChatGPT is an ap-\npropriate illustration of AIGC. Advanced reinforcement learn-\ning techniques and expert human supervision enable ChatGPT\nDigital \ntwins\nIntelligent \ncreation\nIntelligent \nediting\nIntelligent \ntranslation\nIntelligent \nenhancement\nIntelligent \nsemantic \nunderstanding\nAttribute \ncontrol\nImitation-\nbased creation\nConceptual \ncreation\nThe generation \ncapability  of  AIGC\nFig. 6: Three cutting-edge capabilities of AIGC.\nto acquire effective understanding and well-processed natural\nlanguage. It was demonstrated to have a high degree of\ncoherence in understanding the context. As shown in Fig. 7,\nChatGPT has six key features that make it a powerful tool in\nnatural language processing. In terms of making conversations,\nChatGPT can actively recall prior conversations to aid in\nanswering hypothetical questions. Moreover, ChatGPT \ufb01lters\nout sensitive information and provides recommendations for\nunanswered queries, which improves its usage performance.\nChatGPT is an ideal tool for customer service, language\ntranslation, content creation, and other applications due to its\nadvanced features.\nD. The industrial chain of AIGC\nThe AIGC industry chain is an interconnected ecosystem\nthat spans from upstream to downstream. As shown in Fig.\n8, downstream applications are heavily reliant on the basic\nsupport of upstream productions. Data suppliers, algorithmic\ninstitutions, and hardware development institutions are major\nparts of upstream AIGC. Data suppliers utilize web crawling\ntechnology to collect vast amounts of text from news websites,\nblogs, and social media [47]. Then, these wild data have to\nbe automatically labeled or processed by NLP technologies\n6\nUnderstand\ncontext\nImprove accuracy\nCapture user intention\nGenerate continuous \ndialogue\nDare to question\nAdmit not knowing\nFig. 7: The six features of AIGC.\n[48]. Algorithmic institutions typically consist of a group of\nexperienced computer scientists and mathematicians with deep\ntheoretical backgrounds and practical experience. They can\ndevelop ef\ufb01cient and accurate algorithms to solve various\ncomplex problems. Hardware development institutions focus\non developing dedicated chips, processors, accelerator cards,\nand other hardware devices to accelerate the computing speed\nand response capabilities of AI algorithms.\nThe midstream sector includes big technology companies\nthat integrate upstream data, hardware, and algorithms. These\ncompanies leverage these resources to deploy algorithms\nthat set up computing resources and con\ufb01gure corresponding\nparameters in cloud computing, such as virtual machines,\ncontainers, databases, and storage. According to the speci\ufb01c\nproperties and requirements of the algorithm, they ensure the\noptimal performance and ef\ufb01ciency of the algorithm through\nreasonable con\ufb01guration. Then, the performance-optimized\nalgorithm is encapsulated to generate a tool with an external\ninterface. They are the bridge between upstream and down-\nstream, connecting data suppliers and algorithmic institutions\nwith content creation platforms and end-users. These com-\npanies earn revenue through personalized marketing, such as\nadvertising placement and virtual brand building. In addition,\nmidstream companies also play a critical role in advancing AI\ntechnologies. They invest in most research and development,\nwhich continuously enhances the performance and ef\ufb01ciency\nof AI systems. They also provide training data and feedback to\nupstream data suppliers and algorithmic institutions. The mid-\nstream companies contribute to the continuous improvement\nof the entire AIGC industry chain.\nThe downstream segment mainly consists of various content\ncreation platforms. It lowers users\u2019 learning costs for creating\ncontent. Users can ef\ufb01ciently complete tasks with the help\nof midstream tools. For example, news media and \ufb01nancial\ninstitutions can quickly generate reports using text-generation\ntools. Since they are the primary recipients of the value that\nthese technologies generate, downstream users are crucial in\npromoting the adoption and commercialization of AI tech-\nnologies. By utilizing AI-powered tools and their services,\ndownstream users can improve their productivity, enhance\ntheir decision-making, and create new opportunities for growth\nand innovation in their respective industries.\nData supplier\nResearch organization of algorithm\nOpen source algorithm\nComputer hardware\nCloud computing\nAutomatic real-time \ninteraction\nUpstream\nMidstream\nDownstream\nMany large technology companies\nContent design\nOperational efficiency \nimprovement\nPersonalized \nmarketing\nBuild tool\nContent creation \nplatform\nContent terminal \nmanufacturer\nThird-party \ncontent service \nprovider\nAIGC content \ndetection\nData splitting and annotation\nFig. 8: The industrial chain of AIGC.\nE. Advantages of large-scale pre-trained models\nThe large-scale AI model is a signi\ufb01cant milestone in the\ndevelopment of AI towards general intelligence [49]. The\nuse of large-scale models is a clear indication of greater\ngeneralization for AIGC. Despite the challenges posed by\nthe proliferation of general-purpose data and the lack of\nreliable data, deep learning entirely depends on models to\nautomatically learn from data, and thus signi\ufb01cantly improves\nperformance [50], [51]. Large-scale models possess both large-\nscale and pre-training characteristics and require pre-training\non massive generalized data before modeling for practical\ntasks [52]. These models are known as large-scale pre-trained\nmodels [53]. In fact, AI\u2019s large-scale models can be seen as\nan emulation of the human brain, which is the source of\nAI\u2019s inspiration [54]. In fact, the human brain is a large-\nscale model with basic cognitive abilities [55]. The human\nbrain can ef\ufb01ciently process information from different senses\nand perform different cognitive tasks simultaneously. Thus, the\nAI large-scale model is not only expected to have numerous\nparticipants but also be able to effectively understand multi-\nmodal information, perceive across modalities, and migrate or\nexecute between different tasks simultaneously. The improved\naccuracy of AI large-scale models in understanding human\nthinking is attributed to systems based on human feedback\ndata for model training [56].\nAs illustrated in Fig. 9, the process of developing large-scale\npre-trained models can be divided into three main steps. The\n\ufb01rst step is gathering explanatory data to train a supervised\nlearning strategy. The second step involves collecting compar-\native data to train a reward model, which allows the model to\nmake more accurate predictions. The \ufb01nal step is to collect\nexplanatory data to optimize the model using augmented\nlearning techniques. This will enhance the performance and\nef\ufb01ciency of the model.\nHence, the use of large-scale pre-training models can im-\nprove the performance and generalization of AI. Speci\ufb01cally,\nlarge-scale pre-trained models have the following advantages\nfor AI as well as AIGC:\n\u2022 Better generalization ability. By pre-training on large-\nscale data, the model can learn more features and patterns,\nimproving its generalization ability and allowing it to\nadapt to different tasks and scenarios.\n\u2022 Save training cost.

The pre-\ntrained models can be used for multiple tasks.\n\u2022 Improve training ef\ufb01ciency. Pre-trained models are \ufb01ne-\ntuned in a \ufb01ne-tuned way. Therefore, training can be done\nfaster, and the results obtained can be better on smaller\ndatasets.\n\u2022 Support multiple tasks. The pre-trained model can\nbe used for multiple tasks, such as natural language\nprocessing, computer vision, and speech recognition. Due\nto \ufb01ne-tuning training, these tasks greatly improve the\napplicability of the model.\n\u2022 Continuous optimization. The pre-trained model can be\ncontinuously optimized to expand the model\u2019s capability\nand make it more intelligent and adaptable by continu-\nously adding new data and tasks.\nF. Generation of smart text\nAs previously mentioned, AIGC technology is unable to\nproduce original content if you request speci\ufb01c needs and\ninterests. Nevertheless, they can still play a useful role in the\ncontent creation process as writing assistants. We believe that\nthere is a signi\ufb01cant distinction between AI-assisted writing\nand AI-generated writing.\nAI-assisted writing (AIAW). The goal of AIAW is to\nprovide assistance for human writing, which improves the\ncoherence of the user\u2019s writing experience. This kind of\nwriting tool can signi\ufb01cantly improve the ef\ufb01ciency of writing\nin speci\ufb01c \ufb01elds, such as legal documents. In fact, assisted\nwriting can offer help in different stages of writing, like\ncon\ufb01rming the theme, writing content, and publishing the\narticle. Before writing, the topic should be established \ufb01rst.\nThe algorithm can recommend suitable text materials by\nanalyzing current topics [57]. This saves searching and sorting\ntime. During the writing process, the algorithm can provide\nwriting inspiration assistance [58]. Through learning numerous\nsimilar articles, the AI model infers the subsequent parts\nof un\ufb01nished sentences from the perspective of statistical\nprobability. AIGC can provide real-time error detection and\ncorrection suggestions for writing articles [59] by collecting\nmisspellings and incorrect word combinations from the corpus.\nThen, the algorithm provides comments on modi\ufb01cations to\nhelp authors improve their writing results. Before publishing,\nAIGC will add appropriate titles and labels about writing\ncontent.\nAI-generated writing (AIGW). AIGW technology enables\nmachines to write articles independently. Currently, computers\nare capable of automatically generating news alerts, hot press\nreleases, and poetry articles. Intelligent writing algorithms can\ndescribe the main information contained in structured data.\nDue to the speed of machine processing, which is far faster\nthan that of humans, AIGC works better in terms of generating\ntime-sensitive news. For hot-draft writing, AIGC is useful in\nmining associated and related information [60]. AIGC can\nselect appropriate content based on massive materials and\nextract relevant information through content analysis, ulti-\nmately organizing the results based on the writing logic [60].\nMoreover, AIGC produces creative results that meet speci\ufb01c\nformat requirements, including intelligent poetry writing and\nintelligent couplets [61]. Because the model\u2019s output cannot\nbe predicted in advance, AIGC has similar creativity to human\nwriting. For example, if we want to use AIGC to write ancient\npoetry, we should input suf\ufb01cient training data of poetry to\ntrain the model.\nAIAW vs. AIGW. The major differences between AIAW\nand AIGW are listed in Fig. 10. Human beings have irre-\nplaceable advantages in the \ufb01eld of writing. Deep learning\nmodels can easily create high-quality texts, but they cannot\nreplace the subjective role of humans in writing practice.\nAI is superior to a human in data collection, but it cannot\nreally create innovative, compassionate, and humorous texts.\nIn addition, human writers have profound analytical abilities.\nGood writers not only have literary talent but also know how\nto effectively use words to express their thoughts. Human\nwriters can purposefully decompose complex topics into easy-\nto-understand languages and provide valuable information for\nreaders. Therefore, since AI tools are a valuable resource\nin content creation, it is important to balance usage, human\ncreativity, and expression in writing. A reasonable division of\nlabor between humans and machines is essential for achieving\noptimal results. In the future, AI should focus on data col-\n8\nTABLE III: Several main pros of AIGC\nPros\nDescription\nEf\ufb01ciency and scalability\nAIGC can provide many bene\ufb01ts over traditional human writing, including speed and language localization.

Pros of AIGC\nThere are some pros to AIGC as shown in Table III. AI-\ngenerated content is becoming increasingly popular due to\nits strong abilities. AIGC is ef\ufb01cient, cost-effective, and even\nfrees up human resources for other tasks. In this section, we\nwill discuss some major bene\ufb01ts of AIGC.\nEf\ufb01ciency and scalability. AIGC can provide many ben-\ne\ufb01ts over traditional human writing, including speed and\nlanguage localization [62]. An AIGC production can produce\nan article in minutes, whereas a human writer will take a much\nlonger time to \ufb01nish it. This advantage allows AI tools to\nproduce massive content in a short time. Additionally, AIGC\ncan function in language localization according to translate\ncontent into a common language, which will be tailored to\ncertain geographic areas. Another bene\ufb01t of AIGC is its\npersonalized social media creation ability. It is very useful\nfor various websites. By analyzing users\u2019 online data, AI can\ncreate individual content for different users.\nHelp scienti\ufb01c research. AIGC can have a signi\ufb01cant\nimpact on scienti\ufb01c research in multiple ways [63]. Firstly,\nAI can assist in analyzing large datasets through machine\nlearning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations that\nmight not be easily visible to human researchers. Secondly,\nAI can analyze existing scienti\ufb01c literature and generate\nhypotheses that can be tested in further research, which can\nhelp identify new avenues for research. Additionally, scientists\ncan use AI\u2019s learning ability in speci\ufb01c \ufb01elds to get some\nresearch that bene\ufb01ts mankind. For example, AI can help in\nthe development of new drugs and treatments by predicting\nthe interactions between molecules and proteins. Overall, the\nuse of AI-generated content can lead to more accurate and\nef\ufb01cient research outcomes, saving time and resources in the\nprocess.\nFor search engine optimization. AI improves search en-\ngine optimization (SEO) in several ways [64]. Due to the abil-\nity to provide data-driven insights and automate the work\ufb02ow\nof AI, website owners are able to focus on creating high-\nquality content and providing better services. For example, AI-\npowered tools can analyze search queries and suggest relevant\nkeywords to users. These tools make identifying patterns and\ntrends easier by identifying keywords. AI tools optimize the\nlength, structure, and readability of content, as well as suggest\nrelevant keywords, to make websites more SEO-friendly.\nOvercome writer\u2019s block. AI may be a helpful tool for\nwriters solving writer\u2019s block according to inspiration, as-\nsistance, and polishing [65]. For instance, AI tools generate\nsuggestions based on inputting keywords or topics. The tools\nanalyze search data, trending topics, and popular queries to\ncreate fresh content. What\u2019s more, AIGC assists in writing\narticles and posting blogs on speci\ufb01c topics. While these tools\nmay not be able to produce high-quality content by themselves,\nthey can provide a starting point for a writer struggling with\nwriter\u2019s block.\nH. Cons of AIGC\nOne of the main concerns among the public is the potential\nlack of creativity and human touch in AIGC. In addition,\nAIGC sometimes lacks a nuanced understanding of language\nand context, which may lead to inaccuracies and misinterpre-\ntations. There are also concerns about the ethics and legality\nof using AIGC, particularly when it results in issues such as\ncopyright infringement and data privacy. In this section, we\nwill discuss some of the disadvantages of AIGC (Table IV).\nEthics and trust. AI relies on data and algorithms to\ngenerate content, which may result in a lack of intended tone\nand personality [66]. While AI tools can effectively cover the\nblack-and-white areas of a topic, they may struggle with the\nmore subjective gray areas. Additionally, plagiarized events\nwill occur frequently, since AI tools often pull information\nfrom the same sources and reword it. To ensure authoritative\nand informative content, proper human review and curation\nare needed, especially if the information is pulled from various\nsources. The content can be crafted to maintain the intended\ntone, \ufb02ow, and context by adding a human touch, thus im-\nproving the user experience.\nExacerbate social imbalances. AIGC has the potential to\nexacerbate social imbalances. As a result, those who have\naccess to and can afford advanced AI tools and technologies\nmay have an unfair advantage over those who do not or cannot\nafford them. Some people can use AI tools to complete the\noriginal tasks at multiple speeds, while those who do not\n9\nTABLE IV: Some major cons of AIGC\nCons\nDescription\nEthics and trust\nDue to the lack of intended tone and personality, the generated answers may be \ufb01ltered out.\nExacerbate social imbalances\nSome people can use AI tools to complete the original tasks at various speeds, whereas others may need to spend a\nsigni\ufb01cant amount of time thinking and creating content.\nNegative effects on education\nAIGC may lack the human touch and personalization that are necessary for effective learning.\nInadequate empathy\nFor instance, AI-generated music might not have the same emotional depth and authenticity as music performed and\ncomposed by humans.\nHuman involved\nPeople still need to be involved and articles quality-checked.\nMissing creativeness\nIt is hard for AIGC to come up with new content with the latest, trending ideas and topics.\nuse AI tools may need to spend a lot of time thinking and\ncreating content. This could lead to a situation where a small\ngroup of people dominates the production of content, creating\na concentration of power and in\ufb02uence that can exacerbate\nexisting inequalities.\nNegative effects on education. There are some potential\nnegative effects of relying solely on AI-generated content for\neducation [67]. AIGC, for example, may lack the human touch\nand personalization required for effective learning. The use\nof AIGC can create a dependency on technology and dis-\ncourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Students\nmay become too reliant on the information provided by AI-\ngenerated content and fail to develop their own analytical\nskills. Additionally, AIGC may transfer the basic knowledge to\nusers if the underlying data used to train the AI algorithms is\nbiased or \ufb02awed. It may cause students to form a permanently\nwrong knowledge system.\nInadequate empathy. While AI-generated content can be\nef\ufb01cient and cost-effective, it may lack the creativity, emotion,\nand nuance that humans can bring to their creations. In the AI\ntool\u2019s work, it just generates content based on the parameters\nand objectives by analyzing large amounts of data and patterns,\nbut it cannot truly comprehend the underlying meaning or\ncontext of the content. For example, compared to the music\ngenerated by composers and performers, AI-generated music\nmay lack emotional depth and authenticity.\nHuman involved. While AIGC can certainly save time\nand effort in most cases, it is important to note that human\ninvolvement is still crucial in ensuring the quality and accuracy\nof the content [68]. AI tools have the ability to aggregate infor-\nmation from multiple sources, but they may lack the nuanced\nunderstanding of language that humans possess. Because of\nthis, the output can have mistakes and inconsistencies that\nneed to be \ufb01xed by a person. For example, AIGC product\ndescriptions may mix up textures and colors because of the\ntool\u2019s limited understanding of adjective meanings.\nMissing creativity. AI tools rely heavily on existing data\nto generate content, which can limit their ability to create\nfresh and original ideas [69]. While they assist in streamlining\ncontent creation and generating ideas, they do not have the\nability to generate completely new concepts on their own. This\nmeans that AIGC may not always be innovative or up-to-date\nwith the latest trends. In other words, it may cause missing\ncreativity. They may be able to analyze rich data to understand\nwhat types of content are popular or engaging, but they may\nnot fully understand the nuances of a particular audience or\nbe able to create content that truly resonates with them.\nI. AIGC and Metaverse\nThe Metaverse [70], [71] builds a persistent multi-user envi-\nronment that combines physical reality with digital virtuality.\nIt is a multi-user virtual space that allows multiple users\nto express their individual creativity. People communicate\nand interact with others through digital objects in a virtual\nenvironment [70]. AIGC, in our opinion, can round out the\nMetaverse\u2019s personalized services and make it more vivid and\nvital.\nAIGC enables ef\ufb01cient content creation, meets increasing\ndemands for interaction, and improves personalized experi-\nences [72]. It can simulate the virtual human brain to gen-\nerate content for the Metaverse, including intelligent NPCs,\nautomated QA, dialogue systems, and digital humans [73].\nThe Metaverse\u2019s concentration on cutting-edge technologies\nand users\u2019 interaction data accumulation can further enhance\nAIGC\u2019s intelligence and content creation abilities. By launch-\ning standardized and low-code development tools, AIGC en-\nables small and medium-sized studios and individual develop-\ners to produce richer interactive content in the Metaverse.\nIn the Metaverse, the immense amount of data is the basis\nof maintaining smooth execution. With the help of AIGC\ntechnology, AI replaces humans to solve the Metaverse\u2019s\nneeds in terms of massive data. Synthetic data based on\nAIGC technology has seen signi\ufb01cant development in the\nInternet domain [74]. AIGC data can be particularly useful in\ncreating various scenarios within the Metaverse. For instance,\nconsidering an example of constructing a school online, a\nvast amount of environmental data is required to ensure a\nhighly simulated scenario. Such work volume is a tedious and\nexpensive process, which involves signi\ufb01cant labor costs and\nresource utilization. However, AIGC can assist in generating\nthe required environmental data, thereby saving a lot of time\nand money. By leveraging this process, AIGC contributes to\nthe Metaverse data generation, which promotes the develop-\nment of related technology in turn.\nIII. CHALLENGES\nA. Data\nData is one of the keys to ensuring the accuracy of training\nalgorithms. In order to make output results more effective, the\ntraining datasets should ensure data quality and fairness [75].\nIf the data contains deviations and inaccuracies in information,\nit may lead to biased and inaccurate responses, especially in\nterms of sensitive topics such as race, gender, and politics. To\naddress this issue, synthetic data can be used in training. In the\npast, using real-world data to train AI models posed various\n10\nproblems, such as high costs for data collection and labeling,\ndif\ufb01culty in ensuring data quality and diversity, and challenges\nin protecting privacy. Synthetic data can effectively solve these\nissues by serving as a cost-effective substitute for real-world\ndata in training, testing, and validating AI models [76], [77].\nUsing synthetic data not only makes training AI models more\nef\ufb01cient but also enables AI models to self-learn and evolve\nin a virtual simulation world constructed from synthetic data.\nWhen training with data, it is important to adhere to legal\nand ethical standards. If data collected through web scraping is\nused in large-scale model training, it is important to ensure that\nthe data does not violate copyright or other legal regulations.\nIf it only uses the public dataset, it is usually not necessary\nto obtain the consent of the copyright owner, as these data\nare already considered part of the public domain. However,\nif copyrighted data is used, it is necessary to obtain the\npermission of the copyright owner or provide appropriate\ncompensation according to local legal regulations.\nB. Hardware\nThe large-scale pre-training model\u2019s hardware problems are\nmainly troubling in two aspects: insuf\ufb01cient computing power\nand high energy consumption. The insuf\ufb01cient computing\npower problem is due to the models becoming increasingly\ncomplex. The number of parameters and calculation complex-\nity are increasing exponentially, but hardware performance\nis not keeping up. In practice, high-performance computing\ndevices such as GPUs and TPUs are required for the training\nand inference of large-scale pre-training models. However,\neven with these dedicated chips, it is dif\ufb01cult to meet the\ntraining and inference needs of super-large-scale models. In\nthe paper published in 2020 [23], researchers from OpenAI\nreported that the pre-training of their language model GPT-3,\nwhich has 175 billion parameters, required 3.2 million core\nhours on a supercomputer with 2,048 CPUs and 2,048 GPUs.\nThe inference of GPT-3 required a cluster of 2,048 CPUs and\n2,048 GPUs, and the cost of running the model for a day was\nestimated to be around $4,000.\nThe high energy consumption issue mainly stems from\ntraining and inference. Firstly, for the training phase, a large\namount of computing resources are required to complete the\nmodel\u2019s training. This involves numerous matrix operations\nand neural network backpropagation. Secondly, for inference\nphase, due to the large number of parameters and complex\ncalculation processes in large-scale pre-training models, the\nenergy consumption of the inference phase is also high.\nOptimizing the calculation process and algorithm is a feasi-\nble approach to solving the above problems [78]. Utilizing\nef\ufb01cient computing devices and technologies (e.g., mixed-\nprecision computing and distributed training) also is another\npractical way [79].\nC. Algorithm\nOne of the most signi\ufb01cant advantages of large pre-trained\nlanguage models is their ability to perform information re-\ntrieval tasks. In the past, information retrieval tasks were\ncompleted using a search-\ufb01rst-then-read approach. Reviewing\nseveral relevant contextual documents from external corpora\nis the \ufb01rst step. Then, answers were predicted from these\ndocuments. Due to powerful memory and reasoning skills,\nlarge language models signi\ufb01cantly improve traditional steps\n[80]. Despite the signi\ufb01cant progress made by large language\nmodels in information retrieval tasks, there are still some\nlimitations that need to be addressed. For starters, a lack of\nvocabulary has an impact on retrieval accuracy and complete-\nness. Since these models may only understand the vocabulary\nin the training data, specialized terms or new vocabulary may\nnot be accurately comprehended. Second, contextual limita-\ntions cause the model to miss some implicit meanings and\neven cause some logical relationships to fail. To enhance the\ninformation retrieval capabilities of large language models, it\nis necessary to explore better language representation methods\n[81], [82].\nTo better meet user needs and handle complex tasks, the\nmodels should continuously improve and optimize themselves.\nThe use of user feedback is an important part of the optimiza-\ntion algorithm [83], [84]. Large pre-trained models can collect\nuser responses by engaging them in feedback loops and using\nthis feedback to optimize the model. This process typically\ninvolves presenting the model\u2019s prediction results to the user\nand requesting feedback. Feedback can be direct. For example,\nusers can choose an option to indicate whether the prediction\nresult is correct. Feedback can also be free-form. For instance,\nusers can write a text to describe their views on the prediction\nresult. Once enough feedback data is collected, the model\ncan analyze this feedback to determine how to adjust the\nmodel. This process typically uses natural language processing\ntechniques and machine learning algorithms to automatically\nanalyze and summarize user feedback and transform it into\ndata that can be used to optimize the model.\nWhen it comes to algorithms that generate content using\nAI, they are likely to be vulnerable to malicious attacks [85].\nThese attacks can take many forms, such as generating fake\ndata or tampering with the generated content. Attackers can\nmanipulate the model\u2019s input and output to deceive it and gen-\nerate misleading content, which can affect the model\u2019s results\nand performance. This can lead to serious consequences such\nas the spread of misleading information, social engineering\nattacks, and forgery of evidence, among others. To address\nthese attacks, it must improve the model\u2019s robustness and\nsecurity, employ adversarial training techniques and encryp-\ntion technologies, and increase user security awareness and\nvigilance [86].\nD. Privacy protection issues\nWhile training large pre-trained models, an unavoidable\nissue is how to rightly use sensitive personally identi\ufb01able\ninformation such as names, phone numbers, and addresses.\nDuring pre-training, this sensitive information may re\ufb02ect the\nmodel\u2019s weights and parameters, which could be leaked to at-\ntackers or unauthorized third parties. Additionally, these large\npre-trained models may also be used as the base models for\ntext classi\ufb01cation, sentiment analysis, and image recognition\ntasks, which further increases the risk of privacy breaches.\n11\nMoreover, distributed computing techniques are typically\nused to distribute the data across multiple computing nodes to\nrelieve operation pressure. During this process, if appropriate\nsecurity measures such as data encryption, access control,\nand data de-identi\ufb01cation are not taken, attackers may obtain\ndata by monitoring network traf\ufb01c and attacking computing\nnodes [87]. Therefore, a series of privacy protection measures\nneed to be taken to protect the sensitive data contained in\nlarge pre-trained models, including but not limited to data\nde-identi\ufb01cation, model security, restricting data access, and\naccountability. At the same time, corresponding security mea-\nsures such as data encryption, access control, and data de-\nidenti\ufb01cation should be taken to maximize privacy protection\nwhen using these models [88].\nE. NLP for General AIGC\nWith the continuous improvement of the capabilities of large\nlanguage models [89], natural language processing (NLP)\nfaces many challenges (Figure 11). In this era, we need a new\ngeneration of language models to further enhance the model\u2019s\ngeneration capabilities and then improve its descriptive ability\nand computability. Besides, carrying out a deep understanding\nof natural language (NLU) also needs the adoption of con-\nnectionist and symbolic approaches to solve various natural\nlanguage processing tasks [90]. On this basis, we need to\nensure the credibility of the output results of NLP models,\nwhile also considering issues such as security, values, ethics,\npolitics, privacy, and ethics.\nwith the physical,\nhuman systems, and\ninformation intelligent society\nAdoption of \nconnectionist and \nsymbolic approaches\nIncremental Learning, continuous \nlearning, and human-in-the-loop \ncapabilities\nComplex reasoning abilities \nand interpretability\nConsidering issues \nsuch as security, values,\nethics, politics, privacy, and ethics\nensure the credibility\nand verifiability of the output\nNLP  for \nGeneral  AIGC\nFig. 11: NLP for general AIGC.\nTo achieve these goals, it is essential to develop NLP\nmodels with complex reasoning abilities and interpretability.\nAddressing issues related to knowledge modeling, acquisition,\nand utilization can enhance the expressiveness and ef\ufb01ciency\nof these models. NLP models with incremental learning,\ncontinuous learning, and human-in-the-loop capabilities are\nalso should be considered, as well as the creation of smaller\nmodels, model editing, domain adaptation, domain-speci\ufb01c\nmodels, and models tailored to particular applications and\ntasks. Furthermore, it is crucial to prioritize human-well\nlearning and alignment to ensure the alignment of NLP\ntechnology with physical, human systems, and the intelligent\nsociety of information. By focusing on these aspects, we can\nmake signi\ufb01cant progress in advancing the \ufb01eld of NLP and\nensuring it bene\ufb01ts society as a whole. In the era of large\nlanguage models, the application of in-contextual learning\n(ICL) [91], [92] has emerged as a new paradigm in natural\nlanguage processing. By incorporating ICL into large language\nmodels, these models show a better understanding of context\nand produce more accurate and relevant results. Therefore,\nit is crucial to consider the use of ICL in improving the\nperformance of NLP models.\nF. Human attitudes towards AIGC\nThere is a distinction to be made between AIGC and human-\ngenerated content, as illustrated in Fig. 12. Human-generated\ncontent is the product of human intelligence, experience,\ncreativity, and intuitive thinking. From another aspect, AIGC\nutilizes AI technology to train models to learn and simulate\nhumorous data, analyze problems, and behave like humans.\nAIGC\nHuman\nCreatation\nFig. 12: Human creation vs. AIGC.\nWhat aspects of AIGC need to be regulated by legisla-\ntion? The \ufb01rst one is the ownership of creating content. At\npresent, AIGC has taken the lead in media, e-commerce, \ufb01lm\nand television, entertainment, and other industries with high\ndigitalization degrees and rich content demand to achieve\nsigni\ufb01cant development, and its market potential is gradu-\nally emerging. Using AIGC to automatically generate videos,\nmusic, and even computer games to make pro\ufb01ts. Who does\nthe income belong to? Is it the users or AI? Governments\nneed to clarify protection rules about the intellectual property\nand data rights of AIGC which are based on the development\nand applications of AIGC technology. Since the commercial\napplication of AIGC will mature quickly and the market scale\nwill grow rapidly, the second aspect is that pursuing pro\ufb01t\nwill cause people to spread rumors and make forgery easier\nthan before. This urges governments to formulate appropriate\npolicies (including positive and negative requirements). The\npolicies should supervise programmers to take control and\nsafety measures to ensure safe and controllable AIGC ap-\nplications. More importantly, adopting content identi\ufb01cation,\ncontent traceability, and other technologies to ensure a reliable\nsource of AIGC is needed.\nWhat is the scope of AIGC\u2019s activities? The key advantage\nof AI systems over other software systems is their superior\nef\ufb01ciency. AI products have demonstrated the ability to per-\nform tasks that are beyond the capacity of humans, such\nas creating hundreds of unique images within an hour or\n12\nproducing billions of words in a single morning. However,\nthese capabilities have also raised concerns among many\npeople. As we are all aware, technology is a double-edged\nsword that can either enhance human life or have detrimental\nconsequences. Therefore, it is imperative to not only establish\nlaws but also consider the morality of users when designing\nAI products. Several unethical incidents have occurred due\nto the use of AIGC products, including cheating, plagiarism,\nand discrimination. As a result, it is necessary to promote\nthe ethical development of AI. Industry organizations can\naid this effort by creating ethical guidelines for trustworthy\nAIGC. Additionally, programmers developing AIGC applica-\ntions should follow the \u201cethics by design\u201d paradigm. Finally,\nthe ethics committee must establish a comprehensive and\nuniversal ethical review system.\nWhat is the relationship between humans and AI? We are\nvery much in the habit of seeing ourselves in the world around\nus. And while we are busy seeing ourselves by assigning\nhuman traits to things that are not, we risk being blindsided.\nAs the saying goes, \u201ca coin has two sides\u201d. The ChatGPT\nhas jolted some people out of secure jobs and made them\nfearful of losing their jobs. At the same time, it makes AI\nemployees see the dawn of AI. Since an AI-generated picture\nsurprisingly beat other contestants [93], some critics suppose\nAIGC will lower the creativity of humans. Until now, there has\nbeen a trade-off: you accept the disadvantages of AI products\nin order to get the bene\ufb01ts they bring. The powerful function\nof AIGC may make workers lazy and rest on their laurels.\nFurthermore, it will discourage enthusiasm among new blood\nin industries. However, we tend to regard different AIGC\napplications as strong assistants. The growth of AI-powered\ndata-driven technologies will bring more opportunities for\nmost people. The bloom of the car industry causes thousands\nof new jobs to be created, which is far more than that of raising\nhorses. AI will be a powerful ally for humans if we establish\na comprehensive AIGC governance system.\nG. Trusted AIGC\nLarge language models can provide detailed and informative\nresponses to various complex questions. However, surveys\nindicate that these models may generate inaccurate and biased\nanswers due to some reasons [94], [95]. For example, poor-\nquality data may be collected, and thus the model may not be\nable to differentiate the credibility of information sources or\neven assign a higher weight to unreliable information sources.\nMoreover, errors may also occur because of training. The\nmodel cannot determine whether the generated answer com-\nplies with ethical standards. Unfortunately, current algorithms\ncannot effectively solve the above issues. Humans checking\nthe \ufb01nal answers are still indispensable.\nRecently, ChatGPT was used to summarize a systematic\nreview of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy\n(CBT)13 on anxiety-related diseases published in JAMA Psy-\nchiatry. However, ChatGPT provided some responses that\ncontained factual errors, false statements, and false data. For\ninstance, ChatGPT erroneously stated that the review was\n13https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive behavioral therapy\nbased on 46 studies, where it was based on 69. In addition,\nit overstated the effectiveness of CBT, which could have seri-\nous consequences, such as misleading academic research and\naffecting medical diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, if Chat-\nGPT generates unethical responses, it could affect people\u2019s\nvalues and have a signi\ufb01cant negative impact on society, such\nas endangering social security when lawbreakers ask ChatGPT\nquestions about retaliation and terrorist attacks. Therefore,\n\ufb01ltering out harmful responses is essential in improving the\nalgorithms/models.\nIn the future, it is important to improve the transparency\nof large language models [96], [97]. Currently, the training\nsets and large language models used by these algorithms are\nnot publicly available. Technology companies may conceal\nthe internal operations of their dialogic AI and generate\nanswers that contradict reality. These practices run counter\nto the trend of transparency in open science. To address\nthese issues, we propose that scienti\ufb01c research institutions,\nincluding scienti\ufb01c funding organizations, universities, non-\ngovernmental organizations, government research institutions,\nthe United Nations, and technology companies should col-\nlaborate to develop advanced, open-source, transparent, and\ndemocratically controlled algorithm models. By doing so, we\ncan ensure that these models are trustworthy, reliable, and\naccountable to the public, while also promoting openness and\ntransparency in the AI domain.\nThe source code of open-source large models can be used\nfor free by anyone, which means that the organizations need\nto be responsible for the code, as the users of these models\nmay use them for various purposes, including commercial\nor malicious purposes. As contributors or maintainers, they\nshould ensure that the code is stable, reliable, and secure to\nprevent any negative impact from improper use. To ensure\nresponsibility for the code, the organizations should add an\nappropriate license that explicitly allows or prohibits certain\nuse cases. They should also stay closely connected with the\ncommunity to understand the usage of the code and promptly\naddress any potential issues. Finally, they should always be\nvigilant against potential abuse and malicious behavior and\ntake measures to prevent them.\nIV. PROMISING DIRECTIONS\nWith the rapid development of hardware and algorithms,\nthe future of AIGC is expected to see even more substantive\napplications. We believe that the most promising directions\nfor AIGC include cross-modal generation, search engine opti-\nmization, media production, e-commerce, \ufb01lm production, and\nother \ufb01elds, as illustrated in Fig. 13.\nA. Cross-modal generation technology\nThe information present in the real world is a complex\nsystem comprising text, audio, vision, sensors, and human\ntactile senses. To accurately simulate the real world, it is\nnecessary to utilize cross-modal generation capabilities. The\ndevelopment of large-scale pre-training models has enabled\nthe maturation of cross-modal generation. Text-to-images and\ntext-to-video are classic examples of cross-modal generation,\n13\nAIGC and \nvarious \nfields\nMedia\nFilm\nEducation\nIndustry\nMedical \ntreatment\nFinancial\nE-commerce\nFig. 13: The combinations of AIGC and other \ufb01elds.\nwhich involve generating visual content based on language.\nText to images [98], [99], like DALL-E from OpenAI, can\ncreate creative images based on textual descriptions, and\nsigni\ufb01cantly improves the ef\ufb01ciency of generating complex\npaintings. Previously, professional painters had to accumulate\nmaterials for years to build complex paintings, but now AI\npaintings can generate numerous complex paintings in a short\nperiod of time. Text-to-video has also yielded satisfactory\nexperimental results [100], [101]. Existing products for text-\nto-video, such as Lumen5 and CogView2, allow users to input\nimage and text information, such as articles, search queries,\nor PPTs, to generate videos. However, there is still room for\nimprovement in terms of video duration, clarity, and logic.\nIn future applications of cross-modal generation, there are\nseveral problems that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a\nusability issue, where users need to input long text descriptions\nto obtain high-quality content. This is time-consuming. Sec-\nondly, there is a controllability issue. Although text-to-images\ncan generate delicate images quickly, it may not generate\nimages that match speci\ufb01c user requirements. When the model\nover\ufb01ts, the image results may not meet expectations. For\nexample, after entering the style description, the model may\nproduce images that do not correspond to the expectations\nbecause the style model is over\ufb01tting to a speci\ufb01c scene.\nB. Search engine\nSearch engines are very suitable for \ufb01nding websites, but\nthey are often not enough to solve more complex problems\nor tasks. Every day, there are about 10 billion search queries\nin the world, but perhaps half of them do not get accurate\nanswers [102]. Now, combined with AIGC technology, it\nseems that this problem can be changed. With the support\nof OpenAI technology, Microsoft has updated the Bing search\nengine and Edge browser. The new version of Bing and Edge\nintegrates search, browsing, and chat into a uni\ufb01ed experience.\nThe search engine could provide better search service, more\ncomplete answers, a chat experience, and the ability to gen-\nerate content. Through cooperation with OpenAI, Microsoft\nhas added an advanced AI dialogue model to its search\nengine. Users can directly communicate with AI chat robots\nand ask questions in chat interfaces such as ChatGPT. The\nChatGPT model could provide fast, accurate, and powerful\nsearch capabilities so that it can get the most accurate and\nrelevant answers for basic search queries. In addition, Mi-\ncrosoft has also cooperated with OpenAI to implement special\nprotection measures against harmful content. The Microsoft\nteam is working hard to prevent the propagation of harmful\nor discriminatory content according to its own principles.\nC. Media\nAIGC is a game-changer in the media industry. It revolu-\ntionizes all aspects of news production, from news collection\nto manuscript writing, video editing, and news broadcast [103],\n[104]. Fig. 14 illustrates the impact of AIGC on the media\nindustry. By leveraging AIGC, media organizations can im-\nprove the ef\ufb01ciency and quality of their content generation and\nexpand their in\ufb02uence after publishing. In news collection, for\ninstance, AIGC can automatically sort and record voice data,\nwhich ensures timely news releases. In manuscript writing, the\nAIGC algorithms combined with structured text writing and\npress releases can expedite the process of content generation\nwhile enabling real-time error correction to enhance accuracy.\nIn video editing, AIGC can perform automatic editing, letter\ncon\ufb01guration, and video attribute repair. Automatic editing,\nfor example, can signi\ufb01cantly reduce manual labor by rapidly\ngenerating videos from materials. By leveraging cross-modal\ngeneration technology, AIGC can also produce subtitles in\nsync with the video. Additionally, AIGC\u2019s video enhance-\nment tools can improve video clarity. Furthermore, AIGC can\nsynthesize broadcast videos using news text during a news\nbroadcast, which delivers more ef\ufb01cient and accurate results\nthan manual generation.\nD. E-commerce\nE-commerce is another mature application \ufb01eld for intel-\nligent text generation. At present, most product titles and\ndescriptions on e-commerce websites, such as JD.com and\nTaobao [105], [106], are generated automatically by algo-\nrithms. In addition, e-commerce websites commonly imple-\nment intelligent customer service systems to address users\u2019\ninquiries pertaining to shopping, post-sale assistance, and\nother communication necessities [107], [108]. The intelligent\ncustomer service system must have the ability to accurately\ncomprehend the user\u2019s intention and utilize text-generation\ntechniques to generate an appropriate response. Moreover,\ncertain e-commerce websites utilize dialogue summary tech-\nnology to condense the exchanges between customer service\nand users into a concise summary [109], [110]. Finally, in\norder to promote their goods and services, many companies\nuse intelligent text generation technology to generate adver-\ntising and marketing copy for their products, which they then\ndisseminate across a variety of multimedia platforms in order\nto attract users\u2019 attention and boost sales [111]. It can be seen\nthat intelligent text generation technology has been applied to\nall aspects of e-commerce, and the use of this technology can\nreduce the cost of labor.\n14\nNews gathering and editing\nNews manuscript writing\nNews video clipping\nNews broadcast\n\u25c6Speech to text:\nAutomatic \nrecording \narrangement, \nensure the \ntimeliness of \nnews, reduce \nmechanical \nduplication of \nlabor.\n\u25c6Structured text \nwriting: \nAlgorithm-based \npress releases \nthat speed up \ncontent \nproduction and \nimprove content \naccuracy.\n\u25c6Automatic video editing: \nQuickly generate videos from \nmaterials, reduce manual editing \nlabor, and speed up frequency \nrelease.\n\u25c6Cross-modal video generation \ntext:\nAutomatically generates subtitles \nsynchronized with the video.\n\u25c6Video attribute editing: \nVideo enhancement tools to \nimprove video clarity and bring \nviewers better experience.\n\u25c6Cross-modal video \nsynthesis: \nSynthesizing anchorman \nvideos from press \nreleases improves \nbroadcasting efficiency \nand accuracy and brings \naudiences different \nbroadcasting experience.\nFig. 14: AIGC\u2019s empowerment in the \ufb01eld of media.\nE. Film\nThe combination of AIGC and \ufb01lm has enormous potential\nto inspire directors with fresh creative ideas [112]. By assisting\nwith scriptwriting, replacing original roles and settings, and\nsimplifying post-production editing, AIGC can help overcome\nphysical limitations and improve the quality of \ufb01lms. For\nexample, AI technology can analyze vast amounts of script\ndata and generate scripts that \ufb01t predetermined styles, which\ncan stimulate directors\u2019 creativity. After reviewing and re-\n\ufb01ning the AI-generated script, the director can signi\ufb01cantly\nreduce the time needed for script creation and increase overall\nproductivity. During video capture, AI technology allows for\n\ufb02exible replacement of characters and backgrounds, and can\neven create digital avatars capable of complex actions. AI can\nalso create virtual scenes and depict scenarios that cannot be\ncaptured in real-time. It provides a more immersive viewing\nexperience for audiences. In post-production editing, AI can be\nused to repair \ufb01lm images and enhance picture quality, as well\nas quickly generate promotional movie trailers for publicity.\nF. Application in other \ufb01elds\nWith big data still in its blooming stage, the growth of AI-\npowered data-driven technologies will bring more opportuni-\nties in the future. In our opinion, AIGC has a wide range of\napplications beyond the \ufb01elds mentioned above. For example,\nin education, AI technology can convert abstract textbooks\ninto concrete visualizations, making it easier for students to\nlearn [113]. In \ufb01nance, AI can automatically produce \ufb01nancial\ninformation videos and create virtual digital customer service\nto improve operational ef\ufb01ciency [114]. In healthcare, AI can\nassist patients in rehabilitation and enhance medical imaging\nto aid doctors in diagnosing conditions [115]. Additionally,\nspeech synthesis technology can generate speech audio for\nindividuals with aphasia, enabling them to communicate effec-\ntively. In industry, AIGC can rapidly transform digital geome-\ntry into real-time 3D models based on physical environments,\nand digital factories can analyze process \ufb02ow to reduce design\ntime [116]. All in all, there are still too many applications that\ncannot be listed one-by-one, and need to be further explored.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWith the support of massive amounts of high-quality data\nand high-performance hardware, a number of algorithms for\nlarge models have rapidly developed in recent years. These\nalgorithms possess the ability not only to comprehend text\nbut also to assist in, or automatically generate rich content.\nApplication examples such as ChatGPT have demonstrated\nthe business value and application performance of AIGC\ntechnology, leading to widespread attention and investment\nfrom numerous front-line companies in a short period of time.\nThis paper provides a brief introduction to AIGC technology\nand presents its distinct features. Furthermore, we conduct\na comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages\nof AIGC capabilities. However, the development of AIGC\nstill faces many challenges and opportunities. We also pro-\nvide insights into AIGC challenges and future directions. In\nconclusion, we hope that this review will provide useful ideas\nfor the development of academia, industry, and business, as\nwell as valuable thinking directions and insights for further\nexploration in the \ufb01eld of AIGC.\nREFERENCES\n[1] W.

By\ncomparing these generators, our results may assist practitioners in selecting the optimal\ntool for specific tasks, enhancing their decision-making process.\nKeywords ChatGPT, OpenAI, Amazon CodeWhisperer, GitHub Copilot, code\ngeneration, code completion, AI pair programmer, empirical study\n1 Introduction\nCode completion and generation tools are essential for enhancing programmers\u2019 per-\nformance and output quality in software development. Omar et al. (2012) define code\ncompletion tools as tools that are offered in most editors, which list contextually-relevant\nvariables, fields, methods, types, and other code snippets in the form of a floating menu.\nBy exploring and making choices from this menu, developers can avoid frequent gram-\nmatical and logical errors, reduce redundant keystrokes, and explore new APIs without\nhaving to go through the mental effort of switching to an external documentation tool\nor API browser. Some of the well-known code completion tools include IntelliSense in\nVisual Studio Code1 and the built-in code completion in the JetBrains IDEs2. Although\nthese tools can output code snippets, they differ fundamentally from code generators.\nThe advent of advanced language processing technologies has led to the emergence\nof Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs have numerous use cases, we focus on\ntheir code generation capabilities. Unlike code completion tools, code generators actively\nutilize LLMs by providing the programmer\u2019s input to the specified LLM and returning\nthe output to the programmer\u2019s workspace. Currently, code generators\u2019 outputs cannot\nbe produced locally, unlike code completion tools. Additionally, code generators can\ngenerate longer outputs in the form of lines or blocks of code, which can build function\nbodies or other constructs. Moreover, code generators can convert natural language\ninputs into source code, a key distinction from code completion tools.\nOur motivation for conducting this study stems from the growing interest in AI-\nassisted code generators and the spread of unverified information about them. We\nrecognize the popularity and potential of state-of-the-art AI-assisted code generators, as\nwell as the heuristic feedback from various communities. In line with our previous study\n(Yetistiren et al., 2022), we believe it is worthwhile to evaluate the potential benefits\nof these generators. Although these tools can generate code, their value remains unde-\ntermined. To systematically assess these code generators, we propose an experimental\nsetup evaluating the generated code based on Code Validity, Code Correctness, Code\nSecurity, Code Reliability, and Code Maintainability.\nWe have chosen GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT for our\nstudy, leading us to formulate the following research questions:\nRQ1 What is the quality of the code generated by the code generation tools?\n1 code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense\n2 jetbrains.com\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n3\nRQ1.1 How valid are the code generation tools\u2019 code suggestions?\nRQ1.2 How correct are code generation tools\u2019 code suggestions?\nRQ1.3 How secure are code generation tools\u2019 code suggestions?\nRQ1.4 How reliable are code generation tools\u2019 code suggestions?\nRQ1.5 How maintainable are code generation tools\u2019 code suggestions?\nRQ2 What is the impact of using the docstrings on the generated code quality?\nRQ3 What is the impact of using meaningful function names on the generated code\nquality?\nRQ4 How did the code generation tools evolve over time?\nWe believe our study will enable users to more effectively leverage AI-assisted code\ngenerators for generating accurate, valid, reliable, maintainable, and secure results.\nIn addition, tool developers can benefit from our findings to identify and enhance\nthe strengths and address the weaknesses of their tools in real-world situations. The\ncomparative aspect of our study provides valuable insights into the performance of each\ncode generation tool relative to its competitors.\nThe structure of our study is as follows: In Section 2, we provide some background\ninformation about the code generation tools we evaluate. In Section 3, we provide a\ndetailed explanation of the research questions we have determined by elaborating on our\nexperimental setup. Our results are presented in Section 4, and they are discussed in\nSection 5. The threats that influence the validity of our study are addressed in Section\n6. In Section 7, we discuss related work. Finally, in Section 8, we conclude our study.\n2 Background\n2.1 GitHub Copilot\nGitHub Copilot3 is a code generation tool that utilizes a variety of technologies, including\na compatible IDE, and the OpenAI Codex Model4. GitHub announced GitHub Copilot\nfor technical preview in the Visual Studio Code development environment on June 29,\n2021 (Friedman, 2021). GitHub declared on June 21, 2022, that Copilot was out of\nthe technical preview phase and is now accessible as a subscription-based service for\nindividual developers (Dohmke, 2022). It currently has subscription plans for individuals\nand businesses. GitHub Copilot can be installed and used as an extension to Visual\nStudio Code, Neovim, IDEs developed by JetBrains5, and GitHub Codespaces6. The\nunderlying service continuously takes user code samples and sends the snippets to the\nunderlying OpenAI Codex Model. GitHub Copilot generates the code and presents the\nresults of the OpenAI Codex Model by adjusting the generated code to the current\nworkspace of the programmer (Ernst and Bavota, 2022).\nThe Codex model relies on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models the\ncompany previously invented for text generation. The public code available on GitHub\nwas used during the fine-tuning of the model to implement the code recognition and\ngeneration capabilities.\n3 copilot.github.com\n4 openai.com/blog/openai-codex\n5 plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot\n6 github.com/features/codespaces\n4\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nFeatures\nChatGPT\nAmazon CodeWhisperer\nGitHub Copilot\nIDE Support\nNo IDE Support\nJetBrains, Visual Studio\nCode, AWS Cloud9, or the\nAWS Lambda console\nIntelliJ IDEA, Android Stu-\ndio, AppCode, CLion, Code\nWith Me Guest, DataGrip,\nDataSpell,\nGoLand,\nJet-\nBrains Client, MPS, Ph-\npStorm, PyCharm, Rider,\nRubyMine, WebStorm\nFirst Release Time\nNov-30-2022\nJune-23-2022\nOct-29-2021\nDeveloper\nOpenAI\nAWS\nOpenAI-Microsoft\nProviding\nReferences\nto\nSuggestions\nNO\nYES\nNO\nExplanation of Suggestions\nYES\nNO\nNO\nProviding Multiple Sugges-\ntions\nNO (Theoretically user can\nmanually ask for another\nsuggestion.)\nYES (Up to 5)\nYES (Up to 10)\nTraining Data Source\nGitHub Repositories,\nOpenAI\nCodex\nDataset,\nother code repositories such\nas GitLab, Bitbucket, and\nSourceForge\n\u201cVast amounts of publicly\navailable code\"\n\u201c...trained on all languages\nthat appear in public repos-\nitories\" (Fine-tuned)\nProgramming\nLanguages\nwork best with (according\nto the vendor)\nN/A\nC#,\nJava,\nJavaScript,\nPython, and TypeScript\nC, C++, C#, Go, Java,\nJavaScript, PHP, Python,\nRuby,\nScala,\nand\nType-\nScript\nMultipurpose (other than\nprogramming)\nYES\nNO\nNO\nSubscription\nChatGPT Free\nChatGPT Plus ($20 per\nmonth)\nFree Preview\nCopilot for Students (Free)\nCopilot for Individuals ($10\nper month)\nCopilot for Business ($19\nper user, per month)\nCan be Used Offline?\nNO\nNO\nNO\nCan it Access Local Files?\nNO\nYES\nYES\nTable 1 Comparing Relevant Code Generation Tools\n2.2 Amazon CodeWhisperer\nAmazon CodeWhisperer7 improves developer productivity by generating code recom-\nmendations based on both developers\u2019 comments in English and prior code in the IDE.\nAWS announced Amazon CodeWhisperer Preview on June 23, 2022, (Bays, 2022). The\ncode recommendations provided by CodeWhisperer are based on ML models trained\non various data sources, such as Amazon\u2019s sources and other open-source codes. When\ndevelopers write a comment in their IDE\u2019s code editor, CodeWhisperer will automati-\ncally examine the comment and determine the best-suited cloud services and public\nlibraries. Then, it will provide a code snippet directly within the code editor. Moreover,\nCodeWhisperer simplifies the use of AWS services for developers by offering suggestions\nfor AWS API code across top services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2),\nAWS Lambda, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).\nCodeWhisperer supports multiple IDEs including JetBrains, Visual Studio Code,\nAWS Cloud9, or the AWS Lambda console as part of the AWS IDE toolkit. Moreover,\nit currently supports Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and Typescript. As an additional\nfeature, CodeWhisperer has a reference tracker that detects the code recommendations\nsimilar to particular CodeWhisperer training data and provides those references to\ndevelopers. CodeWhisperer can also scan the code and define the security issues.\n7 aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n5\n2.3 ChatGPT\nChatGPT8 is a language model announced by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. The\nsubscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, is available since February 1, 2023 (OpenAI, 2023).\nChatGPT uses advanced machine learning algorithms to generate human-like text\nresponses. It is trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet. It is capable\nof answering a wide range of questions, admitting its mistakes, challenging incorrect\npremises, and rejecting inappropriate requests. While the primary purpose of a chatbot\nis to imitate human conversation, ChatGPT is highly versatile and can perform a wide\nrange of tasks such as coding and debugging software, providing responses to exam\nquestions, composing poetic works and musical lyrics, and more (Tung, 2023).\nChatGPT has been adjusted specifically from a model within the GPT-3.5 series9,\nwhich completed its training process early in 2022 using supervised learning as well\nas reinforcement learning. Moreover, OpenAI continues to gather information from\nChatGPT users to improve and refine its performance.\nIt is also notable that ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing app in history\naccording to the study of the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS). In January 2023,\nChatGPT attracted 13 million unique visitors daily, over twice the number it received\nin December according to the study. The report also states that despite being only two\nmonths old, ChatGPT has already reached a monthly user base of 100 million. (Cerullo,\n2023).\n2.4 Comparison of ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Amazon CodeWhisperer\nWhen we performed the experiment on GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and\nChatGPT for our study, we could observe some advantages and limitations of the tools.\nAccording to our observations, and the background knowledge we stated above, we\ncreated Table 1. In the table, it can be seen that while GitHub Copilot and Amazon\nCodeWhisperer have IDE support, ChatGPT does not have this yet, apart from its API\nsupport. Moreover, as we mentioned in earlier parts of Section 2, ChatGPT and Amazon\nCodeWhisperer were introduced in 2022. However, GitHub Copilot was announced in\n2021. Hence, it can be said that GitHub Copilot is one of the pioneers of this field.\nAdditionally, it is notable that OpenAI developed both ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot\nwhile AWS developed Amazon CodeWhisperer. ChatGPT does not have any specific\ninformation about supported programming languages but GitHub Copilot and Amazon\nCodeWhisperer specify the supported programming languages and we can see that\nGitHub Copilot supports more programming languages than Amazon CodeWhisperer in\nTable 1. Although Amazon CodeWhisperer is still free as it is in the technical preview\nstage, and GitHub Copilot has different subscription plans. ChatGPT is also available\nin the technical preview but it also has a subscription plan.\nFurthermore, we added our observations about the tools to Table 1. Firstly, we\nobserved that Amazon CodeWhisperer and GitHub Copilot could provide more than\none recommendation and it would be easy to choose the most relevant one from the\noptions for users. By contrast, ChatGPT mainly provided one suggestion at a time\nunless we did not ask for additional suggestions. On the other hand, ChatGPT was the\n8 openai.com/blog/chatgpt\n9 platform.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers\n6\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nonly tool that explained its recommendations in detail and was used for purposes other\nthan programming. We also observed Amazon CodeWhisperer was the only tool that\npresented the recommendations\u2019 source. It is notable to mention that while Amazon\nCodeWhisperer and GitHub Copilot could access users\u2019 local files, ChatGPT could not\naccess them. Lastly, we observed that none of these tools could be used offline.\n3 Methodology\nUnder the subsections below, we elaborate on our methodology. Section 3.1 gives detail\nabout the data we use. To address the research questions, we created an experimental\nsetup, which systematically evaluates the effectiveness of code generation tools, that is\ndescribed in Section 3.2. The details of our assessment are presented in Section 3.3. In\nSections 3.4 and 3.5, we elaborate on the two additional experiments we conducted to\ntest the effect of the function names and explanations of the generated code quality.\nMoreover, we use different versions of GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer to\nassess the performance of those code generation tools over time, which is described in\nSection 3.6.\ntask_id\nHumanEval/0\nprompt\nfrom typing import List\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\"\ncanonical_solution\n    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):\n        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):\n            if idx != idx2:\n                distance = abs(elem - elem2)\n                if distance < threshold:\n                    return True\n    return False\ntest\nMETADATA = {\n    'author': 'jt',\n    'dataset': 'test'\n}\ndef check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) == True\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05) == False\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95) == True\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8) == False\n    assert candidate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1) == True\n    assert candidate([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0) == True\n    assert candidate([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5) == False\nFig. 1 Example Problem (ID: 0) from HumanEval dataset\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n7\nfrom\ntyping\nimport\nList\ndef\nhas_close_elements (numbers: List[float], threshold: float) ->\nbool:\n\"\"\"\nCheck if in given\nlist of numbers , are any two\nnumbers\ncloser\nto each\nother\nthan\ngiven\nthreshold.\n>>> has_close_elements ([1.0 , 2.0, 3.0] , 0.5)\nFalse\n>>> has_close_elements ([1.0 , 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] , 0.3)\nTrue\n\"\"\"\nfor i in range(len(numbers)):\nfor j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):\nif abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:\nreturn\nTrue\nreturn\nFalse\nListing 1 Generated Code for the Example Problem by GitHub Copilot v1.7.4421 (ID: 0)\n3.1 HumanEval Dataset\nFor our experiment, we use the HumanEval dataset proposed by Chen et al. (2021). This\ndataset contains 164 problems. Each problem is accompanied by a task ID, a prompt,\nthe canonical solution, and unit tests. The structure of a problem can be viewed in\nFigure 1. The task ID is the ID of that particular problem which ranges from 0 to 163.\nThe prompt part contains the function prototype, the explanation of the problem, some\nfunction calls and their output in a Python docstring, and library imports, if applicable.\nA canonical solution is considered as a correct solution which is coded by a \u201chuman\u201d\nprogrammer. The test part contains unit tests as a Python function.\nWe pass the function prototype and the docstring as input to code generation tools.\nAn example code generation done by GitHub Copilot, where the input problem is shown\nin Figure 1 can be viewed in Listing 1.\n3.2 Experimental Setup\nIn Figure 2, we focus on what artifacts were employed for which tools, and which metric\nthese combinations correspond to. Whereas in Figure 3, we provide a step-by-step\nillustration of the experiment\u2019s workflow. In this figure, given the HumanEval problem\ndataset (Chen et al., 2021), we start our experiment by extracting the problems. We\nachieve this by reading the dataset and representing each problem with a separate\nJSON format file. After completing the extraction procedure, we save the unit tests\nand the prompt of a problem as separate Python files to the directory corresponding\nto the problem\u2019s ID. Subsequently, we generate solutions using an already prepared\nPython file containing the prompt. This prompt combines the function signature and\ndocstring contained in the function body. Given the dynamic characteristic of code\ngeneration tools, GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT, in terms\nof the interactions between the programmer and the service, we implement the code\ngeneration step of our experiment manually by employing the Visual Studio Code IDE\nfor GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer and using the interface provided by\nOpenAI in a given browser for ChatGPT.

After this, we utilize SonarQube to find the security\nrating, the number of bugs, and the number of code smells for each problem, these\ncorrespond to the Code Security, Code Reliability, and Code Maintainability metrics.\nWe detect the bugs and code smells separately, since the code smells are mostly different\nthan bugs, they do not necessarily cause the code to be incorrect, but introduce some\nuneasiness in the code which can cause more problems in the future. For each step of\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n9\nthe assessment phase, we save the individual assessment results related to the problem.\nThe extracted results can be seen in our reproduction package10.\nWe further test the validity of our findings in our literature survey about providing\ncode generation tools with code comments and function signatures, by implementing\ntwo additional experiments about the significance of function names, parameters, and\ncomments explained in Sections 3.4 and 3.5.\n3.3 Code Metrics\nWe have evaluated our results in terms of code validity, code correctness, code security,\ncode reliability, and code maintainability. Our metric for code validity is binary, in\nwhich we have two possible values, \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 indicating if the solution is valid or not.\nThis is assessed in terms of how a given code segment is compliant with the rules and\nregulations (i.e., syntax rules) of a given programming language and with any errors\nthat could be raised during runtime. The dataset we use is constructed for the Python\nprogramming language; therefore, to check for code validity, we use the Python 3.10.10\ninterpreter.\nFor code correctness, we want to assess the extent to which the generated code\nperforms as intended. As we previously stated, the problems in the HumanEval dataset\nare accompanied by problem-specific unit tests. On average, each problem comes with\n7.7 unit tests (Chen et al., 2021). We measured the code correctness as passed unit\ntests divided by all unit tests for a specific problem. Considering the abundance of unit\ntests, we believe that the most convenient way to assess code correctness is to make use\nof the provided tests.\nWe have also evaluated the average code correctness which is measured as the sum\nof all code correctness scores divided by the problem count. While calculating average\ncode correctness, we consider the code correctness score of invalid code generations as 0.\nWe show our calculation methods for Code Correctness and Average Code Correct-\nness below. CCS stands for Code Correctness Score, and CCSi is the Code Correctness\nScore for the ith problem. The range of i is 0 to 163.\nCode Correctness =\nP163\ni=0 CCSi [CCSi = 1]\n164\nAverage Code Correctness =\nP163\ni=0 CCSi\n164\nFinally, we used SonarQube11 to assess code security, code reliability, and code\nmaintainability metrics. For code security, we define the term vulnerability, which\ncompromises the security of the code; therefore, introducing security risks, considering\nthe possible deployment of the code in question as software or part of the software. We\nuse SonarQube\u2019s Security Module to assess code security. This module calculates the\nnumber of vulnerabilities in a given code. To assess code maintainability, SonarQube\n10 https://github.com/mirayayerdem/Github-Copilot-Amazon-Whisperer-\nChatGPT/blob/main/misc/All_Experiment_Results.xlsx\n11 sonarqube.org\n10\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nruns its evaluation on the given code in terms of the count of code smells present in the\ncode. For code reliability, we count the number of bugs in the code using SonarQube.\n3.4 Using only Function Signatures (RQ2)\nIn this experiment, we removed the docstrings from the problems to assess the effect of\ndocstrings on the generated solution. The docstring of a given problem in the HumanEval\ndataset includes the explanation of the function as the intended purpose of what that\nproblem should be doing. This explanation is then accompanied by some sample test\ncases and their results (an example can be seen in the \u201cprompt\u201d part in Figure 1). We\nused GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT to generate code by only\nusing the name and the parameters of the function as a reference. We aimed to see how\nour results would change in comparison to our previous results.\n3.5 Using Dummy Function Names (RQ3)\nWe changed the function names of the problems with the dummy function name \u2018foo\u2019,\nto assess the effect of meaningful function names on the generated solution. The tools\nare then employed to generate code with such inputs. We assess the generated code\nusing the Code Validity and Correctness metrics.\n3.6 Evaluation of Code Generation Tools Over Time (RQ4)\nSince the initial release of GitHub Copilot, there were multiple official updates that\nthe tool received, apart from the continuous training of the underlying LLM of GitHub\nCopilot. Considering that we have ready-to-use results for GitHub Copilot from our\nold study (Yetistiren et al., 2022), as a part of this study we are also evaluating how a\ngiven code generation tool has evolved over time. In that regard, we will be comparing\nGitHub Copilot v1.7.4421 and v1.70.8099 versions. Since AWS does not specify the\nversion of CodeWhisperer, we are unable to specify the versions we have used to run\nthe prior and later experiments; we can only provide the dates of our two experiments,\nwhich are November \u201822 for prior and January \u201823 for the latter experiment. For this\nresearch question, we use the Code Correctness and Code Validity metrics for the three\nexperiment types we explained in Sections 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5.\n4 Results\n4.1 Code Validity (RQ1.1)\nThe use of interpreters in Python made it easier for us to evaluate code validity by\nsimply trying to execute the code and catch errors at runtime. This should not be\nconfused with runtime errors; in Python, like runtime errors, the syntax errors can\nalso be detected by executing the script, unlike the compiler approach used in other\nhigh-level programming languages like Java and C++.\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n11\nFig. 4 Distribution of Validly Generated Samples among the Code Generation Tools\nAs we noted earlier, our metric for code validity is binary, such that if any errors were\nraised during the execution of a given Python script, we denoted that script as invalid.\nMoreover, for such scripts, we did not calculate the correctness score, as consideration\nof such scores could impose possible threats to the validity of our evaluation.\nThe full Code Validity results of our experiments can be visualized in Figure 4. Out\nof 164 generations of GitHub Copilot to the problems, 150 were valid. This yielded a\n91.5% success rate in terms of generating valid code. Amazon CodeWhisperer generated\na valid code for 148 of the problems, which yields a 90.2% success rate. ChatGPT was\nable to generate a valid code for 153 problems, which yields a 93.3% success rate.\n4.2 Code Correctness (RQ1.2)\nWe used the number of passed unit tests divided by all unit tests to calculate the\nsuccess percentage of the code for each problem, which we have defined in Section 3.3.\nIn Figures 6 - 11, we provided the percentage distribution of code generations falling\nunder different categories (correct, partially correct, and incorrect). Moreover, we also\nmeasured the average code correctness score by dividing the summation of all code\ncorrectness scores by the number of all problems, which we have again defined in Section\n3.3. In Figure 5, we provided the comparisons of code correctness scores and average\ncode correctness scores among code generation tools.\n12\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nFig. 5 Code Correctness and Average Code Correctness Scores of the Code Generation Tools\n46.3%\nProportion of Correct\nGenerations\n23.2%\nProportion of Partially\nCorrect Generations\n30.5%\nProportion of Incorrect\nGenerations\nFig. 6 Distribution of Code Generations in terms of Correctness for GitHub Copilot\n26.3%\n100% > CCSi > 75%\n34.2%\n75% \u2265CCSi > 50%\n23.7%\n50% \u2265CCSi > 25%\n15.8%\n25% \u2265CCSi > 0%\nFig. 7 Distribution of Correctness Scores among Partially Correct Generations for GitHub\nCopilot\nWe observed that for 46.3% of the problems, GitHub Copilot managed to generate\nthe correct code for the given problem, whereas it completely failed to provide a\ncorrect solution for 30.5% of the problems. Generated solutions for the remaining\n23.2% of the problems were partially correct, as shown in Figure 6. Partially correct\ngenerations are the ones that pass at least one of the unit tests but not all of them.\nWe believe partially correct generations are useful, with the assumption that if at least\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n13\none unit test is passing, this is a potential indicator that with further improvements\nby the programmer, the code could become correct. To analyze the partially correct\ncode generations, we created a second pie chart in Figure 7, in which we eliminated\ncorrect and incorrect code generations, yielding 38 problems. We divided (0, 100)\nsuccess space into four intervals. GitHub Copilot managed a success rate of 26.3%\nfor the interval of 100% > CCSi > 75%, where CCSi refers to the code correctness\nscore of the problem.

The next interval contained the\npartially correct code generations with a score of 23.7%, belonging to the interval of\n50% \u2265CCSi > 25%. For the last interval of 25% \u2265CCSi > 0%, the score was 15.8%.\nWe also found the average code correctness score of GitHub Copilot as 59.85%, shown\nin Figure 5.\n31.1%\nProportion of Correct\nGenerations\n40.2%\nProportion of Partially\nCorrect Generations\n28.7%\nProportion of Incorrect\nGenerations\nFig. 8 Distribution of Code Generations in terms of Correctness for Amazon Code Whisperer\n15.2%\n100% > CCSi > 75%\n37.9%\n75% \u2265CCSi > 50%\n21.2%\n50% \u2265CCSi > 25%\n25.7%\n25% \u2265CCSi > 0%\nFig. 9 Distribution of Correctness Scores among Partially Correct Generations for Amazon\nCode Whisperer\nAmazon CodeWhisperer was able to generate the correct code for 31.1% of the\nproblems, whereas it completely failed to provide a correct solution for 28.7% of the\nproblems.

We also found the average code correctness\nscore of ChatGPT as 78.1%, shown in Figure 5.\n4.3 Code Security & Code Reliability & Code Maintainability (RQ1.3 & RQ1.4 &\nRQ1.5)\nFor Code Security, Maintainability, and Reliability, we employed SonarQube to find the\nsecurity rating, the number of bugs, and the number of smells for each problem. The\nresults of our evaluation can be visualized in Table 2.\nFor none of the problems for all of the generators, we did not see any security rating\nthat was below 1, which is the maximum possible rating. Due to the constraints of the\ndataset we used for our study, the security results we obtained were limited. The usage\nof an alternative dataset with a different problem scope, and problems that yield longer\nsolutions may reflect better Code Security results.\nRegarding Code Reliability, there were three problems containing a single bug for\nGitHub Copilot, one problem containing a single bug for Amazon CodeWhisperer, and\ntwo problems containing a single bug for ChatGPT. All of the bugs observed in the\ngenerations provided by Copilot (Problem IDs: #33, #37, #100) were categorized\nas major bugs by SonarQube, and the time required to solve the given bug was 15\nminutes each. All of these problems were bug-free when their solutions were generated\nby Amazon CodeWhisperer or ChatGPT. The single bug (Problem ID: #102) we\nobserved with the solutions of Amazon CodeWhisperer was again a major bug, and the\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n15\nTable 3 List of the Code Smells of the Generated Code\nCopilot\nCodeWhisperer\nChatGPT\nCode Smell\nNumber of Problems\nTechnical Debt\nSeverity\n- Rename this variable; it shadows a built-in.\n6\n2\n1\n5 mins\nMajor\n- Remove the unused function parameter.\n1\n5\n0\n5 mins\nMajor\n- Refactor this function to reduce its Cognitive\nComplexity.\n6\n2\n2\n-\nCritical\n- Merge this if statement with the enclosing\none.\n2\n0\n1\n5 mins\nMajor\n- Rename this parameter x to match the regular\nexpression \u02c6[_a-z][a-z0-9_]*$.\n2\n2\n2\n2 mins\nMinor\n- Remove the unused local variable x.\n2\n0\n4\n5 mins\nMinor\n- Rename function x to match the regular ex-\npression \u02c6[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$.\n5\n5\n5\n10 mins\nMajor\n- Specify an exception class to catch or reraise\nthe exception.\n1\n0\n0\n5 mins\nCritical\n- Extract this nested conditional expression into\nan independent statement.\n1\n0\n0\n5 mins\nMajor\n- Complete the task associated to this \u201cTODO\"\ncomment.\n0\n7\n0\n0 mins\nInfo\n- Remove commented out code.\n0\n3\n0\n5 mins\nMajor\n- Use concise character class syntax \u2018\\d\u2019 instead\nof \u2018[0-9]\u2019.\n0\n0\n2\n5 mins\nMinor\n- Replace this x call by a y function call.\n0\n0\n1\n2 mins\nCritical\nNote: Versions considered for this table: GitHub Copilot - 1.70.8099, Amazon CodeWhisperer - Jan \u201923, ChatGPT - 9 Jan 2023 Version\ncorresponding solutions generated by the other generators were bug-free. The estimated\ntime to solve this bug was five minutes. For ChatGPT, we had a blocker (Problem ID:\n#8), and a major bug (Problem ID: #141). The estimated time to solve the bug in\nproblem #8 was 15 minutes, and this was 10 minutes for problem #141. Again, the\nbugs were unique to ChatGPT among all the generators.\nRegarding Code Maintainability, we created a list of the code smells encountered\nin the generated code, shown in Table 3. Here we list each smell, accompanied by the\nfrequencies we have encountered for each code generator, the technical debt of the\nparticular smell (estimated time to resolve the issue), and the severity of the smell. As\nseen in Table 2, 14 problems contained a single, three problems contained two, and 2\nproblems contained three code smells. The average technical debt for the problems that\ncontained at least one smell was 9.1 minutes and the total estimated time to solve every\nsmell was 172 minutes. For Amazon CodeWhisperer, we have encountered 22 problems\nwhere there were single, and 2 problems with two code smells. There were not any\ninstances, which contained more than two code smells. The average technical debt for\nthe problems containing at least one smell was 5.6 minutes, and the total estimated time\nto solve the smells was 117 minutes. For ChatGPT, there were 13 problems containing a\nsingle, and 1 problem containing two code smells. On average, the technical debt of the\nproblems accompanied by at least a single smell was 8.9 minutes. The total estimated\ntime to solve all the smells was 134 minutes.\n16\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nTable 4 Percentage Results of all code generation tools for Original Experiment (ORG), Only\nFunction Name (OFN) and Dummy Function Name (DFN)\nCopilot v1.70.8099 (New)\nCodeWhisperer Jan \u201923 (New)\nChatGPT 9 Jan \u201923 Version\nORG\nOFN\nDFN\nORG\nOFN\nDFN\nORG\nOFN\nDFN\nValid\n91.5%\n78.0%\n93.9%\n90.2%\n78.0%\n89.6%\n93.3%\n76.8%\n92.7%\nCorrect\n46.3%\n20.1%\n42.1%\n31.1%\n14.6%\n27.4%\n65.2%\n22.0%\n61.6%\nPartially Correct\n23.2%\n26.8%\n26.8%\n40.2%\n29.9%\n36.6%\n22.6%\n27.4%\n25.6%\nIncorrect\n30.5%\n53.1%\n31.1%\n28.7%\n55.5%\n36.0%\n12.2%\n50.6%\n12.8%\n4.4 Using only Function Names and Parameters Without Prompt (RQ2)\nThe results we presented up until this point were the outputs of the experiment where\nwe provided the function name, parameters, and the docstring as the inputs to get the\ngenerated code. In this part, as we explained in Section 3.2, we removed the docstring\nfrom each of our problems in the dataset. The results of this experiment are presented\nin Table 4.\nIn our original experiment where we used both the function name and the prompt,\nour code validity score was 91.5% for GitHub Copilot, 90.2% for Amazon CodeWhisperer,\nand 93.3% for ChatGPT. In our latter experiment, where we only used the function\nnames, our code validity score dropped to 78.0% for GitHub Copilot, 78.0% for Amazon\nCodeWhisperer, and 76.8% for ChatGPT.\nFor code correctness, if we compare the results of the two experiments for GitHub\nCopilot, the rate of correctly generated code dropped from 46.3% to 20.1%. The\nincorrectly generated code percentage increased from 30.5% to 53.1%, and the partially\ncorrectly generated code percentage increased from 23.2% to 26.8%. For Amazon\nCodeWhisperer, the rate of correctly generated code dropped from 31.1% to 14.6%. The\nincorrectly generated code percentage increased from 28.7% to 55.5%, and the partially\ncorrectly generated code percentage decreased from 40.2% to 29.9%. For ChatGPT,\nthe rate of correctly generated code dropped from 65.2% to 22.0%. The incorrectly\ngenerated code percentage increased from 12.2% to 50.6%, and the partially correctly\ngenerated code percentage increased from 22.6% to 27.4%.\n4.5 Using Dummy Function Names (RQ3)\nIn this part, as explained in Section 3.2, we prompted GitHub Copilot, Amazon\nCodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT to generate code for the same problems, this time with\ndummy function names instead of meaningful, and informative function names. We\nreplaced the function names with \u2018foo\u2019. The original and new experiment results are\npresented in Table 4.\nOur code validity score increased to 93.9% for GitHub Copilot and decreased to\n89.6% for Amazon CodeWhisperer and 92.7% for ChatGPT.\nFor code correctness, if we compare the results of the two experiments for GitHub\nCopilot, the rate of correctly generated code dropped from 46.3% to 42.1%. The\nincorrectly generated code percentage increased from 30.5% to 31.1%, and the partially\ncorrectly generated code percentage increased from 23.2% to 26.8%. For Amazon\nCodeWhisperer, the rate of correctly generated code dropped from 31.1% to 27.4%. The\nincorrectly generated code percentage increased from 28.7% to 36.0%, and the partially\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n17\ncorrectly generated code percentage decreased from 40.2% to 36.6%.

The incorrectly\ngenerated code percentage increased from 12.2% to 12.8%, and the partially correctly\ngenerated code percentage increased from 22.6% to 25.6%.\n4.6 Evaluation of Code Generation Tools Over Time (RQ4)\nIn this part, as explained in Section 3.6, we have evaluated GitHub Copilot and Amazon\nCodeWhisperer using the newer versions.\nAs shown in Figure 12, compared to the experiment results where we used older\nversions of GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer, our code validity score, 91.5%,\ndid not change for GitHub Copilot and the validity score of Amazon CodeWhisperer,\nthe validity score dropped to 90.2% (from 95.1%).\nFor code correctness, if we compare the results of the two experiments for GitHub\nCopilot, the rate of correctly generated code increased to 46.3% (from 28.7%). The\nincorrectly generated code percentage increased to 30.5% (from 20.1%), and the partially\ncorrectly generated code percentage decreased to 23.2% (from 51.2%). For Amazon\nCodeWhisperer, the rate of correctly generated code increased to 31.1% (from 24.4%).\nThe incorrectly generated code percentage decreased to 28.7% (from 45.1%), and the\npartially correctly generated code percentage increased to 40.2% (from 30.5%).\n5 Discussion\n5.1 Code Validity (RQ1.1)\nAs we discussed, for our 164 problems, GitHub Copilot was able to generate valid code\nfor 150 of them, yielding a success rate of 91.5%. Amazon CodeWhisperer was able to\ngenerate valid code for 148 problems, yielding a success rate of 90.2% and ChatGPT\nwas able to generate valid code for 153 of them, yielding a success rate of 93.3%.\nThe causes of the invalid code generated by GitHub Copilot were operations with\nincompatible types (Listing 2), syntax errors, and usage of the functions of unimported\nlibraries.\nAmazon CodeWhisperer had the following causes preventing a particular code from\nbeing valid: usage of the functions of unimported libraries (Listing 3), improper list\nindexing, operations with incompatible types, searching for values that are not in a\nparticular list (Listing 4), incorrect usage of the assert statements, syntax errors, and\nstack overflow errors.\nLastly, ChatGPT had the following causes for invalid code: improper list and string\nindexing, syntax errors (Listing 5), operations with incompatible types (Listing 6), and\nthe usage of the functions of unimported libraries.\nFrom these results, we can see that there were many common issues among the code\ngeneration tools that were the causes of invalid code. While the frequencies of these\nissues were not unique among the tools, the small number of invalid codes should refrain\nus to make a generalization of any issue to correspond to a particular tool more than\nsome other one. We argue that the occurrence of similar issues among the tools, also\nthe similar rates of success of the code generation tools suggest that they are practically\nsimilar to each other in terms of being able to successfully generate valid code. The\n18\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nFig. 12 Code Validity Scores of the Code Generation Tools\napproximation appears to be that the code generation tools are able to generate valid\ncode 9 out of 10 times. In the generated code, some issues like syntax errors are more\nvisible to the programmer, than for example operations with incompatible types. When\nthe latter occurs in a given code, it is less unlikely that the programmer notices this issue\nsince in some instances the code can run without any errors for a given input; however,\nfail for another one. Therefore we want to highlight this particular vulnerability of the\ngenerated code by the tools.\nAll code generation tools are capable of generating valid code 9 out of 10\ntimes with mostly similar types of issues. The practitioners should expect\nthat for 10% of the time the generated code by the code generation tools\nwould be invalid. Moreover, they should test their code thoroughly to catch\nall possible cases that may cause the generated code to be invalid.\n5.2 Code Correctness (RQ1.2)\nIn our previous study, before we obtained our results, we hypothesized that code\ngeneration tools could either understand the user intent or not (Yetistiren et al., 2022).\nThis characteristic would result in a correct or incorrect code for a given problem.\nHowever, like our previous study, here as well; in contrast to a binary scenario\nfor code correctness where the generated solution is either correct or incorrect, code\ngeneration tools also generated partially correct solutions. As shown in Figure 6, for\n23.2% of the problems, GitHub Copilot generated partially correct code and in Figure\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n19\ndef\ncompare_one(a, b):\n\"\"\"\nCreate a function\nthat\ntakes\nintegers , floats , or\nstrings\nrepresenting\nreal\nnumbers , and\nreturns\nthe\nlarger\nvariable\nin\nits\ngiven\nvariable\ntype.

This\nis the case because usually in regular programming practices, it is seen that the first\niteration made on the written code is not correct. Still, over the next iterations, the code\nbecomes correct. Therefore, we argue that GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer,\nand ChatGPT are considerably successful in understanding user intent and generating\nthe correct code. Our standpoint is further elaborated on with an example in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\nFor example, in Listing 7, we give an example of partially correctly generated code\nby ChatGPT. The generated code by ChatGPT defines the bounds and the increment\n20\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\ndef\nstrange_sort_list (lst):\n\u2019\u2019\u2019\nGiven\nlist of integers , return\nlist in\nstrange\norder.

The code correctness score for this approach is 20%. However,\nif we change the bounds and the increment of the same for loop as shown in (2), the\ncode correctness score increases to 100%. In Listing 8, we present the code generated for\nproblem #54. The return statement marked with (1) is the Amazon CodeWhisperer\u2019s\ngeneration. This solution to the problem has a 57% code correctness score. The return\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n21\nFig. 13 Distribution of Correctly Generated Samples among the Code Generation Tools\nstatement marked with (2) is the correct approach for the solution to the problem. Such\nexamples show that, even with minor additional input from the programmer, the code\ncorrectness scores can be improved. We have only provided two examples for Amazon\nCodeWhisperer and ChatGPT; however, the examples for each code generation tool\ncan be diversified including GitHub Copilot.\ndef\nis_palindrome (string: str) -> bool:\n\"\"\"\nTest if given\nstring is a palindrome\n\"\"\"\nreturn\nstring == string [:: -1]\ndef\nmake_palindrome (string: str) -> str:\n\"\"\"\nFind\nthe\nshortest\npalindrome\nthat\nbegins\nwith a supplied\nstring.\nAlgorithm\nidea is simple:\n- Find\nthe\nlongest\npostfix\nof\nsupplied\nstring\nthat is a\npalindrome.\n- Append to the end of the\nstring\nreverse\nof a string\nprefix\nthat\ncomes\nbefore\nthe\npalindromic\nsuffix.\n\"\"\"\nif not\nstring:\nreturn\n\u2019\u2019\n(1) for i in range(len(string), 0,\n-1):\n(2) for i in range (0, len(string), 1):\nif\nis_palindrome (string[i:]):\nreturn\nstring + string [:i][:: -1]\nListing 7 Partially Correct Code Generation by ChatGPT (ID: 10)\nIn Listing 9, we exemplify our other finding about the code generation tools we have\nevaluated.

As it can be seen the prompt for the \u201ccommon\" function is more\nstraightforward, whereas the prompt for the \u201cminPath\" function is more complicated.\nSuch characteristics of these prompts are reflected in the code generation performance\nof GitHub Copilot; for the first function, a correct solution is generated, and for the\nlatter one GitHub Copilot failed to generate any algorithm. Similar to our previous\nfinding, this tendency can also be generalized to all of the code generation tools that\nwe evaluated.\nTo discuss the comparative code generation success of GitHub Copilot, Amazon\nCodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT, we created Figure 13. The Venn diagram in this figure\nshows us the correct code generation capabilities of the code generation tools more in-\ndepth, in comparison to the mere percentage values.

Additionally, we\nhave found that the generated solutions for longer and more complex prompts\nfor the functions yielded lower Code Correctness scores, in contrast to the\nfunctions that had simpler instructions contained in the prompt. For indi-\nvidual Code Correctness performances of the code generation tools, we have\nfound that ChatGPT was the most successful and Amazon CodeWhisperer\nwas the least successful tool. Practitioners that will potentially employ these\ntools should await similar results for the correctness of their code generated\nby these code generation tools.\n24\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\n5.3 Code Security & Code Reliability & Code Maintainability (RQ1.3 & RQ1.4 &\nRQ1.5)\nCode Security: As explained in Section 4.3, we have seen no difference between\nthe generators in terms of Code Security. Moreover, the security rating of all of the\nproblems for each generator had the maximum rating, therefore per our results and our\nbenchmark dataset, we can say that the generators are equally successful in terms of\ngenerating secure code.\nCode Reliability: Our Code Reliability results were represented by the number of\nbugs observed in each sample, the severity of these particular bugs, and the estimated\ntime to solve them. In Figures 14 one of the bugs can be observed. The cause of this\nbug is the inconsistent usage of the \u2018if\u2019 statement, that the same expression is written\nunder different conditions. The other bugs (Problem #37 and #100) we have found\nfor GitHub Copilot have the same cause as the previous problem. In Figure 15, the\nonly bug we found by SonarQube for Amazon CodeWhisperer is shown. The cause of\nthis bug is the single iteration of a \u2018while\u2019 loop. The bugs for ChatGPT can be seen in\nFigures 16 and 17. One of these bugs was caused by the wrong indentation usage for\nthe \u2018return\u2019 statement and the other one was caused by the regular expression, that the\n\u02c6character has higher precedence and the expression would be anchored upon.\nThe vulnerabilities therefore should be taken into account by the potential users of\nthe code generation tools, and they might reflect some of the weaknesses of the code\ngenerators and be showing one of the possible directions of improvement. As we have\nargued, the generators have unique bugs, and the bugs do not correspond to the gener-\nated solution for the same problem by other generators. Therefore, we cannot prove\nthe superiority of a given generator to another regarding its reliable code generation\ncapabilities. From another perspective, regarding the estimated time to eliminate the\nbugs, we have seen that the most successful candidate was Amazon CodeWhisperer\nwith 5 minutes on average, and the least successful candidate was GitHub Copilot, with\n15 minutes. The average estimated time to eliminate the bugs contained in the code\ngenerated by ChatGPT was 12.5 minutes. While from this perspective, there appears\nto be a ranking among the code generation tools, we believe that considering our\nprevious point too, a conclusion regarding the bug-free code generation capabilities of\nthese tools should not be made solely relying on the estimated time to eliminate the bugs.\nCode Maintainability: During our evaluation, we have seen some code smells among\nall the generators, varying in severity and resulting in a considerable amount of Techni-\ncal Debt. The exact results were shown in Table 2 and explained in Section 4.3. The\nthree most common issues were, improper naming of the function or variable, and high\ncognitive complexities.\nIn Figure 18, the instances of the code with high cognitive complexity and improper\nnaming of variables can be seen. This particular example was generated by GitHub\nCopilot; however, the smells in this code were also seen in some of the code generated\nby Amazon CodeWhisperer and ChatGPT. Figure 19 shows the other most common\ntype of smell, which is the improper naming of the function. There is also an additional\nsmell, which is the improper naming of a variable, which is named after a reserved word\nin Python. The naming of the function is found to be improper by SonarQube since it\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n25\nFig. 14 GitHub Copilot v1.70.8099 Bug in Problem #33\nFig. 15 Amazon CodeWhisperer Jan \u201923 Bug in Problem #102\nadopted the camel case approach, which should have been the Snake Case approach for\nPython.\nIn general, we have seen that our findings for Code Maintainability of the generated code\nby GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT, where we have seen some\nshortcomings were the most noteworthy ones. For Code Security and Code Reliability\nmetrics, we did not find significant results, which we could generalize to all the code\ngenerators, or show a given generator was performing better than the others. However,\nwe could generalize the Code Maintainability results; they allowed us to list all of the\ncode smells we observed using our benchmark dataset. Most importantly, apart from\nsome smells, we could see them in the code generated by all of the generators.\nCode that contains some bugs should be excepted by the practitioners of\nGitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT. However, per our\nresults, they are not as common as the code smells, which we have observed\nfor all code generators. Practicioners should note that if their code contains\nsome smells, the average time to solve them is 9.1 minutes for GitHub Copilot,\n5.6 minutes for Amazon CodeWhisperer, and 8.9 minutes for ChatGPT. In\nterms of Code Security, our results showed that the practitioners should await\nto get secure code from the generators.\n26\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nFig. 16 ChatGPT 9 Jan \u201923 version Bug in Problem #8\nFig. 17 ChatGPT 9 Jan \u201923 version Bug in Problem #141\nFig. 18 GitHub Copilot v1.70.8099 Smells (3) in Problem #106\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n27\nFig. 19 ChatGPT 9 Jan \u201923 version Smells (2) in Problem #66\nFig. 20 Code Correctness Score Distribution of the Problems for Different Experiments -\nGitHub Copilot v1.70.8099\n5.4 Using only Function Names and Parameters Without Prompt (RQ2)\nAccording to the results presented in Section 4.4, we observed a significant drop in\nboth the code validity and code correctness metrics. For example, the code validity\ndropped by 13.5% for GitHub Copilot, 12.2% for Amazon CodeWhisperer, and 16.5%\nfor ChatGPT after the docstrings were removed from the problems. Similarly, the\ncode correctness score dropped by 26.2%, 16.5%, and 43.2% respectively. These results\nreflected a general performance drop affecting the validity and the correctness of the\ncode. From this, we argue that the code generation performance of code generation\ntools correlates with the input explanation. In Figures 20, 21, and 22 the distribution\n28\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nFig. 21 Code Correctness Score Distribution of the Problems for Different Experiments -\nAmazon CodeWhisperer Jan \u201923\nFig. 22 Code Correctness Score Distribution of the Problems for Different Experiments -\nChatGPT 9 Jan \u201923 Version\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n29\nfor the code correctness scores of the code generation tools are visualized. Through\nthese distributions, it is trivial to discern that the correct code generation capabilities\nof the tools tend to be affected negatively. This is demonstrated by the cumulation of\nproblems on the lower half part of the distributions, and the dropped mean and median\nvalues. From this, we argue that the lack of a proper explanation of the problems yields\nlower validity and correctness scores. Therefore, in practical usage, practitioners should\npay attention to providing instructions for the code they tend to write to the tools.\nThere were some cases, where we did not see any decrease in correctness or validity\nscores. For GitHub Copilot, such problems constituted 82.3% of the dataset for code\nvalidity and 45.1% for code correctness. For Amazon CodeWhisperer, in 84.1% of the\nproblems for code validity and 63.4% for code correctness, we did not observe a decrease.\nFor ChatGPT, the scores did not decrease for 78.7% of the dataset for code validity\nand 51.2% for code correctness. We have seen such cases mostly for problems that\ninclude substring search, value manipulations in an array, and character comparison.\nAdditionally, the names of such functions, accompanied by parameter names were\nself-explanatory, which means that GitHub Copilot could still make interpretations\nabout the function without requiring more details.\nFor the cases where the code correctness and validity scores dropped, we observed\nthat these problems were more complicated. When we examined where the success\nrate of code generation tools dropped, we observed cases where the function name and\nthe parameters alone failed to give details. This means that the name and parameters\nalone are not informative enough to give details about such functions. For example,\nin one case, a function called \u201cwill_it_fly\u201d only has two parameters called \u2018q\u2019 and\n\u2018w\u2019. Amazon CodeWhisperer and ChatGPT generated the correct code in our original\nexperiment where we used the function name and prompt but after removing the\nfunction explanation from the input, they were not able to generate valid code. To be\nmore precise, ChatGPT could not generate any code at all. The purpose of the function\nwas to check if \u2018q\u2019 was a palindromic list and if the sum of the elements in the list was\nless than \u2018w\u2019. The generations of Amazon CodeWhisperer with and without prompt\ncan be seen in Listing 10.\nWhen using code generation tools, it is crucial to provide clear and accurate\nproblem descriptions to obtain valid and correct code. Whenever possible,\nprogrammers should include a comprehensive explanation of the problem,\nalong with sample unit tests in the form of docstrings, comments, or other\nforms of documentation during the solution generation process.\n5.5 Using Dummy Function Names (RQ3)\nAccording to the results in Section 4.5, we did not observe a dramatic change in the\ncode validity scores, while there was a drop in the code correctness scores. For example,\nthe code validity increased by 2.4% for GitHub Copilot and dropped by 0.6% for\nAmazon CodeWhisperer and ChatGPT after the function names became \u2018foo\u2019. The code\ncorrectness score dropped by 4.2%, 3.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. These results reflected\na general performance affecting the validity did not change much but it dropped for the\ncorrectness of the code. From this, we argue that the code generation performance of\ncode generation tools correlates with the input explanation. Figures 20, 21, and 22 show\nour point visually as well. However, as one may notice, the change in the distributions,\n30\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\n1 # Code\ngeneration\nof\nAmazon\nCodeWhisperer\nwith\nprompt\n2 def\nwill_it_fly(q,w):\n3\n\u2019\u2019\u2019\n4\nWrite a function\nthat\nreturns\nTrue if the\nobject q will fly , and\nFalse\notherwise.

Hence, we argue that while providing the proper function\nnames is crucial itself, the effect of not providing a proper explanation is more drastic.\nAccording to the majority of our results, the absence of clear and descriptive function\nnames is one of the primary causes of the decline in code correctness and average code\ncorrectness. To illustrate, as shown in Listing 11, in problem #79 it is asked to convert\nthe given decimal number to binary and add \u2018db\u2019 to both the start and end of the string\nand return it. In the original experiment, its name was \u2018decimal_to_binary\u2019, which\nis a highly descriptive name considering the purpose of the function. Hence, Amazon\nCodeWhisperer resulted in 100% correctness in the original setup. When we eliminated\nthe function name, we observed that the solution to the problem converted to an invalid\none. On the other hand, GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT successfully solved this problem\nin both setups. When we considered problem #1, it asked to separate the parenthesis\ngroups given in one string. The method should find the nested groups and separate\nthem. The function\u2019s name was \u2018separate_paren_groups\u2019 in the original setup and it\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n31\n1 def\ndecimal_to_binary (decimal):\n2\n\"\"\" You\nwill be given a number in\ndecimal\nform\nand\nyour\ntask is\nto\nconvert\nit to binary\nformat.

While ChatGPT had 100% correctness in the original setup,\nit resulted in 0% correctness in the dummy function name setup, which suggests the\nimportance of the proper function name for the code generation tools.\nConsidering the results given in Table 4, even though the code validity scores are\nclose, the code correctness scores decreased. It can be concluded that changing the\nmeaningful function names with dummy function names reduced the performance of\nCopilot for most of the problems. It can be stated that generally changing meaningful\nfunction names to dummy function names affects the performance of GitHub Copilot\nnegatively compared to the original experiment where we use both meaningful function\nnames and prompts.\nSelecting a meaningful name for a function can significantly improve the\nperformance of code generation tools in generating accurate code. It is\nimportant for practitioners to assign clear and descriptive names to functions.\nHowever, our findings suggest that providing thorough explanations for\nfunctions is even more critical than giving them meaningful names. Ideally,\nboth practices should be employed to produce the most accurate and valid\ncode possible.\n5.6 Evaluation of Code Generation Tools Over Time (RQ4)\nThe results mentioned in Section 4.6 demonstrate that both GitHub Copilot and Amazon\nCodeWhisperer increased the number of correct code suggestions on their new versions.\nAs it can be observed from Figure 23 and 25, GitHub Copilot v1.70.8099 had passed\nsuggestions for 46.3% unit tests and average correctness for 59.9% of all problems,\nwhile GitHub Copilot v1.7.4421 had passed suggestions for 28.7% the unit tests and\naverage correctness for 53.6% of all problems.

We also noticed that 9 out of the 33 incorrect answers from the previous\nversion of GitHub Copilot were better in the new version.

In the new version of GitHub Copilot, we observed that although its suggestion\nwas generally very similar to the previous one, it placed the swapping expression in the\ncorrect location in the function and this modification caused an increase in correctness\nfrom 75% to 100%.\nAdditionally, we performed a comparison of the outcomes between the two different\nAmazon CodeWhisperer versions. According to our research, 50% of the partly correct\nsuggestions made by the prior version of Amazon CodeWhisperer were made more\ncorrectly by the new version. In addition, we discovered that 46 out of the 74 incorrect\nsuggestions made by the prior version of Amazon CodeWhisperer were made correctly\nby the new version. In most cases where the new version of Amazon CodeWhisperer\nimproved upon the previous version, we observed that the previous version frequently\nreturned default values such as empty list, zero, false, or empty string. Although these\nrecommendations sometimes produced correct results with some unit tests, they resulted\nin a low rate of partial correctness. With the updated Amazon CodeWhisperer, this\nproblem was largely resolved, and the updated version offered more logical and precise\nanswers.\nAdditionally, we noticed that 10 out of 14 incorrect answers from the previous\nversion of GitHub Copilot were removed in the new version. These incorrect answers\nwere typically the result of syntactical errors, excess of maximum recursion depth, or\nthe usage of modules that are not imported. For example, the Listing 14 shows that\nthe old version of GitHub Copilot recommended an unsuccessful recursion function\nwithout a base case for the problem #123, which leads to a compilation error. As a\n36\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nresult of introducing a base case to the code, the new version of GitHub Copilot was\nable to fix this error completely. As another example, while the old version of GitHub\nCopilot did not add import the \u2018reduce\u2019 module, the new version of GitHub Copilot\nrecommended a different solution without using the \u2018reduce\u2019 module, which resulted\nin 100% correctness. However, we found that almost none of the invalid suggestions\nmade by the earlier version of Amazon CodeWhisperer changed their status in the new\nversion when we analyzed the validity rate for both versions.\n1 def\nget_odd_collatz (n):\n2\n\"\"\"\n3\nGiven a positive\ninteger n, return a sorted\nlist\nthat\nhas the\nodd\nnumbers\nin\ncollatz\nsequence.

The outcomes also showed that of the 84 partial correct\nanswers in the old GitHub Copilot version, 19 of them had reduced percentages of\ncorrectness in the new GitHub Copilot version. When we examined the answers from\nthe two versions of GitHub Copilot, we found that the new version of GitHub Copilot\nfrequently recommended \u00b4pass\u2019, which reduced the correctness of the answer. We\nobserved that GitHub Copilot sometimes answered the problem nearly correctly, and\nsometimes it only answered as \u2018pass\u2019 to the same problem. These issues may be related\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n37\nto the undetermined nature of GitHub Copilot. We also noticed that some problems\nwere resolved in the previous version of GitHub Copilot with the correct solutions. Still,\nin the new version of GitHub Copilot, these problems resulted in compilation errors,\nwhich were generally because of forgetting to add an import to the modules.\nOur research also showed that while the earlier version of Amazon CodeWhisperer\noffered entirely correct suggestions, the new version provided partial or incorrect answers\nfor 16 of the 40 problems. Additionally, our research revealed that the new version of\nAmazon CodeWhisperer had reduced correctness rates for 20 of the 50 partly correct\nsolutions offered by the prior version. We noticed that the following were the main\nreasons why code recommendations in the new edition were unsuccessful: Firstly, the\ntool occasionally suggested using a pass statement only, which is an incorrect response\nto the problem at hand. Second, as was already stated, it occasionally returned default\nnumbers that did not fulfill the required solution. Thirdly, it proposed a single-line\nreturn expression that was complicated and often failed to produce correct results. For\ninstance, Listing 15 presents that problem #155 wanted the function should take a\nnumber as an input parameter, and the function should return a tuple that has the\nnumber of even and odd digits, respectively. The new Amazon CodeWhisperer version\nfor this problem produced a single-line but complicated return statement which gave\na syntactic error for negative numbers. Despite having a long solution, the previous\nversion of Amazon CodeWhisperer had an 85% correctness rate.\n1 def\neven_odd_count (num):\n2\n\"\"\" Given an\ninteger. return a tuple\nthat\nhas the\nnumber of even\nand odd\ndigits\nrespectively .\n3\nExample:\n4\neven_odd_count ( -12) ==> (1, 1)\n5\neven_odd_count (123) ==> (1, 2)\n6\n\"\"\"\n7\n8\n9\n#Result of old\nversion\nof Amazon\nCodeWhisperer\nin the\noriginal\nexperiment\n10\neven = 0\n11\nodd = 0\n12\nif num < 0:\n13\nnum = -num\n14\nwhile\nnum > 0:\n15\nif num % 2 == 0:\n16\neven += 1\n17\nelse:\n18\nodd += 1\n19\nnum = num // 10\n20\nreturn\neven , odd\n21\n22\n#Result of new\nversion\nof Amazon\nCodeWhisperer\nin the\noriginal\nexperiment\n23\nreturn (len ([i for i in str(num) if int(i)%2==0]) , len ([i for i\nin str(num) if int(i)%2]))\nListing 15 Generated Code for the Example Problem (ID: 155)\n38\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nGitHub Copilot\u2019s new version had 62% more passed-unit tests than its older\nversion. Similarly, Amazon CodeWhisperer\u2019s updated version resulted in 28%\nmore passed-unit tests than its previous version, suggesting that both tools\nhave notable improvements.\n6 Threats to Validity\n6.1 Conclusion Validity\nTrivial Solutions: In some problems, code generators generated solutions to return\nsimple statements like empty arrays or Boolean values. In this case, if there are test\ncases related to the problem, where such expressions are the desired output, those test\ncases pass by chance without any algorithm generated for the problem.\nNumber of test cases: The varying amount of test cases for the dataset may introduce\na threat to our experiment. On average there are 7.7 test cases for each problem in the\nHumanEval dataset Chen et al. (2021). Having broader test cases, both for the amount\nand the scope can be important. By extending the test cases, any potential corner case\nthat could be missed may be covered. This can be critical especially when some corner\ncases for a given problem are not involved. We plan to improve the test cases both in\nquantity and quality in our future work.\nSonarQube: We used the SonarQube code inspector to obtain results for our code\nsecurity, code maintainability, and code reliability metrics. But in our results for them,\nthere was scarce information about the possible vulnerabilities for the generated code\nin each sample, which would be discovered by SonarQube. We believe that due to the\nextent of the problems that are contained in the HumanEval Dataset, the solutions to\nthose problems consist of a small number of lines. The case could also be observed in\nthe canonical solutions provided with each question.\n6.2 Internal Validity\nOne-shot code generation: While generating code with the code generators, we used\nthe function names, parameters, the corresponding docstring containing an explanation\nof the function, and a few instances of tests for that function. Furthermore, we did not\nwrite any code to provide additional information to the code generators which would\nclarify more what our intent for that particular problem is. Therefore, in most cases,\nthe success rate could be increased if we have given hints as code snippets to the code\ngenerators.\nReproduction of the Generations: While conducting our experiments, we observed\nthat the code generators had a nondeterministic characteristic, hence they were gener-\nating different outputs for the same input in different trials. We paid great attention\nnot to include different outputs for the same input by generating code for our problems\nin one iteration, and saving the generated code, then conducting our evaluation on\nthe saved code. Given that the code generators have a dynamic characteristic that the\nunderlying LLM of the tools is being retrained, our results might not be fully replicated\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n39\ngiven our experimental setup and input.\nCode Generation Methods: With GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer,\none can use two different approaches to generate code. For GitHub Copilot, the first\none happens automatically as a programmer proceeds to write code, GitHub Copi-\nlot suggests code snippets that might fit into that context. In the other approach,\nwhenever the programmer wants to generate code, they press the \u2018ctrl + enter\u2019 key\ncombination to see up to 10 code generations GitHub Copilot produces. Similar to\nGitHub Copilot, the default approach for Amazon CodeWhisperer is also automatically\ngenerating code when prompted. The other approach in Amazon CodeWhisperer is\nto use the \u2018option + c\u2019 (Mac) / \u2018alt + c\u2019 (PC) key combination. In our experiment,\nwe chose the first approach whenever possible, otherwise, we implemented the second\napproach and selected the suggestion at the top of the list. There were some problems\nwhere the generators failed to generate any code after we entered the next line (af-\nter the user presses the \u2018enter\u2019 key and continues from the next line). Therefore, we\nhad to apply the key combinations to see the solutions, and we were able to obtain\ncode generations for all problems. As we had to use two different methods for code\ngeneration, we stated our practice as a possible factor to reduce the validity of our study.\nOn a further note, we also want to state the difference between the solutions that are\nautomatically generated, and the ones shown when the key combinations are applied.\nWe observed that for the same context, two methods yield different results. There-\nfore, if in both methods, the code is generated, choosing different methods for a set\nof problems may introduce possible invalidity to a study. Hence, we tried to be as\nconsistent as possible in our experiment by avoiding the latter method whenever possible.\nBlock and Line-by-Line Generation: For GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhis-\nperer, for most of the cases, they managed to generate the solution of a given function\nas bulk, but there were cases, where we had to generate the solution line-by-line. As\nwe had no control over how these tools would generate the code, we had to accept\nthe method they would choose for a particular problem. We state these cases, as in\nline-by-line suggestion, the previously generated lines might have an effect on the next\nline to be generated, whereas in the first case, code is generated at once as a bulk. We\nhave not experienced this problem with ChatGPT, since it always generated the whole\nfunction in a single interaction.\nVersions of the Generators: While conducting our experiment, the latest version of\nGitHub Copilot was v1.70.8099 and of ChatGPT was 9 Jan \u201923. As explained earlier,\nAmazon does not keep the version of their CodeWhisperer, therefore we can only provide\nthe time when we conducted our experiment, which was January 2023. For any possible\nlater evaluations with the same experimental setup, the results might be different, which\nwe have proved with RQ4.\nInterval for Improvement of the Code Generators: As mentioned in Section 3.6,\nwe have made duplicate experiments on GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer\nto evaluate how these tools have improved over time, in terms of code correctness.\nHowever, the intervals between the two experiments for each generator are not the\nsame. In other words, the time difference between the experiments we conducted for\nGitHub Copilot was 13 months; however, this difference was two months for Amazon\n40\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nCodeWhisperer. Hence, the room for improvement for these tools is not the same.\nPrompting ChatGPT: GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer are tools that\nare integrated into an IDE. Therefore when we provided input to these tools, the tools\ngenerated code directly. However, we had to give an explanation to ChatGPT that\nour inputs should be used to generate code. We explained in a the following sentence\n\u201cGenerate code using the prompts I will provide\" to ChatGPT for code generation.\nThen we inputted the prompts one-by-one in the same chat window.\n6.3 Construct Validity\nMetrics: As explained in Section 3.3, we have evaluated the generated code using the\nCode Validity, Correctness, Security, Maintainability, and Reliability metrics. However,\nwe are aware that we could have used additional metrics, such as Readability, Cyclomatic\nComplexity, and Reusability to analyze the generated code.\n6.4 External Validity\nProblem Coverage: For our experiment, we evaluated the generated solutions for 164\ndifferent problems, contained in the HumanEval dataset. In the HumanEval dataset,\nthe subjects of the problems include algorithms, simple mathematics, reasoning, and\nlanguage comprehension Chen et al. (2021). For better and more insightful results, the\nnumber of problems can be increased, and the comprehension of the problems could be\nbroader. For instance, in the experimental setup proposed by Xu et al. (2022) for their\ncode generation and retrieval tool, the scope of the problems consists of basic Python,\nfile, OS, web scraping, web server & client, data analysis & ML, and data visualization.\nSuch topics could be included in our dataset to both broaden the comprehension and\nincrease the number of our problems. We consider this task as future work for our study.\nDependency on the HumanEval Dataset: As we explained in Section 3.1, we have\nused the HumanEval Benchmark Dataset for our experiment. Since we have only used\nthis dataset, it followed that we were limited to the Python programming language.\nHence, our experiment can reflect the code generation performance of the generators in\nregard to this language.\nIDE Dependency: For code generation using GitHub Copilot and Amazon Code-\nWhisperer, we used the Visual Studio Code IDE. In Table 1, we show the available\nIDEs that these tools are available on. Since we tried the code generation only on a\nsingle IDE, there might be IDE-dependent results; using the other mentioned IDEs\nmight have yielded different results.\n7 Related Work\nIn the last few years, code generation has attracted attention from researchers such as\nZhong et al. (2022); Hayati et al. (2018); Sun et al. (2020); Lyu et al. (2021). In this\nstudy, we compare some of the prevalent code generators: GitHub Copilot, Amazon\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n41\nCodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT, concerning their code generation capabilities, and find\nthe strengths and shortcomings of the tools by looking at the code quality metrics: Code\nValidity, Code Correctness, Code Reliability, Code Security, and Code Maintainability.\nWhen we investigated the studies similar to ours, we found more related studies about\nGitHub Copilot than other AI-based code generation tools. The reason is that GitHub\nCopilot was the first created tool among the code generators we evaluated and there\nwas more time for it to be evaluated by researchers.\nThe underlying model of GitHub Copilot, Codex, is externally developed by OpenAI\nand employed by GitHub. Some earlier versions of the current Codex model used by\nGitHub Copilot were evaluated by Chen et al. (2021). The Codex model relies on GPT\nmodels that OpenAI previously developed for natural language generation. The public\ncode available on GitHub was used here while fine-tuning the model to implement the\ncode recognition and generation capabilities. This model can recognize other elements\nsuch as function signatures, code comments, etc. and it can use such elements as inputs\nand generate related outputs. They found that a success rate of 70.2% could be reached\nin terms of code correctness, by generating 100 solutions for each problem and choosing\nthe most successful one among them. The success rate was only 28.8% for the case\nwith one solution per problem, which is consistent with our initial results in Yetistiren\net al. (2022). In this research, we also examined code reliability, maintainability, and\nsecurity to provide a detailed form of this evaluation. We evaluated the three main code-\ngeneration tools as well. Additionally, in order to broaden the scope of our investigation,\nwe modified the HumanEval dataset by replacing real function names with the dummy\nname \u2018foo\u2019 and then produced new sets of results.\nThere are also empirical studies similar to ours, conducted to evaluate GitHub\nCopilot. We list the available studies in the following.\nOne such study is conducted by Sobania et al. (2022) in which the code correctness\nof GitHub Copilot is evaluated, and the tool is contrasted to the automatic program\ngenerators having the Genetic Programming (GP) architecture. They found that there\nis not a significant difference between the two approaches on the benchmark problems;\nhowever, the program synthesis approaches are not sufficient in supporting programmers\ncompared to GitHub Copilot.\nAn evaluation of GitHub Copilot in terms of the security of the generated programs\nwas implemented by Pearce et al. (2021). They evaluated the vulnerabilities in the\ncode generated by Copilot. It was determined that 40% of generated programs were\nvulnerable. These results differed from our Code Security results; we believe that the\ncharacteristics of our dataset caused the difference between the two studies.\nAnother study discusses the effects of GitHub Copilot by conducting a within-\nsubjects user study Vaithilingam et al. (2022). It was found that GitHub Copilot did\nnot cause a significant improvement in terms of speed and success rate. However, it\nwas stated that most participants preferred to use Copilot in daily programming tasks\nsince it saved the effort for the basic tasks.\nNguyen and Nadi (2022) evaluated GitHub Copilot using 33 different LeetCode\nquestions and four different programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, and C).\nTheir evaluation includes code correctness and code understandability for the generated\ncode. They evaluated code correctness by measuring the ratio of passed tests for each\nquestion, which is a similar approach to our study. Code understandability was measured\nby two different metrics, which are cognitive and cyclomatic complexity. In terms of\ncode correctness, Java had the highest (57%) and JavaScript had the lowest (27%) score.\n42\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nFor code understandability, they determined that there was no statistical significance\nbetween the programming languages.\nMastropaolo et al. (2023) presented an empirical study that focuses on the effect of\nsemantic-preserving changes in the natural language on the generated code function of\nGitHub Copilot. For this purpose, Mastropaolo et al. (2023) provided 892 non-trivial\nJava method descriptions to GitHub Copilot. Firstly, they used the original descriptions\nof methods and asked GitHub Copilot to generate them. Secondly, they paraphrased\ndescriptions manually. Thirdly, they paraphrased descriptions using automated para-\nphrasing tools. After GitHub Copilot generated all of the methods according to their\ndescriptions, they found that in 46% of cases, semantically equivalent but different\nmethod descriptions resulted in different code recommendations. Moreover, they ob-\nserved that some code recommendations were correct with only one of the semantically\nequivalent descriptions as input.\nChatGPT is the other code generator that we have chosen for our study. Since\nChatGPT is released recently, there are only a few studies similar to our work. These\nstudies are in the following.\nIn order to analyze the bug fixing performance of ChatGPT, Sobania et al. (2023)\nevaluated ChatGPT on the standard bug fixing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compared\nthese results with CoCoNut, Codex, and standard APR approaches. They found that\nChatGPT had a similar performance to Codex and its performance was much better\nthan standard APR approaches. When Sobania et al. (2023) used the dialogue option\nof ChatGPT and gave ChatGPT more information about the bug, they found that\nChatGPT gave an overall success rate of 77.5%. Then, they concluded that although\nChatGPT had an outstanding performance, it required mental cost to verify ChatGPT\nanswers.\nThe possible integration of ChatGPT into a well-known software testing curriculum\nis covered in another research. Jalil et al. (2023) requested that ChatGPT respond to\ntypical software testing questions. They discovered that ChatGPT could offer correct or\npartly correct responses in 44% of the cases and correct or partially correct explanations\nof answers in 57% of the cases. As a result, they noticed that ChatGPT failed a course\non software testing. Furthermore, ChatGPT was a poor judge of its correctness. It is\ntherefore uncertain how much benefit ChatGPT might offer to students.\nAdditionally, we have selected Amazon CodeWhisperer as the code generation tool\nfor our study\u2019s evaluation. There are no studies about Amazon CodeWhisperer that\nare comparable to our research because it is a relatively new tool, like the case with\nChatGPT.\nIn general, most of the associated works assessed the code quality produced by\nGitHub Copilot or OpenAI\u2019s Codex model. Except for the studies of Pearce et al. (2021),\nwhere the emphasis is code security, and Vaithilingam et al. (2022), where the work\nprimarily focuses on the practical usage performance of GitHub Copilot, the majority\nof the studies concentrated on the assessment of code correctness. On the other hand,\nthere aren\u2019t nearly enough studies about ChatGPT and Amazon CodeWhisperer that\nare comparable to ours. The bug-fixing performance of ChatGPT (Sobania et al., 2023)\nand the possible applicability of ChatGPT to a well-known software testing program\n(Jalil et al., 2023) were the main topics of related research about ChatGPT that we\ndiscovered.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing code correctness,\ncode validity, security, maintainability, and dependability between GitHub Copilot,\nAmazon CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT. In this regard, we think that our methods and\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n43\nfindings will contribute to current research on the capabilities of these common tools\nand other code-generation tools.\n8 Conclusion\nIn our study, we compared three code generation tools: GitHub Copilot, Amazon\nCodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT. We evaluated the quality of the generated code in\nterms of correctness, validity, reliability, security, and maintainability. Our results show\nthat ChatGPT, in its original setup, had the highest success rate among the evaluated\ncode generation tools. Specifically, it was able to generate correct code solutions for\n65.2% of the problems in the HumanEval problem dataset. It also produced partially\ncorrect solutions for 22.6% of the problems and incorrect solutions for 12.2% of the\nproblems.\nIn terms of code maintainability, we found repeated types of code smells among the\ncode generation tools, and we compiled a list of the code smells that we encountered. If\nthe solution to the problem contained any smells, the average time to eliminate them\nwas 9.1 minutes for GitHub Copilot, 5.6 minutes for Amazon CodeWhisperer, and 8.9\nminutes for ChatGPT.\nTo evaluate the impact of input parameters\u2019 quality on the three major code\ngeneration tools, we conducted an assessment of providing only function names and\nparameters. Our findings revealed that compared to their initial setup, all three code-\ngeneration tools had lower percentages of correct answers. ChatGPT and GitHub\nCopilot achieved the best and most comparable outcomes, with correct answers for\n20%-22% of the problems, partially correct answers for 26%-27% of the problems, and\nincorrect answers for 50%-53% of the problems.\nWe also investigated the effect of dummy function names on the success of code\ngeneration tools. Our results showed that ChatGPT had the highest percentage of\ncorrect solutions among the three tools, with 61.6% of the problems examined generating\ncorrect solutions. ChatGPT also generated partially correct solutions for 25.6% of the\nproblems and incorrect solutions for 12.8% of the problems.\nBased on our findings, ChatGPT was the most successful tool, whereas Amazon\nCodeWhisperer was the least successful. We also found that providing an accurate and\nclear problem description was essential for the success of code generation tools, as we\nobserved that all tools performed worse when we eliminated docstrings from the input.\nMoreover, we observed that both Amazon CodeWhisperer and GitHub Copilot are\nimproving rapidly, suggesting their potential for various coding tasks in the future.\nIn summary, our study has made several contributions to the understanding of code\ngeneration tools:\n\u2013 We conducted a comparative analysis of GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer,\nand ChatGPT and provided a comprehensive comparison table (Table 1) of their\nfeatures.\n\u2013 We evaluated the code generation capabilities of these tools using the HumanEval\ndataset and proposed a pipeline to assess the quality of the generated code.\n\u2013 We analyzed the performance improvements of the new version of GitHub Copi-\nlot compared to the previous version and observed the improvement of Amazon\nCodeWhisperer between November 2022 and January 2023.\n\u2013 We highlighted the importance of providing accurate and clear problem descriptions\nfor code generation tools to improve their performance.\n44\nBurak Yeti\u015ftiren et al.\nOverall, our study contributes to the development of code generation tools and\nprovides insights into their potential for various coding tasks in the future.\nData Availability: Our data yielded from this study and the code that was utilized\ncan be found in our repository at https://github.com/mirayayerdem/Github-Copilot-\nAmazon-Whisperer-ChatGPT.\nConflict of Interests: The authors declare no conflicts of interest in relation to this\narticle.\nReferences\nBays\nJ\n(2022)\nAws\nannounces\namazon\ncodewhisperer\n(preview).\nURL\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/06/\naws-announces-amazon-codewhisperer-preview/\nCerullo M (2023) Chatgpt is growing faster than tiktok.

As the\ndevelopment of deep learning and arti\ufb01cial intelligence, neural network-based\nTTS has signi\ufb01cantly improved the quality of synthesized speech in recent years.\nIn this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on neural TTS, aiming to\nprovide a good understanding of current research and future trends. We focus\non the key components in neural TTS, including text analysis, acoustic models,\nand vocoders, and several advanced topics, including fast TTS, low-resource\nTTS, robust TTS, expressive TTS, and adaptive TTS, etc. We further summarize\nresources related to TTS (e.g., datasets, opensource implementations) and discuss\nfuture research directions. This survey can serve both academic researchers and\nindustry practitioners working on TTS.\n1\nIntroduction\nText to speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, which aims to synthesize intelligible and\nnatural speech from text [346], has broad applications in human communication [1] and has long\nbeen a research topic in arti\ufb01cial intelligence, natural language and speech processing [296, 228, 147].\nDeveloping a TTS system requires knowledge about languages and human speech production, and in-\nvolves multiple disciplines including linguistics [63], acoustics [170], digital signal processing [320],\nand machine learning [25, 146].\nAs the development of deep learning [183, 89], neural network-based TTS has thrived, and a large\namount of research work comes out focusing on different aspects of neural TTS [426, 254, 382, 303,\n150, 270, 192, 290]. Consequently, the quality of synthesized speech has been largely improved in\nrecent years. Understanding the current research status and \ufb01guring out unsolved research problems\nare very helpful for people working on TTS. While there are multiple survey papers on statistical\nparametric speech synthesis [27, 425, 357, 422] and neural TTS [331, 226, 306, 248, 118, 260, 242],\na comprehensive survey on the basics and the recent developments of neural TTS is still necessary\nsince the topics in this area are diverse and evolve quickly. In this paper, we conduct a deep and\ncomprehensive survey on neural TTS2 3.\nIn the following subsections, we \ufb01rst brie\ufb02y review the history of TTS technologies, then introduce\nsome basic knowledge of neural TTS, and \ufb01nally outline this survey.\n\u2217Corresponding author: Xu Tan, xuta@microsoft.com\n2This survey paper is originated from our TTS tutorials, including TTS tutorial at ISCSLP 2021 (https:\n//tts-tutorial.github.io/iscslp2021/) and TTS tutorial at IJCAI 2021 (https://tts-tutorial.g\nithub.io/ijcai2021/).\n3Readers can use this Github page (https://github.com/tts-tutorial/survey) to check updates and\ninitiate discussions on this survey paper.\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2106.15561v3  [eess.AS]  23 Jul 2021\n1.1\nHistory of TTS Technology\nPeople have tried to build machines to synthesize human speech dating back to the 12th century [388].\nIn the 2nd half of the 18th century, the Hungarian scientist, Wolfgang von Kempelen, had constructed\na speaking machine with a series of bellows, springs, bagpipes and resonance boxes to produce\nsome simple words and short sentences [72]. The \ufb01rst speech synthesis system that built upon\ncomputer came out in the latter half of the 20th century [388]. The early computer-based speech\nsynthesis methods include articulatory synthesis [53, 300], formant synthesis [299, 5, 171, 172], and\nconcatenative synthesis [253, 241, 297, 127, 26]. Later, as the development of statistics machine\nlearning, statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) is proposed [416, 356, 425, 357], which\npredicts parameters such as spectrum, fundamental frequency and duration for speech synthesis.\nFrom 2010s, neural network-based speech synthesis [426, 284, 78, 424, 375, 191, 254, 382] has\ngradually become the dominant methods and achieved much better voice quality.\nArticulatory Synthesis\nArticulatory synthesis [53, 300] produces speech by simulating the behav-\nior of human articulator such as lips, tongue, glottis and moving vocal tract. Ideally, articulatory\nsynthesis can be the most effective method for speech synthesis since it is the way how human gener-\nates speech. However, it is very dif\ufb01cult to model these articulator behaviors in practice. For example,\nit is hard to collect the data for articulator simulation. Therefore, the speech quality by articulatory\nsynthesis is usually worse than that by later formant synthesis and concatenative synthesis.\nFormant Synthesis\nFormant synthesis [299, 5, 171] produces speech based on a set of rules that\ncontrol a simpli\ufb01ed source-\ufb01lter model. These rules are usually developed by linguists to mimic\nthe formant structure and other spectral properties of speech as closely as possible. The speech\nis synthesized by an additive synthesis module and an acoustic model with varying parameters\nlike fundamental frequency, voicing, and noise levels. The formant synthesis can produce highly\nintelligible speech with moderate computation resources that are well-suited for embedded systems,\nand does not rely on large-scale human speech corpus as in concatenative synthesis. However, the\nsynthesized speech sounds less natural and has artifacts. Moreover, it is dif\ufb01cult to specify rules for\nsynthesis.\nConcatenative Synthesis\nConcatenative synthesis [253, 241, 297, 127, 26] relies on the concate-\nnation of pieces of speech that are stored in a database. Usually, the database consists of speech\nunits ranging from whole sentence to syllables that are recorded by voice actors. In inference,\nthe concatenative TTS system searches speech units to match the given input text, and produces\nspeech waveform by concatenating these units together. Generally speaking, concatenative TTS can\ngenerate audio with high intelligibility and authentic timbre close to the original voice actor. However,\nconcatenative TTS requires huge recording database in order to cover all possible combinations of\nspeech units for spoken words. Another drawback is that the generated voice is less natural and\nemotional, since concatenation can result in less smoothness in stress, emotion, prosody, etc.\nStatistical Parametric Synthesis\nTo address the drawbacks of concatenative TTS, statistical para-\nmetric speech synthesis (SPSS) is proposed [416, 356, 415, 425, 357]. The basic idea is that instead\nof direct generating waveform through concatenation, we can \ufb01rst generate the acoustic parame-\nters [82, 355, 156] that are necessary to produce speech and then recover speech from the generated\nacoustic parameters using some algorithms [132, 131, 155, 238]. SPSS usually consists of three\ncomponents: a text analysis module, a parameter prediction module (acoustic model), and a vocoder\nanalysis/synthesis module (vocoder). The text analysis module \ufb01rst processes the text, including\ntext normalization [317], grapheme-to-phoneme conversion [24], word segmentation, etc, and then\nextracts the linguistic features, such as phonemes, duration and POS tags from different granularities.\nThe acoustic models (e.g., hidden Markov model (HMM) based) are trained with the paired linguistic\nfeatures and parameters (acoustic features), where the acoustic features include fundamental fre-\nquency, spectrum or cepstrum [82, 355], etc, and are extracted from the speech through vocoder\nanalysis [132, 155, 238]. The vocoders synthesize speech from the predicted acoustic features. SPSS\nhas several advantages over previous TTS systems: 1) naturalness, the audio is more natural; 2)\n\ufb02exibility, it is convenient to modify the parameters to control the generate speech; 3) low data cost,\nit requires less recordings than concatenative synthesis. However, SPSS also has its drawbacks: 1)\nthe generated speech has lower intelligibility due to artifacts such as muf\ufb02ed, buzzing or noisy audio;\n2) the generated voice is still robotic and can be easily differentiated from human recording speech.\n2\nIn near 2010s, as neural network and deep learning have achieved rapid progress, some works \ufb01rst\nintroduce deep neural network into SPSS, such as deep neural network (DNN) based [426, 284]\nand recurrent neural network (RNN) based [78, 422, 424]. However, these models replace HMM\nwith neural networks and still predict the acoustic features from linguistic features, which follow\nthe paradigm of SPSS. Later, Wang et al. [375] propose to directly generate acoustic features from\nphoneme sequence instead of linguistic features, which can be regarded as the \ufb01rst exploration for\nend-to-end4 speech synthesis. In this survey, we focus on neural based speech synthesis, and mostly\non end-to-end models. Since later SPSS also uses neural networks as the acoustic models, we brie\ufb02y\ndescribe these models but do not dive deep into the details.\nAcoustic Model\nVocoder\nWaveform\nAcoustic \nFeatures\nText\nText Analysis\nLinguistic \nFeatures\nFigure 1: The three key components in neural TTS.\nNeural Speech Synthesis\nAs the development of deep learning, neural network-based TTS (neural\nTTS for short) is proposed, which adopts (deep) neural networks as the model backbone for speech\nsynthesis. Some early neural models are adopted in SPSS to replace HMM for acoustic modeling.\nLater, WaveNet [254] is proposed to directly generate waveform from linguistic features, which\ncan be regarded as the \ufb01rst modern neural TTS model. Other models like DeepVoice 1/2 [8, 87]\nstill follow the three components in statistical parametric synthesis, but upgrade them with the\ncorresponding neural network based models. Furthermore, some end-to-end models (e.g., Tacotron\n1/2 [382, 303], Deep Voice 3 [270], and FastSpeech 1/2 [290, 292]) are proposed to simplify text\nanalysis modules and directly take character/phoneme sequences as input, and simplify acoustic\nfeatures with mel-spectrograms. Later, fully end-to-end TTS systems are developed to directly\ngenerate waveform from text, such as ClariNet [269], FastSpeech 2s [292] and EATS [69]. Compared\nto previous TTS systems based on concatenative synthesis and statistical parametric synthesis, the\nadvantages of neural network based speech synthesis include high voice quality in terms of both\nintelligibility and naturalness, and less requirement on human preprocessing and feature development.\n1.2\nOrganization of This Survey\nIn this paper, we mainly review research works on neural TTS, which consists of two parts, as shown\nin Figure 2.\nKey Components in TTS\nA modern TTS system consists of three basic components5: a text\nanalysis module, an acoustic model, and a vocoder. As shown in Figure 1, the text analysis module\nconverts a text sequence into linguistic features, the acoustic models generate acoustic features from\nlinguistic features, and then the vocoders synthesize waveform from acoustic features. We review\nthe research on the three components of neural TTS in Section 2. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01rst introduce\nthe main taxonomy for the basic components of neural TTS in Section 2.1, and then introduce the\nworks on text analysis, acoustic models, and vocoders in Section 2.2, Section 2.3, and Section 2.4\nrespectively. We further introduce the research towards fully end-to-end TTS in Section 2.5. Although\nwe mainly review the research works according to the taxonomy of key components in neural TTS,\nwe also describe several other taxonomies, including the way of sequence generation (autoregressive\nor non-autoregressive), different generative models, and different network structures in Section 2.6.\nBesides, we also illustrate the time evolution of some representative TTS works in Section 2.6.\n4The term \u201cend-to-end\u201d in TTS has a vague meaning. In early studies, \u201cend-to-end\u201d refers to that the\ntext-to-spectrogram model is end-to-end, but still uses a separate waveform synthesizer (vocoder). It can also\nbroadly refer to the neural based TTS models which do not use complicated linguistic or acoustic features. For\nexample, WaveNet [254] does not use acoustic features but directly generate waveform from linguistic features,\nand Tacotron [382] does not use linguistic features but directly generate spectrogram from character or phoneme.\nHowever, the strict end-to-end model refers to directly generating waveform from text. Therefore, in this paper\nwe use \u201cend-to-end\u201d, \u201cmore end-to-end\u201d and \u201cfully end-to-end\u201d to differentiate the degree of end-to-end for TTS\nmodels.\n5Although some end-to-end models do not explicitly use text analysis (e.g., Tacotron 2 [303]), acoustic\nmodels (e.g., WaveNet [254]), or vocoders (e.g., Tacotron [382], and some systems only use a single end-to-end\nmodel (e.g., FastSpeech 2s [292]), using these components are still popular in current TTS research and product.\n3\nTTS Survey\nSec. 2: Key Components in TTS\nSec. 2.1: Main Taxonomy\nSec. 2.2: Text Analysis\nSec. 2.3: Acoustic Model\nSec. 2.4: Vocoder\nSec. 2.5: Towards Fully E2E TTS\nSec. 2.6: Other Taxonomies\nSec. 3: Advanced Topics in TTS\nSec. 3.1: Background and Taxonomy\nSec. 3.2: Fast TTS\nSec. 3.3: Low-Resource TTS\nSec. 3.4: Robust TTS\nSec. 3.5: Expressive TTS\nSec. 3.6: Adaptive TTS\nFigure 2: Organization of this survey paper.\nAdvanced Topics in TTS\nBesides the key components of neural TTS, we further review several\nadvanced topics in neural TTS, which push the frontier of TTS research and address practical\nchallenges in TTS product. For example, as TTS is a typical sequence to sequence generation task\nand the output sequence is usually very long, how to speed up the autoregressive generation and\nreduce the model size for fast speech synthesis are hot research topics (Section 3.2). A good TTS\nsystem should generate both natural and intelligible speech and a lot of TTS research works aim\nto improve the intelligibility and naturalness of speech synthesis. For example, in low-resource\nscenarios where the data to train a TTS model is insuf\ufb01cient, the synthesized speech may be of both\nlow intelligibility and naturalness. Therefore, a lot of works aim to build data-ef\ufb01cient TTS models\nunder low-resource settings (Section 3.3). Since TTS models are facing robustness issues where\nword skipping and repeating problems in generated speech affect the speech quality, a lot of works\naim to improve the robustness of speech synthesis (Section 3.4). To improve the naturalness and\nexpressiveness, a lot of works model, control, and transfer the style/prosody of speech in order to\ngenerate expressive speech (Section 3.5). Adapting a TTS model to support the voice of any target\nspeakers is very helpful for the broad usage of TTS. Therefore, ef\ufb01cient voice adaptation with limited\nadaptation data and parameters is critical for practical TTS applications (Section 3.6).\nTo further enrich this survey, we summarize TTS related resources including open-source implemen-\ntations, corpora, and other useful resources in Section 4. We summarize this survey and discuss future\nresearch directions in Section 5.\n2\nKey Components in TTS\nIn this section, we review the research works from the perspective of the key components (text\nanalysis, acoustic models, and vocoders) in neural TTS. We \ufb01rst introduce the main taxonomy\nunder this perspective in Section 2.1, and then introduce the three TTS components in Section 2.2,\nSection 2.3, and Section 2.4, respectively. Furthermore, we review the works towards fully end-to-\nend TTS in Section 2.5. Besides the main taxonomy, we also introduce more taxonomies such as\nautoregressive/non-autoregressive sequence generation, generative model, network structure, as well\nas the timeline of representative research works on TTS in Section 2.6.\n4\nTTS\nText Analysis\nChar\u2192Linguistic\nTN [316, 229, 437], G2P [410, 326, 327]\nProsody Prediction [318, 140, 283, 257]\nUni\ufb01ed Model [258, 444]\nDeepVoice 1/2 [8, 87]\nAcoustic Model\nLinguistic\u2192Acoustic\nHMM-based [416, 356, 415, 357]\nDNN based [426, 284]\nRNN based [78, 422], Emphasis [191]\nChar/Phone\u2192Acoustic\nARST [375], DeepVoice 3 [270]\nTacotron 1/2 [382, 303], DurIAN [418]\nFastSpeech 1/2 [290, 292], DCTTS [332]\nTransformerTTS [192], VoiceLoop [333]\nParaNet [268], Glow-TTS [159]\nGrad-TTS [276], PriorGrad [185]\nVocoder\nVocoder in SPSS\nSTRAIGHT [155], WORLD [238]\nLinguistic\u2192Wav\nWaveNet [254], Par.WaveNet [255]\nWaveRNN [150], GAN-TTS [23]\nAcoustic\u2192Wav\nLPCNet [363], WaveGlow [279]\nFloWaveNet [163], MelGAN [178]\nPar.WaveGAN [255], HiFi-GAN [174]\nDiffWave [176], WaveGrad [41]\nFully E2E Model\nChar/Phone\u2192Wav\nChar2Wav [315], FastSpeech 2s [292]\nClariNet [269], EATS [69], VITS [160]\nWave-Tacotron [385], Ef\ufb01cientTTS [235]\n(a) A taxonomy of neural TTS.\nCharacter\nPhoneme\nLinguistic Features\nWaveform\nLSP/MCC/MGC+F0+BAP\nBFCC\nMelS\nLinS\nTN + G2P\nTN + WordSeg + POS + Prosody+ G2P\nTacotron 2\nDeepVoice 3\nTransformerTTS \nFastSpeech 1/2\nTacotron\nHMM/DNN based SPSS\nARST \nLPCNet\nGriffin-Lim\nChar2Wav  \nClariNet \nFastSpeech 2s\nEATS\nWave-Tacotron\nEfficientTTS\nVITS\nWaveNet\nPar.WaveNet\nWaveRNN\nGAN-TTS\nSTRAIGHT\nWORLD\nWaveGlow\nFloWaveNet\nMelGAN\nPar.WaveGAN\nHiFi-GAN\nDiffWave\nWaveGrad\nText\nLinguistic\nFeatures\nAcoustic\nFeatures\nWaveform\n(b) The data \ufb02ows from text to waveform.\nFigure 3: A taxonomy of neural TTS from the perspectives of key components and data \ufb02ows.\n5\n2.1\nMain Taxonomy\nWe categorize the works on neural TTS mainly from the perspective of basic TTS components:\ntext analysis, acoustic models, vocoders6, and fully end-to-end models, as shown in Figure 3a. We\n\ufb01nd this taxonomy is consistent with the data conversion \ufb02ow from text to waveform: 1) Text\nanalysis converts character into phoneme or linguistic features; 2) Acoustic models generate acoustic\nfeatures, from either linguistic features or characters/phonemes; 3) Vocoders generate waveform\nfrom either linguistic features or acoustic features; 4) Fully end-to-end models directly convert\ncharacters/phonemes into waveform.\nWe re-organize the TTS works according to the data \ufb02ow from text to waveform, as shown in\nFigure 3b. There are several data representations in the process of text to speech conversion: 1)\nCharacters, which are the raw format of text. 2) Linguistic features, which are obtained through text\nanalysis and contain rich context information about pronunciation and prosody. Phonemes are one\nof the most important elements in linguistic features, and are usually used alone to represent text\nin neural based TTS models. 3) Acoustic features, which are abstractive representations of speech\nwaveform. In statistical parametric speech synthesis [416, 356, 415, 425, 357], LSP (line spectral\npairs) [135], MCC (mel-cepstral coef\ufb01cients) [82], MGC (mel-generalized coef\ufb01cients) [355], F0\nand BAP (band aperiodicities) [156, 157] are used as acoustic features, which can be easily converted\ninto waveform through vocoders such as STRAIGHT [155] and WORLD [238]. In neural based end-\nto-end TTS models, mel-spectrograms or linear-spectrograms are usually used as acoustic features,\nwhich are converted into waveform using neural based vocoders. 4) Waveform, the \ufb01nal format of\nspeech. As can be seen from Figure 3b, there can be different data \ufb02ows from text to waveform,\nincluding: 1) character \u2192linguistic features \u2192acoustic features \u2192waveform; 2) character \u2192\nphoneme \u2192acoustic features \u2192waveform; 3) character \u2192linguistic features \u2192waveform; 4)\ncharacter \u2192phoneme \u2192acoustic features \u2192waveform; 5) character \u2192phoneme \u2192waveform, or\ncharacter \u2192waveform.\n2.2\nText Analysis\nText analysis, also called frontend in TTS, transforms input text into linguistic features that contain\nrich information about pronunciation and prosody to ease the speech synthesis. In statistic parametric\nsynthesis, text analysis is used to extract a sequence of linguistic feature vectors [357], and contains\nseveral functionalities such as text normalization [316, 439], word segmentation [400], part-of-speech\n(POS) tagging [298], prosody prediction [51], and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion [410]. In\nend-to-end neural TTS, due to the large modeling capacity of neural based models, the character or\nphoneme sequences are directly taken as input for synthesis, and thus the text analysis module is\nlargely simpli\ufb01ed. In this scenario, text normalization is still needed to get standard word format\nfrom character input, and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is further needed to get phonemes\nfrom standard word format. Although some TTS models claim fully end-to-end synthesis that\ndirectly generates waveform from text, text normalization is still needed to handle raw text with any\npossible non-standard formats for practical usage. Besides, some end-to-end TTS models incorporate\nconventional text analysis functions. For example, Char2Wav [315] and DeepVoice 1/2 [8, 87]\nimplement the character-to-linguistic feature conversion into its pipeline, purely based on neural\nnetworks, and some works[321] explicitly predict prosody features with text encoder. In the remaining\nof this subsection, we \ufb01rst introduce the typical tasks for text analysis in statistic parametric synthesis,\nand then discuss the development of text analysis in end-to-end TTS models.\nWe summarize some typical tasks in text analysis in Table 1, and introduce some representative works\nfor each task as follows.\n\u2022 Text normalization. The raw written text (non-standard words) should be converted into spoken-\nform words through text normalization, which can make the words easy to pronounce for TTS\nmodels. For example, the year \u201c1989\u201d is normalized into \u201cnineteen eighty nine\u201d, \u201cJan. 24\u201d is\nnormalized into \u201cJanunary twenty-fourth\u201d. Early works on text normalization are rule based [317],\n6Note that some neural TTS models such as WaveNet [254] and WaveRNN [150] are \ufb01rst introduced\nto directly generate waveform from linguistic features. From this perspective, WaveNet can be regarded as\na combination of an acoustic model and a vocoder. Following works usually leverage WaveNet and Wav-\neRNN as a vocoder by taking mel-spectrograms as input to generate waveform. Therefore, we categorize\nWaveNet/WaveRNN into vocoders and introduce in Section 2.4.\n6\nTable 1: Typical tasks in text analysis (i.e., TTS fronend, character\u2192linguistic).\nTask\nResearch Work\nText Normalization\nRule-based [317], Neural-based [316, 229, 413, 437], Hybrid [439]\nWord Segmentation\n[400, 451, 267]\nPOS Tagging\n[298, 329, 227, 451, 138]\nProsody Prediction\n[51, 412, 318, 190, 140, 328, 283, 64, 447, 216, 218, 3]\nGrapheme to Phoneme\nN-gram [42, 24], Neural-based [410, 289, 33, 326]\n- - Polyphone Disambiguation\n[448, 398, 230, 301, 327, 29, 263]\nand then neural networks are leveraged to model text normalization as a sequence to sequence\ntask where the source and target sequences are non-standard words and spoken-form words\nrespectively [316, 229, 437]. Recently, some works [439] propose to combine the advantages of\nboth rule-based and neural-based models to further improve the performance of text normalization.\n\u2022 Word segmentation. For character-based languages such as Chinese, word segmentation [400, 451,\n267] is necessary to detect the word boundary from raw text, which is important to ensure the\naccuracy for later POS tagging, prosody prediction, and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion process.\n\u2022 Part-of-speech tagging. The part-of-speech (POS) of each word, such as noun, verb, preposition, is\nalso important for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and prosody prediction in TTS. Several works\nhave investigated POS tagging in speech synthesis [298, 329, 227, 451, 138].\n\u2022 Prosody prediction. The prosody information, such as rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech,\ncorresponds to the variations in syllable duration, loudness and pitch, which plays an important\nperceptual role in human speech communication. Prosody prediction relies on tagging systems\nto label each kind of prosody. Different languages have different prosody tagging systems and\ntools [307, 294, 345, 112, 249]. For English, ToBI (tones and break indices) [307, 294] is a popular\ntagging system, which describes the tags for tones (e.g., pitch accents, phrase accents, and boundary\ntones) and break (how strong the break is between words). For example, in this sentence \u201cMary\nwent to the store ?\u201d, \u201cMary\u201d and \u201cstore\u201d can be emphasized, and this sentence is raising tone. A\nlot of works [318, 190, 140, 283] investigate different models and features to predict the prosody\ntags based on ToBI. For Chinese speech synthesis, the typical prosody boundary labels consist of\nprosodic word (PW), prosodic phrase (PPH) and intonational phrase (IPH), which can construct\na three-layer hierarchical prosody tree [51, 328, 64]. Some works [51, 3, 64, 328, 216, 218]\ninvestigate different model structures such as CRF [180], RNN [114], and self-attention [368] for\nprosody prediction in Chinese.\n\u2022 Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion. Converting character (grapheme) into pronunciation\n(phoneme) can greatly ease speech synthesis. For example, the word \u201cspeech\u201d is converted into \u201cs\np iy ch\u201d. A manually collected grapheme-to-phoneme lexicon is usually leveraged for conversion.\nHowever, for alphabetic languages like English, lexicon cannot cover the pronunciations of all the\nwords. Thus, the G2P conversion for English is mainly responsible to generate the pronunciations\nof out-of-vocabulary words [42, 24, 410, 289, 33, 326]. For languages like Chinese, although the\nlexicon can cover nearly all the characters, there are a lot of polyphones that can be only decided\naccording to the context of a character7. Thus, G2P conversion in this kind of languages is mainly\nresponsible for polyphone disambiguation, which decides the appropriate pronunciation based on\nthe current word context [448, 398, 230, 301, 327, 29, 263].\nAfter the above text analyses, we can further construct linguistic features and take them as input to\nthe later part of TTS pipeline, e.g., acoustic models in SPSS or vocoders [254]. Usually, we can\nconstruct linguistic features by aggregating the results of text analysis from different levels including\nphoneme, syllable, word, phrase and sentence levels [357].\nDiscussions\nAlthough text analysis seems to receive less attention in neural TTS compared to\nSPSS, it has been incorporated into neural TTS in various ways: 1) Multi-task and uni\ufb01ed frontend\nmodel. Recently, Pan et al. [258], Zhang et al. [444] design uni\ufb01ed models to cover all the tasks\nin text analysis in a multi-task paradigm and achieve good results. 2) Prosody prediction. Prosody\n7A lot of languages including English have polyphones. For example, \u201cresume\u201d in English can be pronounced\nas \u201cri\u2032zju:m\u2032\u201d (means to go on or continue after interruption) or \u201c\u2032rezjumei\u201d (means curriculum vitae).\n7\nis critical for the naturalness of speech synthesis. Although neural TTS models simplify the text\nanalysis module, some features for prosody prediction are incorporated into text encoder, such as the\nprediction of pitch [292], duration [290], phrase break [206], breath or \ufb01lled pauses [404] are built\non top of the text (character or phoneme) encoder in TTS models. Some other ways to incorporate\nprosody features include 1) reference encoders that learn the prosody representations from reference\nspeech; 2) text pre-training that learns good text representations with implicit prosody information\nthrough self-supervised pre-training [104, 98]; and 3) incorporating syntax information through\ndedicated modeling methods such as graph networks [208].\n2.3\nAcoustic Models\nIn this section, we review the works on acoustic models, which generate acoustic features from\nlinguistic features or directly from phonemes or characters. As the development of TTS, different\nkinds of acoustic models have been adopted, including the early HMM and DNN based models in\nstatistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) [416, 356, 426, 284, 78, 424], and then the sequence\nto sequence models based on encoder-attention-decoder framework (including LSTM, CNN and self-\nattention) [382, 303, 270, 192], and the latest feed-forward networks (CNN or self-attention) [290,\n268] for parallel generation.\nAcoustic models aim to generate acoustic features that are further converted into waveform using\nvocoders. The choice of acoustic features largely determines the types of TTS pipeline. Different\nkinds of acoustic features have been tried, such as mel-cepstral coef\ufb01cients (MCC) [82], mel-\ngeneralized coef\ufb01cients (MGC) [355], band aperiodicity (BAP) [156, 157], fundamental frequency\n(F0), voiced/unvoiced (V/UV), bark-frequency cepstral coef\ufb01cients (BFCC), and the most widely\nused mel-spectrograms. Accordingly, we can divide the acoustic models into two periods: 1) acoustic\nmodels in SPSS, which typically predict acoustic features such as MGC, BAP and F0 from linguistic\nfeatures, and 2) acoustic models in neural based end-to-end TTS, which predict acoustic features\nsuch as mel-spectrograms from phonemes or characters.\n2.3.1\nAcoustic Models in SPSS\nIn SPSS [425, 357], statistical models such as HMM [416, 356], DNN [426, 284] or RNN [78, 424]\nare leveraged to generate acoustic features (speech parameters) from linguistic features, where\nthe generated speech parameters are converted into speech waveform using a vocoder such as\nSTRAIGHT [155] and WORLD [238]. The developments of these acoustic models are driven by\nseveral considerations: 1) taking more context information as input; 2) modeling the correlation\nbetween output frames; 3) better combating the over-smoothing prediction problem [425], since the\nmapping from linguistic features to acoustic features is one-to-many. We brie\ufb02y review some works\nas follows.\nHMM [286] is leveraged to generate speech parameters in Yoshimura et al. [416], Tokuda et al.\n[356], where the observation vectors of HMM consist of spectral parameter vectors such as mel-\ncepstral coef\ufb01cients (MCC) and F0. Compared to previous concatenative speech synthesis, HMM-\nbased parametric synthesis is more \ufb02exible in changing speaker identities, emotions, and speaking\nstyles [356]. Readers can refer to Zen [422], Zen et al. [425], Tokuda et al. [357] for some analyses\non the advantages and drawbacks of HMM-based SPSS. One major drawback of HMM-based SPSS\nis that the quality of the synthesized speech is not good enough [425, 357], mainly due to two\nreasons: 1) the accuracy of acoustic models is not good, and the predicted acoustic features are over-\nsmoothing and lack of details, and 2) the vocoding techniques are not good enough. The \ufb01rst reason\nis mainly due to the lack of modeling capacity in HMM. Thus, DNN-based acoustic models [426] are\nproposed in SPSS, which improve the synthesized quality of HMM-based models. Later, in order\nto better model the long time span contextual effect in a speech utterance, LSTM-based recurrent\nneural networks [78] are leveraged to better model the context dependency. As the development\nof deep learning, some advanced network structure such as CBHG [382] are leveraged to better\npredict acoustic features [191]. VoiceLoop [333] adopts a working memory called phonological\nloop to generate acoustic features (e.g., F0, MGC, BAP) from phoneme sequence, and then uses a\nWORLD [238] vocoder to synthesize waveform from this acoustic features. Yang et al. [409] leverage\nGAN [90] to improve the generation quality of acoustic features. Wang et al. [375] explore a more\nend-to-end way that leverages an attention-based recurrent sequence transducer model to directly\ngenerate acoustic features from phoneme sequence, which can avoid the frame-by-frame alignments\n8\nrequired in previous neural network-based acoustic models. Wang et al. [379] conduct thorough\nexperimental studies on different acoustic models. Some acoustic models in SPSS are summarized in\nTable 2.\nTable 2: A list of acoustic models and their corresponding characteristics. \u201cLing\u201d stands for linguis-\ntic features, \u201cCh\u201d stands for character, \u201cPh\u201d stands for phoneme, \u201cMCC\u201d stands for mel-cepstral\ncoef\ufb01cients [82], \u201cMGC\u201d stands for mel-generalized coef\ufb01cients [355], \u201cBAP\u201d stands for band aperi-\nodicities [156, 157], \u201cLSP\u201d stands for line spectral pairs [135], \u201cLinS\u201d stands for linear-spectrograms,\nand \u201cMelS\u201d stands for mel-spectrograms. \u201cNAR*\u201d means the model uses autoregressive structures\nupon non-autoregressive structures and is not fully parallel.\nAcoustic Model\nInput\u2192Output\nAR/NAR\nModeling\nStructure\nHMM-based [416, 356]\nLing\u2192MCC+F0\n/\n/\nHMM\nDNN-based [426]\nLing\u2192MCC+BAP+F0\nNAR\n/\nDNN\nLSTM-based [78]\nLing\u2192LSP+F0\nAR\n/\nRNN\nEMPHASIS [191]\nLing\u2192LinS+CAP+F0\nAR\n/\nHybrid\nARST [375]\nPh\u2192LSP+BAP+F0\nAR\nSeq2Seq\nRNN\nVoiceLoop [333]\nPh\u2192MGC+BAP+F0\nAR\n/\nhybrid\nTacotron [382]\nCh\u2192LinS\nAR\nSeq2Seq\nHybrid/RNN\nTacotron 2 [303]\nCh\u2192MelS\nAR\nSeq2Seq\nRNN\nDurIAN [418]\nPh\u2192MelS\nAR\nSeq2Seq\nRNN\nNon-Att Tacotron [304]\nPh\u2192MelS\nAR\n/\nHybrid/CNN/RNN\nPara.

In the following paragraphs, we introduce some representative acoustic models in\nneural TTS8, and provide a comprehensive list of acoustic models in Table 2.\nRNN-based Models (e.g., Tacotron Series)\nTacotron [382] leverages an encoder-attention-\ndecoder framework and takes characters as input9 and outputs linear-spectrograms, and uses Grif\ufb01n-\nLim algorithm [95] to generate waveform. Tacotron 2 [303] is proposed to generate mel-spectrograms\nand convert mel-spectrograms into waveform using an additional WaveNet [254] model. Tacotron 2\ngreatly improves the voice quality over previous methods including concatenative TTS, parametric\nTTS, neural TTS such as Tacotron.\nLater, a lot of works improve Tacotron from different aspects: 1) Using a reference encoder and\nstyle tokens to enhance the expressiveness of speech synthesis, such as GST-Tacotron [383] and\nRef-Tacotron [309]. 2) Removing the attention mechanism in Tacotron, and instead using a duration\npredictor for autoregressive prediction, such as DurIAN [418] and Non-attentative Tacotron [304]. 3)\nChanging the autoregressive generation in Tacotron to non-autoregressive generation, such as Parallel\nTacotron 1/2 [74, 75]. 4) Building end-to-end text-to-waveform models based on Tacotron, such as\nWave-Tacotron [385].\nCNN-based Models (e.g., DeepVoice Series)\nDeepVoice [8] is actually an SPSS system enhanced\nwith convolutional neural networks. After obtaining linguistic features through neural networks,\nDeepVoice leverages a WaveNet [254] based vocoder to generate waveform. DeepVoice 2 [87]\nfollows the basic data conversion \ufb02ow of DeepVoice and enhances DeepVoice with improved\nnetwork structures and multi-speaker modeling. Furthermore, DeepVoice 2 also adopts a Tacotron +\nWaveNet model pipeline, which \ufb01rst generates linear-spectrograms using Tacotron and then generates\nwaveform using WaveNet. DeepVoice 3 [270] leverage a fully-convolutional network structure for\nspeech synthesis, which generates mel-spectrograms from characters and can scale up to real-word\nmulti-speaker datasets. DeepVoice 3 improves over previous DeepVoice 1/2 systems by using a more\ncompact sequence-to-sequence model and directly predicting mel-spectrograms instead of complex\nlinguistic features.\nLater, ClariNet [269] is proposed to generate waveform from text in a fully end-to-end way.\nParaNet [268] is a fully convolutional based non-autoregressive model that can speed up the mel-\nspectrogram generation and obtain reasonably good speech quality. DCTTS [332] shares similar\ndata conversion pipeline with Tacotron, and leverages a fully convolutional based encoder-attention-\ndecoder network to generate mel-spectrograms from character sequence. It then uses a spectrogram\nsuper-resolution network to obtain linear-spectrograms, and synthesizes waveform using Grif\ufb01n-\nLim [95].\nTransformer-based Models (e.g., FastSpeech Series)\nTransformerTTS [192] leverages Trans-\nformer [368] based encoder-attention-decoder architecture to generate mel-spectrograms from\n8We mainly review the acoustic models according to different network structures such as RNN, CNN\nand Transformer (self-attention), while review the vocoders according to different generative models such as\nautoregressive-based, \ufb02ow-based, GAN-based, Diffusion-based, as shown in Section 2.4. However, it is not\nthe only perspective, since acoustic models also cover different generative models while vocoders also cover\ndifferent network structures.\n9Although either characters or phonemes are taken as input in neural TTS, we do not explicitly differentiate\nthem mainly for two considerations: 1) To ensure high pronunciation accuracy for product usage, phonemes are\nnecessary especially for those languages (e.g., Chinese) where graphemes and phonemes have large difference.\n2) For the models directly taking characters as input, there is no speci\ufb01c design for characters input, and thus one\ncan easily change characters into phonemes. It is worth to mention that there are some works [270, 268, 154]\nusing mixed representations of characters and phonemes as input to address the data sparsity problem.\n10\nphonemes. They argue that RNN-based encoder-attention-decoder models like Tacotron 2 suffer from\nthe following two issues: 1) Due to the recurrent nature, both the RNN-based encoder and decoder\ncannot be trained in parallel, and the RNN-based encoder cannot be parallel in inference, which\naffects the ef\ufb01ciency both in training and inference. 2) Since the text and speech sequences are usually\nvery long, RNN is not good at modeling the long dependency in these sequences. TransformerTTS\nadopts the basic model structure of Transformer and absorbs some designs from Tacotron 2 such as\ndecoder pre-net/post-net and stop token prediction. It achieves similar voice quality with Tacotron\n2 but enjoys faster training time. However, compared with RNN-based models such as Tacotron\nthat leverage stable attention mechanisms such as location-sensitive attention, the encoder-decoder\nattentions in Transformer are not robust due to parallel computation. Thus, some works propose to\nenhance the robustness of Transformer-based acoustic models. For example, MultiSpeech [39] im-\nproves the robustness of the attention mechanism through encoder normalization, decoder bottleneck,\nand diagonal attention constraint, and RobuTrans [194] leverages duration prediction to enhance the\nrobustness in autoregressive generation.\nPrevious neural-based acoustic models such as Tacotron 1/2 [382, 303], DeepVoice 3 [270] and\nTransformerTTS [192] all adopt autoregressive generation, which suffer from several issues: 1)\nSlow inference speed. The autoregressive mel-spectrogram generation is slow especially for long\nspeech sequence (e.g., for 1 second speech, there are nearly 500 frames of mel-spectrogram if hop\nsize is 10ms, which is a long sequence). 2) Robust issues. The generated speech usually has a\nlot of word skipping and repeating and issues, which is mainly caused by the inaccurate attention\nalignments between text and mel-spectrograms in encoder-attention-decoder based autoregressive\ngeneration. Thus, FastSpeech [290] is proposed to solve these issues: 1) It adopts a feed-forward\nTransformer network to generate mel-spectrograms in parallel, which can greatly speed up inference.\n2) It removes the attention mechanism between text and speech to avoid word skipping and repeating\nissues and improve robustness. Instead, it uses a length regulator to bridge the length mismatch\nbetween the phoneme and mel-spectrogram sequences. The length regulator leverages a duration\npredictor to predict the duration of each phoneme and expands the phoneme hidden sequence\naccording to the phoneme duration, where the expanded phoneme hidden sequence can match the\nlength of mel-spectrogram sequence and facilitate the parallel generation. FastSpeech enjoys several\nadvantages [290]: 1) extremely fast inference speed (e.g., 270x inference speedup on mel-spectrogram\ngeneration, 38x speedup on waveform generation); 2) robust speech synthesis without word skipping\nand repeating issues; and 3) on par voice quality with previous autoregressive models. FastSpeech\nhas been deployed in Microsoft Azure Text to Speech Service10 to support all the languages and\nlocales in Azure TTS11.\nFastSpeech leverages an explicit duration predictor to expand the phoneme hidden sequence to match\nto the length of mel-spectrograms. How to get the duration label to train the duration predictor is\ncritical for the prosody and quality of generated voice. We brie\ufb02y review the TTS models with\nduration prediction in Section 3.4.2. In the next, we introduce some other improvements based on\nFastSpeech. FastSpeech 2 [292] is proposed to further enhance FastSpeech, mainly from two aspects:\n1) Using ground-truth mel-spectrograms as training targets, instead of distilled mel-spectrograms from\nan autoregressive teacher model. This simpli\ufb01es the two-stage teacher-student distillation pipeline\nin FastSpeech and also avoids the information loss in target mel-spectrograms after distillation. 2)\nProviding more variance information such as pitch, duration, and energy as decoder input, which eases\nthe one-to-many mapping problem [139, 84, 382, 456] in text to speech12. FastSpeech 2 achieves\nbetter voice quality than FastSpeech and maintains the advantages of fast, robust, and controllable\nspeech synthesis in FastSpeech13. FastPitch [181] improves FastSpeech by using pitch information\nas decoder input, which shares similar idea of variance predictor in FastSpeech 2.\nOther Acoustic Models (e.g., Flow, GAN, VAE, Diffusion)\nBesides the above acoustic models,\nthere are a lot of other acoustic models [367, 22, 126, 187, 55], as shown in Table 2. Flow-based\nmodels have long been used in neural TTS. After the early successful applications on vocoders (e.g.,\n10https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/\n11https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/neural-text-to-speech-extends-support-to-15-more-\nlanguages-with/ba-p/1505911\n12One-to-many mapping in TTS refers to that there are multiple possible speech sequences corresponding to a\ntext sequence due to variations in speech, such as pitch, duration, sound volume, and prosody, etc.\n13FastSpeech 2s [292] is proposed together with FastSpeech 2. Since it is a fully end-to-end text-to-waveform\nmodel, we introduce it in Section 2.5.\n11\nParallel WaveNet [255], WaveGlow [279], FloWaveNet [163]), \ufb02ow-based models are also applied\nin acoustic models, such as Flowtron [366] that is an autoregressive \ufb02ow-based mel-spectrogram\ngeneration model, Flow-TTS [234] and Glow-TTS [159] that leverage generative \ufb02ow for non-\nautoregressive mel-spectrogram generation. Besides \ufb02ow-based models, other generative models have\nalso been leveraged in acoustic models. For example, 1) GMVAE-Tacotron [119], VAE-TTS [443],\nand BVAE-TTS [187] are based on VAE [168]; 2) GAN exposure [99], TTS-Stylization [224],\nand Multi-SpectroGAN [186] are based on GAN [90]; 3) Diff-TTS [141], Grad-TTS [276], and\nPriorGrad [185] are based on diffusion model [310, 113].\nTable 3: A list of vocoders and their corresponding characteristics.\nVocoder\nInput\nAR/NAR\nModeling\nArchitecture\nWaveNet [254]\nLinguistic Feature\nAR\n/\nCNN\nSampleRNN [233]\n/\nAR\n/\nRNN\nWaveRNN [150]\nLinguistic Feature\nAR\n/\nRNN\nLPCNet [363]\nBFCC\nAR\n/\nRNN\nUniv.

Some popular vocoders in SPSS include STRAIGHT [155] and\nWORLD [238]. We take the WORLD vocoder as an example, which consists of vocoder analysis\nand vocoder synthesis steps. In vocoder analysis, it analyzes the speech and gets acoustic features\nsuch as mel-cepstral coef\ufb01cients [82], band aperiodicity [156, 157] and F0. In vocoder synthesis, it\ngenerates speech waveform from these acoustic features. In this section, we mainly review the works\non neural-based vocoders due to their high voice quality.\nEarly neural vocoders such as WaveNet [254, 255], Char2Wav [315], WaveRNN [150] directly take\nlinguistic features as input and generate waveform. Later, Prenger et al. [279], Kim et al. [163], Kumar\net al. [178], Yamamoto et al. [402] take mel-spectrograms as input and generate waveform. Since\nspeech waveform is very long, autoregressive waveform generation takes much inference time. Thus,\ngenerative models such as Flow [65, 169, 167], GAN [90], VAE [168], and DDPM (Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model, Diffusion for short) [310, 113] are used in waveform generation.\nAccordingly, we divide the neural vocoders into different categories: 1) Autoregressive vocoders,\n12\n2) Flow-based vocoders, 3) GAN-based vocoders, 4) VAE-based vocoders, and 5) Diffusion-based\nvocoders. We list some representative vocoders in Table 3 and describe them as follows.\nAutoregressive Vocoders\nWaveNet [254] is the \ufb01rst neural-based vocoder, which leverages dilated\nconvolution to generate waveform points autoregressively. Unlike the vocoder analysis and synthesis\nin SPSS [82, 355, 156, 135, 155, 238], WaveNet incorporates almost no prior knowledge about\naudio signals, and purely relies on end-to-end learning. The original WaveNet, as well as some\nfollowing works that leverage WaveNet as vocoder [8, 87], generate speech waveform conditioned on\nlinguistic features, while WaveNet can be easily adapted to condition on linear-spectrograms [87]\nand mel-spectrograms [336, 270, 303]. Although WaveNet achieves good voice quality, it suffers\nfrom slow inference speed. Therefore, a lot of works [256, 117, 233] investigate lightweight and fast\nvocoders. SampleRNN [233] leverages a hierarchical recurrent neural network for unconditional\nwaveform generation, and it is further integrated into Char2Wav [315] to generate waveform con-\nditioned on acoustic features. Further, WaveRNN [448] is developed for ef\ufb01cient audio synthesis,\nusing a recurrent neural network and leveraging several designs including dual softmax layer, weight\npruning, and subscaling techniques to reduce the computation. Lorenzo-Trueba et al. [215], Paul\net al. [265], Jiao et al. [144] further improve the robustness and universality of the vocoders. LPC-\nNet [363, 364] introduces conventional digital signal processing into neural networks, and uses linear\nprediction coef\ufb01cients to calculate the next waveform point while leveraging a lightweight RNN to\ncompute the residual. LPCNet generates speech waveform conditioned on BFCC (bark-frequency\ncepstral coef\ufb01cients) features, and can be easily adapted to condition on mel-spectrograms. Some\nfollowing works further improve LPCNet from different perspectives, such as reducing complexity\nfor speedup [370, 275, 151], and improving stability for better quality [129].\nFlow-based Vocoders\nNormalizing \ufb02ow [65, 66, 293, 169, 167] is a kind of generative model. It\ntransforms a probability density with a sequence of invertible mappings [293]. Since we can get\na standard/normalized probability distribution (e.g., Gaussion) through the sequence of invertible\nmappings based on the change-of-variables rules, this kind of \ufb02ow-based generative model is called\nas a normalizing \ufb02ow. During sampling, it generates data from a standard probability distribution\nthrough the inverse of these transforms. The \ufb02ow-based models used in neural TTS can be divided\ninto two categories according to the two different techniques [262]: 1) autoregressive transforms [169]\n(e.g., inverse autoregressive \ufb02ow used in Parallel WaveNet [255]), and 2) bipartite transforms (e.g.,\nGlow [167] used in WaveGlow [279], and RealNVP [66] used in FloWaveNet [163]), as shown in\nTable 4.\nTable 4: Several representative \ufb02ow-based models and their formulations [271].\nFlow\nEvaluation z = f \u22121(x)\nSynthesis x = f(z)\nAR\nAF [261]\nzt = xt \u00b7 \u03c3t(x<t; \u03b8) + \u00b5t(x<t; \u03b8)\nxt = zt\u2212ut(x<t;\u03b8)\n\u03c3t(x<t;\u03b8)\nIAF [169]\nzt = xt\u2212\u00b5t(z<t;\u03b8)\n\u03c3t(z<t;\u03b8)\nxt = zt \u00b7 \u03c3t(z<t; \u03b8) + \u00b5t(z<t; \u03b8)\nBipartite\nRealNVP [66]\nza = xa,\nxa = za,\nGlow [167]\nzb = xb \u00b7 \u03c3b(xa; \u03b8) + \u00b5b(xa; \u03b8)\nxb = zb\u2212\u00b5b(xa;\u03b8)\n\u03c3b(xa;\u03b8)\n\u2022 Autoregressive transforms, e.g., inverse autoregressive \ufb02ow (IAF) [169]. IAF can be regarded as a\ndual formulation of autoregressive \ufb02ow (AF) [261, 124]. The training of AF is parallel while the\nsampling is sequential. In contrast, the sampling in IAF is parallel while the inference for likelihood\nestimation is sequential. Parallel WaveNet [255] leverages probability density distillation to marry\nthe ef\ufb01cient sampling of IAF with the ef\ufb01cient training of AR modeling. It uses an autoregressive\nWaveNet as the teacher network to guide the training of the student network (Parallel WaveNet)\nto approximate the data likelihood. Similarly, ClariNet [269] uses IAF and teacher distillation,\nand leverages a closed-form KL divergence to simplify and stabilize the distillation process.\nAlthough Parallel Wavenet and ClariNet can generate speech in parallel, it relies on sophisticated\nteacher-student training and still requires large computation.\n\u2022 Bipartite transforms, e.g., Glow [167] or RealNVP [66]. To ensure the transforms to be invertible,\nbipartite transforms leverage the af\ufb01ne coupling layers that ensure the output can be computed from\n13\nthe input and vice versa. Some vocoders based on bipartite transforms include WaveGlow [279]\nand FloWaveNet [163], which achieve high voice quality and fast inference speed.\nBoth autoregressive and bipartite transforms have their advantages and disadvantages [271]: 1)\nAutoregressive transforms are more expressive than bipartite transforms by modeling dependency\nbetween data distribution x and standard probability distribution z, but require teacher distillation that\nis complicated in training. 2) Bipartite transforms enjoy much simpler training pipeline, but usually\nrequire larger number of parameters (e.g., deeper layers, larger hidden size) to reach comparable\ncapacities with autoregressive models. To combine the advantages of both autoregressive and bipartite\ntransforms, WaveFlow [271] provides a uni\ufb01ed view of likelihood-based models for audio data to\nexplicitly trade inference parallelism for model capacity. In this way, WaveNet, WaveGlow, and\nFloWaveNet can be regarded as special cases of WaveFlow.\nGAN-based Vocoders\nGenerative adversarial networks (GANs) [90] have been widely used in data\ngeneration tasks, such as image generation [90, 455], text generation [419], and audio generation [68].\nGAN consists a generator for data generation, and a discriminator to judge the authenticity of the\ngenerated data. A lot of vocoders leverage GAN to ensure the audio generation quality, including\nWaveGAN [68], GAN-TTS [23], MelGAN [178], Parallel WaveGAN [402], HiFi-GAN [174], and\nother GAN-based vocoders [401, 391, 312, 417, 372, 137].\nTable 5: Several representative GAN based vocoders and their characteristics.\nGAN\nGenerator\nDiscriminator\nLoss\nWaveGAN [68]\nDCGAN [287]\n/\nWGAN-GP [97]\nGAN-TTS [23]\n/\nRandom Window D\nHinge-Loss GAN [198]\nMelGAN [178]\n/\nMulti-Scale D\nLS-GAN [231]\nFeature Matching Loss [182]\nPar.WaveGAN [402]\nWaveNet [254]\n/\nLS-GAN,\nMulti-STFT Loss\nHiFi-GAN [174]\nMulti-Receptive\nField Fusion\nMulti-Period D,\nLS-GAN, STFT Loss,\nMulti-Scale D\nFeature Matching Loss\nVocGAN [408]\nMulti-Scale G\nHierarchical D\nLS-GAN, Multi-STFT Loss,\nFeature Matching Loss\nGED [96]\n/\nRandom Window D\nHinge-Loss GAN,\nRepulsive loss\nWe summarize the characteristics according to the generators, discriminators, and losses used in each\nvocoder in Table 5.\n\u2022 Generator. Most GAN-based vocoders use dilated convolution to increase the receptive \ufb01eld\nto model the long-dependency in waveform sequence, and transposed convolution to upsample\nthe condition information (e.g., linguistic features or mel-spectrograms) to match the length of\nwaveform sequence. Yamamoto et al. [402] choose to upsample the conditional information one\ntime, and then perform dilated convolution to ensure model capacity. However, this kind of upsam-\npling increases the sequence length too early, resulting larger computation cost. Therefore, some\nvocoders [178, 174] choose to iteratively upsample the condition information and perform dilated\nconvolution, which can avoid too long sequence in the lower layers. Speci\ufb01cally, VocGAN [408]\nproposes a multi-scale generator that can gradually output waveform sequence at different scales,\nfrom coarse-grained to \ufb01ne-grained. HiFi-GAN [174] processes different patterns of various lengths\nin parallel through a multi-receptive \ufb01eld fusion module, and also has the \ufb02exibility to trade off\nbetween synthesis ef\ufb01ciency and sample quality.\n\u2022 Discriminator. The research efforts [23, 178, 174, 408] on discriminators focus on how to design\nmodels to capture the characteristics of waveform, in order to provide better guiding signal for the\ngenerators. We review these efforts as follows: 1) Random window discriminators, proposed in\nGAN-TTS [23], which use multiple discriminators, where each is feeding with different random\nwindows of waveform with and without conditional information. Random window discriminators\n14\nhave several bene\ufb01ts, such as evaluating audios in different complementary way, simplifying the\ntrue/false judgements compared with full audio, and acting as a data augmentation effect, etc.\n2) Multi-scale discriminators, proposed in MelGAN [178], which use multiple discriminators to\njudge audios in different scales (different downsampling ratios compared with original audio). The\nadvantage of multi-scale discriminators is that the discriminator in each scale can focus on the\ncharacteristics in different frequency ranges. 3) Multi-period discriminators, proposed in HiFi-\nGAN [174], which leverage multiple discriminators, where each accepts equally spaced samples of\nan input audio with a period. Speci\ufb01cally, the 1D waveform sequence with a length of T is reshaped\ninto a 2D data [p, T/p] where p is the period, and processed by a 2D convolution. Multi-period\ndiscriminators can capture different implicit structures by looking at different parts of an input\naudio in different periods. 4) Hierarchical discriminators, leveraged in VocGAN [408] to judge the\ngenerated waveform in different resolutions from coarse-grained to \ufb01ne-grained, which can guide\nthe generator to learn the mapping between the acoustic features and waveform in both low and\nhigh frequencies.\n\u2022 Loss. Except for the regular GAN losses such as WGAN-GP [97], hinge-loss GAN [198], and\nLS-GAN [231], other speci\ufb01c losses such as STFT loss [10, 401] and feature matching loss [182]\nare also leveraged. These additional losses can improve the stability and ef\ufb01ciency of adversarial\ntraining [402], and improve the perceptual audio quality. Gritsenko et al. [96] propose a generalized\nenergy distance with a repulsive term to better capture the multi-modal waveform distribution.\nDiffusion-based Vocoders\nRecently, there are some works leveraging denoising diffusion proba-\nbilistic models (DDPM or Diffusion) [113] for vocoders, such as DiffWave [176], WaveGrad [41],\nand PriorGrad [185]. The basic idea is to formulate the mapping between data and latent distributions\nwith diffusion process and reverse process: in the diffusion process, the waveform data sample is\ngradually added with some random noises and \ufb01nally becomes Gaussion noise; in the reverse process,\nthe random Gaussion noise is gradually denoised into waveform data sample step by step. Diffusion-\nbased vocoders can generate speech with very high voice quality, but suffer from slow inference\nspeed due to the long iterative process. Thus, a lot of works on diffusion models [313, 185, 384, 175]\nare investigating how to reduce inference time while maintaining generation quality.\nOther Vocoders\nSome works leverage neural-based source-\ufb01lter model for waveform genera-\ntion [381, 380, 377, 213, 149, 148, 77, 311, 414], aiming to achieve high voice quality while\nmaintaining controllable speech generation. Govalkar et al. [91] conduct a comprehensive study on\ndifferent kinds of vocoders. Hsu et al. [118] study the robustness of vocoders by evaluating several\ncommon vocoders with comprehensive experiments.\nDiscussions\nWe summarize the characteristics of different kinds of generative models used in\nvocoders, as shown in Table 6: 1) In terms of mathematical simplicity, autoregressive (AR) based\nmodels are easier than other generative models such as VAE, Flow, Diffusion, and GAN. 2) All the\ngenerative models except AR can support parallel speech generation. 3) Except for AR models, all\ngenerative models can support latent manipulations to some extent (some GAN-based vocoders do\nnot take random Gaussian noise as model input, and thus cannot support latent manipulation). 4)\nGAN-based models cannot estimate the likelihood of data samples, while other models enjoy this\nbene\ufb01t.\nTable 6: Some characteristics of several representative generative models used in vocoders.\nGenerative Model\nAR\nVAE\nFlow/AR\nFlow/Bipartite\nDiffusion\nGAN\nVocoder (e.g.)\nWaveNet\nWaveVAE\nPar.WaveNet\nWaveGlow\nDiffWave\nMelGAN\nSimple\nY\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nParallel\nN\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nLatent Manipulate\nN\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY*\nLikelihood Estimate\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nN\n15\nAcoustic Model\nVocoder\nWaveform\nMel-\nSpectrogram\nText Analysis\nVocoder\nCharacter\nWaveform\nLinguistic \nFeatures\nFully End-to-End TTS Model\nCharacter/Phoneme\nWaveform\nAcoustic Model\nVocoder\nWaveform\nAcoustic \nFeatures\nCharacter/Phoneme\nCharacter/Phoneme\nAcoustic Model\nVocoder\nWaveform\nAcoustic \nFeatures\nCharacter\nText Analysis\nLinguistic \nFeatures\n0:\n1:\n2:\n3:\n4:\nStage\nModels\n0\nSPSS [416, 356, 415, 425, 357]\n1\nARST [375]\n2\nWaveNet [254], DeepVoice 1/2 [8, 87], Par.

For example, for a speech with a length of 5\nseconds and about 20 words, the length of the phoneme sequence is just about 100, while the length\nof the waveform sequence is 80k (if the sample rate is 16kHz). It is hard to put the waveform points\nof the whole utterance into model training, due to the limit of memory. It is hard to capture the\ncontext representations if only using a short audio clip for the end-to-end training.\nDue to the dif\ufb01culty of fully end-to-end training, the development of neural TTS follows a progressive\nprocess towards fully end-to-end models. Figure 4 illustrates this progressive process starting\nfrom early statistic parametric synthesis [416, 356, 415, 425, 357]. The process towards fully\nend-to-end models typically contains these upgrades: 1) Simplifying text analysis module and\nlinguistic features. In SPSS, text analysis module contains different functionalities such as text\nnormalization, phrase/word/syllable segmentation, POS tagging, prosody prediction, grapheme-to-\nphoneme conversion (including polyphone disambiguation). In end-to-end models, only the text\nnormalization and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion are retained to convert characters into phonemes,\nor the whole text analysis module is removed by directly taking characters as input. 2) Simplifying\nacoustic features, where the complicated acoustic features such as MGC, BAP and F0 used in SPSS\nare simpli\ufb01ed into mel-spectrograms. 3) Replacing two or three modules with a single end-to-end\nmodel. For example, the acoustic models and vocoders can be replaced with a single vocoder model\nsuch as WaveNet. Accordingly, we illustrate the progressive process in Figure 4 and describe it as\nfollows.\n\u2022 Stage 0. Statistic parametric synthesis [416, 356, 415, 425, 357] uses three basic modules, where\ntext analysis module converts characters into linguistic features, and acoustic models generate\nacoustic features from linguistic features (where the target acoustic features are obtained through\nvocoder analysis), and then vocoders synthesize speech waveform from acoustic features through\nparametric calculation.\n16\nTable 7: A list of fully end-to-end TTS models.\nModel\nOne-Stage Training\nAR/NAR\nModeling\nArchitecture\nChar2Wav [315]\nN\nAR\nSeq2Seq\nRNN\nClariNet [269]\nN\nAR\nFlow\nCNN\nFastSpeech 2s [292]\nY\nNAR\nGAN\nSelf-Att/CNN\nEATS [69]\nY\nNAR\nGAN\nCNN\nWave-Tacotron [385]\nY\nAR\nFlow\nCNN/RNN/Hybrid\nEf\ufb01cientTTS-Wav [235]\nY\nNAR\nGAN\nCNN\nVITS [160]\nY\nNAR\nVAE+Flow\nCNN/Self-Att/Hybrid\n\u2022 Stage 1. Wang et al. [375] in statistic parametric synthesis explore to combine the text analysis and\nacoustic model into an end-to-end acoustic model that directly generates acoustic features from\nphoneme sequence, and then uses a vocoder in SPSS to generate waveform.\n\u2022 Stage 2. WaveNet [254] is \ufb01rst proposed to directly generate speech waveform from linguistic\nfeatures, which can be regarded as a combination of an acoustic model and a vocoder. This kind of\nmodels [254, 255, 150, 23] still require a text analysis module to generate linguistic features.\n\u2022 Stage 3. Tacotron [382] is further proposed to simplify linguistic and acoustic features, which\ndirectly predicts linear-spectrograms from characters/phonemes with an encoder-attention-decoder\nmodel, and converts linear-spectrograms into waveform with Grif\ufb01n-Lim [95]. The following\nworks such as DeepVoice 3 [270], Tacotron 2 [303], TransformerTTS [192], and FastSpeech\n1/2 [290, 292] predict mel-spectrograms from characters/phonemes and further use a neural vocoder\nsuch as WaveNet [254], WaveRNN [150], WaveGlow [279], FloWaveNet [163], and Parallel\nWaveGAN [402] to generate waveform.\n\u2022 Stage 4. Some fully end-to-end TTS models are developed for direct text to waveform synthesis, as\nlisted in Table 7. Char2Wav [315] leverages an RNN-based encoder-attention-decoder model to\ngenerate acoustic features from characters, and then uses SampleRNN [233] to generate waveform.\nThe two models are jointly tuned for direct speech synthesis. Similarly, ClariNet [269] jointly\ntunes an autoregressive acoustic model and a non-autoregressive vocoder for direct waveform\ngeneration. FastSpeech 2s [292] directly generate speech from text with a fully parallel structure,\nwhich can greatly speed up inference. To alleviate the dif\ufb01culty of joint text-to-waveform training,\nit leverages an auxiliary mel-spectrogram decoder to help learn the contextual representations of\nphoneme sequence. A concurrent work called EATS [69] also directly generates waveform from\ncharacters/phonemes, which leverages duration interpolation and soft dynamic time wrapping loss\nfor end-to-end alignment learning. Wave-Tacotron [385] builds a \ufb02ow-based decoder on Tacotron\nto directly generate waveform, which uses parallel waveform generation in the \ufb02ow part but still\nautoregressive generation in the Tacotron part.\n2.6\nOther Taxonomies\nBesides the main taxonomy from the perspective of key components and data \ufb02ow as shown in\nFigure 3, we can also categorize TTS works from several different taxonomies, as shown in Figure 5:\n1) Autoregressive or non-autoregressive. We can divide these works into autoregressive and non-\nautoregressive generation models. 2) Generative model. Since TTS is a typical sequence generation\ntask and can be modeled through typical generative models, we can categorize in terms of different\ngenerative models: normal sequence generation model, \ufb02ow, GAN, VAE, and diffusion model. 3)\nNetwork structure. We can divide the works according to their network structures, such as CNN,\nRNN, self-attention, and hybrid structures (which contains more than one type of structures, such as\nCNN+RNN, CNN+self-attention).\nEvolution of Neural TTS Models\nIn order to better understand the development of various research\nworks on neural TTS and their relationships, we illustrate the evolution of neural TTS models, as\nshown in Figure 6. Note that we organize the research works according to the time that the paper is\nopen to the public (e.g., put on arXiv), but not formally published later. We choose the early time\nsince we appreciate researchers making their paper public early to encourage knowledge sharing.\n17\nAR or NAR\nAR\nWaveNet [254], SampleRNN [233], WaveRNN [150],\nDeepVoice 1/2/3 [8, 87, 270], Tacotron 1/2 [382, 303],\nTransformerTTS [192]\nNAR\nPar.WaveNet [255], WaveGlow [279], FloWaveNet [163],\nMelGAN [178], FastSpeech 1/2/2s [290, 292], EATS [69],\nParaNet [268], VITS [160], HiFi-GAN [174]\nGenerative Model\nSeq2Seq\nWaveNet [254], DeepVoice 1/2/3 [8, 87, 270],\nTacotron 1/2 [382, 303], WaveRNN [150],\nFastSpeech 1/2 [290, 292]\nFlow\nPar.WaveNet [255], ClariNet [269], FloWaveNet [163],\nWaveGlow [279], WaveFlow [271], Glow-TTS [159],\nFlow-TTS [234], Flowtron [366], Wave-Tacotron [385]\nGAN\nWaveGAN [68], GAN-TTS [23], MelGAN [178],\nPar.WaveGAN [402], FastSpeech 2s [292], EATS [69],\nHiFi-GAN [174], VocGAN [408], Multi-SpectroGAN [186]\nVAE\nWaveVAE [268], VAE-TTS [443], GMVAE-Tacotron [119]\nDiffusion\nDiffWave [176], WaveGrad [41], Diff-TTS [141],\nGrad-TTS [276], PriorGrad [185]\nNetwork Structure\nCNN\nWaveNet [254], Par.WaveNet [255], DeepVoice 3 [270],\nClariNet [269], ParaNet [268], MelGAN [178], EATS [69],\nDCTTS [332], WaveGlow [279], FloWaveNet [163]\nRNN\nSampleRNN [233], Tacotron 2 [303], WaveRNN [150],\nLPCNet [363], DurIAN [418]\nSelf-Att\nTransformerTTS [192], FastSpeech 1/2/2s [290, 292],\nAlignTTS [429], FastPitch [181], JDI-T [197]\nHybrid\nDeepVoice 1/2 [8, 87], Tacotron [382], DurIAN [418],\nLightSpeech [220], Wave-Tacotron [385]\nFigure 5: Some other taxonomies of neural TTS from the perspectives of AR/NAR, generative model,\nand network structure.\nSince the research works on neural TTS are so abundant, we only choose some representative works\nin Figure 6, and list more works in Table 18.\n3\nAdvanced Topics in TTS\n3.1\nBackground and Taxonomy\nIn previous section, we have introduced neural TTS in terms of basic model components. In this\nsection, we review some advanced topics in neural TTS that aim to push the frontier and cover\nmore practical product usage. Speci\ufb01cally, as TTS is a typical sequence to sequence generation task\nwith slow autoregressive generation, how to speed up the autoregressive generation or reduce the\nmodel size for fast speech synthesis is a hot research topic (Section 3.2). A good TTS system should\ngenerate both natural and intelligible speech and a lot of TTS research works aim to improve the\nintelligibility and naturalness of speech synthesis. For example, in low-resource scenarios where the\ndata to train a TTS model is not enough, the synthesized speech may have both low intelligibility and\nnaturalness. Therefore, a lot of works aim to build data ef\ufb01cient TTS models under low-resource\nsettings (Section 3.3). Since TTS models are prone to suffer from robust issues where the generated\nspeech usually has word skipping and repeating problems that affect the intelligibility, a lot of works\naim to improve the robustness of speech synthesis (Section 3.4). To improve the naturalness, a lot of\nworks aim to model, control, and transfer the style/prosody of speech in order to generate expressive\n18\nAdaSpeech\nGlow-TTS\nWaveNet\nSampleRNN\nDeepVoice\nChar2Wav\nTacotron\nTacotron 2\nDeepVoice 2\nDeepVoice 3\nVoiceLoop\nPara.

Adapting TTS models to support the voice of any target speakers is very\nhelpful for broad usage of TTS. Therefore, ef\ufb01cient voice adaptation with limited adaptation data and\nparameters and with high-quality voice is critical for practical usage (Section 3.6). A taxonomy of\nthese advanced topics are shown in Figure 7.\n3.2\nFast TTS\nText to speech synthesis systems are usually deployed in cloud server or embedded devices, which\nrequire fast synthesis speed. However, early neural TTS models usually adopt autoregressive mel-\nspectrogram and waveform generation, which are very slow considering the long speech sequence\n(e.g., a 1 second speech usually has 500 mel-spetrograms if hop size is 10ms, and 24k waveform\npoints if sampling rate is 24kHz). To solve this problem, different techniques have been leveraged to\nspeed up the inference of TTS models, including 1) non-autoregressive generation that generates mel-\n19\nTTS\nFast\nParallel Generation\nFastSpeech 1/2 [290, 292], Par.WaveNet [255]\nWaveGlow [279], FloWaveNet [163]\nParaNet [268], MelGAN [178], HiFi-GAN [174]\nDiffWave [176], WaveGrad [41], [185, 402, 160]\nLightweight Model\nWaveRNN [150], LightSpeech [220]\nSqueezeWave [433], [151, 117, 126, 431]\nSpeedup with Domain\nKnowledge\nLPCNet [363], Multi-Band [418, 406, 250, 60]\nFFTNet [145], Streaming [76, 223, 322, 405]\nLow-\nResource\nSelf-Supervised Training\n[52, 374, 440, 81, 143, 352, 201, 358, 73, 37]\nCross-Lingual Transfer\nLRSpeech [396], [43, 12, 62, 407, 277, 108]\nCross-Speaker Transfer\n[222, 128, 407, 61, 40]\nSpeech Chain/\nBack Transformation\nSpeechChain [350, 351], LRSpeech [396, 291]\nDataset Mining in the\nWild\n[59, 122, 58]\nRobust\nEnhancing Attention\nTacotron 2 [382], DCTTS [332], SMA [107]\nMultiSpeech [39], [315, 303, 438, 332, 270, 268]\nReplacing Attention\nwith Duration\nFastSpeech [290], DurIAN [418], EATS [69]\nGlow-TTS [159], [194, 19, 361, 429, 75, 304]\nEnhancing AR\nGAN Exposure [99], [205, 209, 291]\nReplacing AR with NAR\nFastSpeech 1/2 [290, 292], ParaNet [268]\nEATS [69], Flow-TTS [234], [159, 204, 361, 75]\nExpressive\nModeling Variation\nInformation\nGST-Tacotron [383], Ref-Tacotron [309], [40]\nMulti-SpectroGAN [186], PriorGrad [185], [49]\nVAE-TTS [443], Glow-TTS [159], [119, 120]\n[102, 4, 366, 103, 324, 325, 366, 70, 141]\nDisentangling/\nControlling/Transferring\nGMVAE-Tacotron [119], DenoiSpeech [434]\n[224, 120, 281, 359, 184, 246, 13, 273, 349]\n[196, 153, 134, 202, 386, 207, 30, 195, 103]\nAdaptive\nGeneral Adaptation\nAdaSpeech 1/3 [40, 404], [57, 266, 123, 38, 212]\nEf\ufb01cient Adaptation\nSEA-TTS [44], DV3-Clone [9], [177, 446, 221]\nSV-Tacotron [142], AdaSpeech 1/2 [40, 403], [56]\nFigure 7: Overview of the advanced topics in neural TTS as described in Section 3.\n20\nspectrograms and waveform in parallel; 2) lightweight and ef\ufb01cient model structure; 3) techniques\nleveraging the domain knowledge of speech for fast speech synthesis.

As can be seen, TTS models that use RNN-\nbased autoregressive models [382, 303, 233, 363] are slow in both training and inference, with\nO(N) computation, where N is the sequence length. To avoid the slow training time caused by\nRNN structure, DeepVoice 3 [270] and TransformerTTS [192] leverage CNN or self-attention based\nstructure that can support parallel training but still require autoregressive inference. To speed up\ninference, FastSpeech 1/2 [290, 292] design a feed-forward Transformer that leverages self-attention\nstructure for both parallel training and inference, where the computation is reduced to O(1). Most\nGAN-based models for mel-spectrogram and waveform generation [178, 174, 292, 69] are non-\nautoregressive, with O(1) computation in both training and inference. Parallel WaveNet [255] and\nClariNet [269] leverage inverse autoregressive \ufb02ow [169], which enable parallel inference but require\nteacher distillation for parallel training. WaveGlow [279] and FloWaveNet [163] leverage generative\n\ufb02ow for parallel training and inference. However, they usually need to stack multiple \ufb02ow iterations\nT to ensure the quality of the mapping between data and prior distributions. Similar to \ufb02ow-based\nmodels, diffusion-based models [41, 176, 185, 141, 276] also require multiple diffusion steps T in\nthe forward and reverse process, which increase the computation.\nLightweight Model\nWhile non-autoregressive generation can fully leverage the parallel compu-\ntation for inference speedup, the number of model parameters and total computation cost are not\nreduced, which make it slow when deploying on the mobile phones or embedded devices since the\nparallel computation capabilities in these devices are not powerful enough. Therefore, we need to\ndesign lightweight and ef\ufb01cient models with less computation cost for inference speedup, even using\nautoregressive generation. Some widely used techniques for designing lightweight models include\npruning, quantization, knowledge distillation [111], and neural architecture search [220, 397], etc.\nWaveRNN [150] uses techniques like dual softmax, weight pruning, subscale prediction to speed\nup inference. LightSpeech [220] leverages neural architecture search [457, 219] to \ufb01nd lightweight\narchitectures to further speed up the inference of FastSpeech 2 [292] by 6.5x, while maintaining voice\nquality. SqueezeWave [433] leverages waveform reshaping to reduce the temporal length and replaces\nthe 1D convolution with depthwise separable convolution to reduce computation cost while achieving\nsimilar audio quality. Kanagawa and Ijima [151] compress the model parameters of LPCNet with\ntensor decomposition. Hsu and Lee [117] propose a heavily compressed \ufb02ow-based model to reduce\ncomputational resources, and a WaveNet-based post-\ufb01lter to maintain audio quality. DeviceTTS [126]\nleverages the model structure of DFSMN [441] and mix-resolution decoder to predict multiple frames\nin one decoding step to speed up inference. LVCNet [431] adopts a location-variable convolution for\ndifferent waveform intervals, where the convolution coef\ufb01cients are predicted from mel-spectrograms.\nIt speeds up the Parallel WaveGAN vocoder by 4x without any degradation in sound quality. Wang\net al. [373] propose a semi-autoregressive mode for mel-spectrogram generation, where the mel-\nspectrograms are generated in an autoregressive mode for individual phoneme and non-autoregressive\nmode for different phonemes.\nSpeedup with Domain Knowledge\nDomain knowledge from speech can be leveraged to speed\nup inference, such as linear prediction [363], multiband modeling [418, 406, 60], subscale predic-\n21\ntion [150], multi-frame prediction [427, 382, 373, 126, 210], streaming synthesis [76], etc. LPC-\nNet [363] combines digital signal processing with neural networks, by using linear prediction\ncoef\ufb01cients to calculate the next waveform and a lightweight model to predict the residual value,\nwhich can speed the inference of autoregressive waveform generation. Another technique that is\nwidely used to speed up the inference of vocoders is subband modeling, which divides the waveform\ninto multiple subbands for fast inference. Typical models include DurIAN [418], multi-band Mel-\nGAN [406], subband WaveNet [250], and multi-band LPCNet [348, 60]. Bunched LPCNet [370]\nreduces the computation complexity of LPCNet with sample bunching and bit bunching, achieving\nmore than 2x speedup. Streaming TTS [76, 223, 322, 405, 323, 237] synthesizes speech once some\ninput tokens are comming, without waiting for the whole input sentence, which can also speed up\ninference. FFTNet [145] uses a simple architecture to mimic the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which\ncan generate audio samples in real-time. Okamoto et al. [251] further enhance FFTNet with noise\nshaping and subband techniques, improving the voice quality while keeping small model size. Popov\net al. [274] propose frame splitting and cross-fading to synthesize some parts of the waveform in\nparallel and then concatenate the synthesized waveforms together to ensure fast synthesis on low-end\ndevices. Kang et al. [152] accelerate DCTTS [332] with network reduction and \ufb01delity improvement\ntechniques such as group highway activation, which can synthesize speech in real time with a single\nCPU thread.\n3.3\nLow-Resource TTS\nBuilding high-quality TTS systems usually requires a large amount of high-quality paired text and\nspeech data. However, there are more than 7,000 languages in the world14, and most languages\nare lack of training data for developing TTS systems. As a result, popular commercialized speech\nservices15 can only support dozens of languages for TTS. Supporting TTS for low-resource languages\ncan not only have business value, but is also bene\ufb01cial for social good. Thus, a lot of research works\nbuild TTS system under low data resource scenarios. We summarize some representative techniques\nfor low-resource TTS in Table 9, and introduce these techniques as follows.\nTable 9: Some representative techniques for low-resource TTS.\nTechniques\nData\nWork\nSelf-supervised Training\nUnpaired text or speech\n[52, 374, 440, 81, 143, 352, 201, 358, 73]\nCross-lingual Transfer\nPaired text and speech\n[43, 396, 12, 407, 62, 277, 108]\nCross-speaker Transfer\nPaired text and speech\n[222, 128, 61, 407, 40]\nSpeech chain/Back transformation\nUnpaired text or speech\n[291, 396, 350, 351]\nDataset mining in the wild\nPaired text and speech\n[59, 122, 58]\n\u2022 Self-supervised training. Although paired text and speech data are hard to collect, unpaired\nspeech and text data (especially text data) are relatively easy to obtain. Self-supervised pre-\ntraining methods can be leveraged to enhance the language understanding or speech generation\ncapabilities [52, 374, 440, 81]. For example, the text encoder in TTS can be enhanced by the\npre-trained BERT models [52, 81, 143], and the speech decoder in TTS can be pre-trained through\nautoregressive mel-spectrogram prediction [52] or jointed trained with voice conversion task [440].\nBesides, speech can be quantized into discrete token sequence to resemble the phoneme or character\nsequence [352]. In this way, the quantized discrete tokens and the speech can be regarded as pseudo\npaired data to pre-train a TTS model, which is then \ufb01ne-tuned on few truly paired text and speech\ndata [201, 358, 436].\n\u2022 Cross-lingual transfer. Although paired text and speech data is scarce in low-resource languages,\nit is abundant in rich-resource languages. Since human languages share similar vocal organs,\npronunciations [389] and semantic structures [341], pre-training the TTS models on rich-resource\nlanguages can help the mapping between text and speech in low-resource languages [43, 396,\n12, 62, 101, 342, 442, 247, 407, 435]. Usually, there are different phoneme sets between rich-\nand low-resource languages. Thus, Chen et al. [43] propose to map the embeddings between the\nphoneme sets from different languages, and LRSpeech [396] discards the pre-trained phoneme\n14https://www.ethnologue.com/browse\n15For example, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon AWS.\n22\nembeddings and initializes the phoneme embeddings from scratch for low-resource languages.\nInternational phonetic alphabet (IPA) [109] or byte representation [108] is adopted to support\narbitrary texts in multiple languages. Besides, language similarity [341] can also be considered\nwhen conducting the cross-lingual transfer.\n\u2022 Cross-speaker transfer. When a certain speaker has limited speech data, the data from other\nspeakers can be leveraged to improve the synthesis quality of this speaker. This can be achieved by\nconverting the voice of other speakers into this target voice through voice conversion to increase\nthe training data [128], or by adapting the TTS models trained on other voices to this target voice\nthrough voice adaptation or voice cloning [44, 40] that are introduced in Section 3.6.\n\u2022 Speech chain/Back transformation. Text to speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nare two dual tasks [285] and can be leveraged together to improve each other. Techniques like\nspeech chain [350, 351] and back transformation [291, 396] leverage additional unpaired text and\nspeech data to boost the performance of TTS and ASR.\n\u2022 Dataset mining in the wild. In some scenarios, there may exist some low-quality paired text and\nspeech data in the Web. Cooper [59], Hu et al. [122] propose to mine this kind of data and develop\nsophisticated techniques to train a TTS model. Some techniques such as speech enhancement [362],\ndenoising [434], and disentangling [383, 120] can be leveraged to improve the quality of the speech\ndata mined in the wild.\n3.4\nRobust TTS\nA good TTS system should be robust to always generate \u201ccorrect\u201d speech according to text even\nwhen encountering corner cases. In neural TTS, robust issues such as word skipping, repeating, and\nattention collapse16 often happen in acoustic models17 when generating mel-spectrogram sequence\nfrom character/phoneme sequence. Basically speaking, the causes of these robust issues are from\ntwo categories: 1) The dif\ufb01culty in learning the alignments between characters/phonemes and\nmel-spectrograms; 2) The exposure bias and error propagation problems incurred in autoregressive\ngeneration. Vocoders do not face severely robust issues, since the acoustic features and waveform are\nalready aligned frame-wisely (i.e., each frame of acoustic features correspond to a certain number\n(hop size) of waveform points). Therefore, existing works on robust TTS address the above two\nproblems respectively18.\n\u2022 For the alignment learning between characters/phonemes and mel-spectrograms, the works can be\ndivided into two aspects: 1) enhancing the robustness of attention mechanism [382, 315, 303, 438,\n332, 107, 39], and 2) removing attention and instead predicting duration explicitly to bridge the\nlength mismatch between text and speech [290, 418, 69, 75].\n\u2022 For the exposure bias and error propagation problems in autoregressive generation, the works can\nalso be divided into two aspects: 1) improving autoregressive generation to alleviate the exposure\nbias and error propagation problems [99, 205, 209, 291], and 2) removing autoregressive generation\nand instead using non-autoregressive generation [290, 292, 268, 69].\nWe summarize some popular techniques in these categories to improve robustness, as shown in\nTable 10. The works addressing the two problems may have overlapping, e.g., some works may\nenhance the attention mechanism in AR or NAR generation, and similarly, the duration prediction\ncan be applied in both AR and NAR generation. We review these categories as follows.\n16Attention collapse means the generated speech has unintelligible gibberish, which is usually caused by the\nnot focused attention on a single input token [107].\n17Robust issues can also happened in neural vocoders, where the generated waveform could have some\nglitches such as hoarseness, metallic noise, jitter, or pitch breaking. However, they are not so severe as in\nacoustic models, and the reasons causing these issues are not clear and more likely to be repaired by universal\nvocoder modeling [215, 265, 137, 144] or sophisticated designs [35]. Thus, we mainly introduce the works\naddressing the robust issues in acoustic models in this survey.\n18There are some other reasons that can cause robust issues, such as the test domain is not well covered by the\ntraining domain. Research works that scale to unseen domain can alleviate this issue, such as increasing the\namount and diversity of the training data [130], adopting relative position encoding to support long sequence\nunseen in training [17, 430], etc.\n23\nTable 10: Categorization of the methods for robust TTS.\nCategory\nTechnique\nWork\nEnhancing Attention\nContent-based attention\n[382, 192]\nLocation-based attention\n[315, 333, 367, 17]\nContent/Location hybrid attention\n[303]\nMonotonic attention\n[438, 107, 411]\nWindowing or off-diagonal penalty\n[332, 438, 270, 39]\nEnhancing enc-dec connection\n[382, 303, 270, 203, 39]\nPositional attention\n[268, 234, 204]\nReplacing Attention with\nDuration Prediction\nLabel from encoder-decoder attention\n[290, 361, 197, 181]\nLabel from CTC alignment\n[19]\nLabel from HMM alignment\n[292, 418, 194, 252, 74, 304]\nDynamic programming\n[429, 193, 235]\nMonotonic alignment search\n[159]\nMonotonic interpolation with soft DTW\n[69, 75]\nEnhancing AR\nProfessor forcing\n[99, 205]\nReducing training/inference gap\n[361]\nKnowledge distillation\n[209]\nBidirectional regularization\n[291, 452]\nReplacing AR with NAR\nParallel generation\n[290, 292, 268, 69]\n3.4.1\nEnhancing Attention\nIn autoregressive acoustic models, a lot of word skipping/repeating and attention collapse issues are\ncaused by the incorrect attention alignments learned in encoder-decoder attention. To alleviate this\nproblem, some properties of the alignments between text (characters/phonemes) sequence and mel-\nspectrogram sequence are considered [107]: 1) Local: one character/phoneme token can be aligned\nto one or multiple consecutive mel-spectrogram frames, while one mel-spectrogram frame can only\nbe aligned to a single character/phoneme token, which can avoid the blurry attention and attention\ncollapse; 2) Monotonic: if character A is behind character B, the mel-spectrogram corresponding\nto A is also behind that corresponding to B, which can avoid word repeating; 3) Complete: each\ncharacter/phoneme token must be covered by at least one mel-spectrogram frame, which can avoid\nword skipping. We analyze the techniques to enhance attention (from Table 10) according to whether\nthey satisfy the above three properties and list them in Table 11. We describe these techniques as\nfollows.\nTable 11: The techniques on enhancing attention and whether they satisfy the three properties\n(local/monotonic/complete).\nTechniques\nLocal\nMonotonic\nComplete\nContent-based attention\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nLocation-based attention\n\u00d7\n\u2713\n\u00d7\nContent/Location hybrid attention\n\u00d7\n\u2713\n\u00d7\nMonotonic attention\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u00d7\nStepwise monotonic attention\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nWindowing or off-diagonal penalty\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nEnhancing enc-dec connection\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nPositional attention\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nPredicting duration\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2022 Content-based attention. The early attention mechanisms adopted in TTS (e.g. Tacotron [382])\nare content-based [14], where the attention distributions are determined by the degree of match\nbetween the hidden representations from the encoder and decoder. Content-based attention is\nsuitable for the tasks such as neural machine translation [14, 368] where the alignments between\nthe source and target tokens are purely based semantic meaning (content). However, for the tasks\nlike automatic speech recognition [50, 34, 48] and text to speech synthesis [382], the alignments\n24\nbetween text and speech have some speci\ufb01c properties. For example, in TTS [107], the attention\nalignments should be local, monotonic, and complete. Therefore, advanced attention mechanisms\nshould be designed to better leverage these properties.\n\u2022 Location-based attention. Considering the alignments between text and speech are depending on\ntheir positions, location-based attention [93, 17] is proposed to leverage the positional information\nfor alignment. Several TTS models such as Char2Wav [315], VoiceLoop [333], and MelNet [367]\nadopt the location-based attention. As we summarize in Table 11, location-based attention can\nensure the monotonicity property if properly handled.\n\u2022 Content/Location-based hybrid attention. To combine the advantages of content and location based\nattentions, Chorowski et al. [50], Shen et al. [303] introduce location sensitive attention: when\ncalculating the current attention alignment, the previous attention alignment is used. In this way,\nthe attention would be more stable due to monotonic alignment.\n\u2022 Monotonic attention. For monotonic attention [288, 47, 107, 411, 347], the attention position is\nmonotonically increasing, which also leverages the prior that the alignments between text and\nspeech are monotonic. In this way, it can avoid the skipping and repeating issues. However, the\ncompleteness property cannot be guaranteed in the above monotonic attention. Therefore, He et al.\n[107] propose stepwise monotonic attention, where in each decoding step, the attention alignment\nposition moves forward at most one step, and is not allowed to skip any input unit.\n\u2022 Windowing or off-diagonal penalty. Since attention alignments are monotonic and diagonal,\nChorowski et al. [50], Tachibana et al. [332], Zhang et al. [438], Ping et al. [270], Chen et al. [39]\npropose to restrict the attention on the source sequence into a window subset. In this way, the\nlearning \ufb02exibility and dif\ufb01culty are reduced. Chen et al. [39] use penalty loss for off-diagonal\nattention weights, by constructing a band mask and encouraging the attention weights to be\ndistributed in the diagonal band.\n\u2022 Enhancing encoder-decoder connection. Since speech has more correlation among adjacent frames,\nthe decoder itself contains enough information to predict next frame, and thus tends to ignore the\ntext information from encoder. Therefore, some works propose to enhance the connection between\nencoder and decoder, and thus can improve attention alignment. Wang et al. [382], Shen et al.\n[303] use multi-frame prediction that generates multiple non-overlapping output frames at each\ndecoder step. In this way, in order to predict consecutive frames, the decoder is forced to leverage\ninformation from the encoder side, which can improve the alignment learning. Other works also\nuse a large dropout in the prenet before the decoder [382, 303, 39], or a small hidden size in the\nprenet as a bottleneck [39], which can prevent simply copying the previous speech frame when\npredicting the current speech frame. The decoder will get more information from the encoder side,\nwhich bene\ufb01ts the alignment learning. Ping et al. [270], Chen et al. [39] propose to enhance the\nconnection of the positional information between source and target sequences, which bene\ufb01ts the\nattention alignment learning. Liu et al. [203] leverage CTC [94] based ASR as a cycle loss to\nencourage the generated mel-spectrograms to contain text information, which can also enhance the\nencoder-decoder connection for better attention alignment.\n\u2022 Positional attention. Some non-autoregressive generation models [268, 234] leverage position\ninformation as the query to attend the key and value from the encoder, which is another way to\nbuild the connection between encoder and decoder for parallel generation.\n3.4.2\nReplacing Attention with Duration Prediction\nWhile improving the attention alignments between text and speech can alleviate the robust issues to\nsome extent, it cannot totally avoid them. Thus, some works [290, 418, 159, 69] propose to totally\nremove the encoder-decoder attention, explicitly predict the duration of each character/phoneme, and\nexpand the text hidden sequence according to the duration to match the length of mel-spectrogram\nsequence. After that, the model can generate mel-spectrogram sequence in an autoregressive or\nnon-autoregressive manner. It is very interesting that the early SPSS uses duration for alignments,\nand then the sequence-to-sequence models remove duration but use attention instead, and the later\nTTS models discard attention and use duration again, which is a kind of technique renaissance.\nExisting works to investigate the duration prediction in neural TTS can be categorized from two\nperspectives: 1) Using external alignment tools or jointly training to get the duration label. 2)\nOptimizing the duration prediction in an end-to-end way or using ground-truth duration in training\n25\nand predicted duration in inference. We summarize the works according to the two perspectives in\nTable 12, and describe them as follows.\nTable 12: A category of neural TTS on duration prediction.\nPerspective\nCategory\nWork\nExternal/Internal\nExternal\nFastSpeech 1/2 [290, 292], DurIAN [418], TalkNet [19], [361, 74, 304]\nInternal\nAlignTTS [429], Glow-TTS [159], EATS [69], [235, 75]\nE2E Optimization\nNot E2E\n[290, 361, 19, 292, 418, 194, 74, 304, 429, 197, 159]\nE2E\nEATS [69], Parallel Tacotron 2 [75]\n\u2022 External alignment. The works leveraging external alignment tools [387, 94, 232, 193] can be\ndivided into several categories according to the used alignment tools: 1) Encoder-decoder attention:\nFastSpeech [290] obtains the duration label from the attention alignments of an autoregressive\nacoustic model. SpeedySpeech [361] follows similar pipeline of FastSpeech to extract the duration\nfrom an autoregressive teacher model, but replaces the whole network structure with purely CNN.\n2) CTC alignment. Beliaev et al. [19] leverages a CTC [94] based ASR model to provide the\nalignments between phoneme and mel-spectrogram sequence. 3) HMM alignment: FastSpeech\n2 [292] leverages the HMM based Montreal forced alignment (MFA) [232] to get the duration.\nOther works such as DurIAN [418], RobuTrans [194], Parallel Tacotron [74], and Non-Attentive\nTacotron [304] use forced alignment or speech recognition tools to get the alignments.\n\u2022 Internal alignment. AlignTTS [429] follows the basic model structure of FastSpeech, but leverages\na dynamic programming based method to learn the alignments between text and mel-spectrogram\nsequences with multi-stage training. JDI-T [197] follows FastSpeech to extract duration from an\nautoregressive teacher model, but jointly trains the autoregressive and non-autoregressive models,\nwhich does not need two-stage training. Glow-TTS [159] leverages a novel monotonic alignment\nsearch to extract duration. EATS [69] leverages the interpolation and soft dynamic time warping\n(DTW) loss to optimize the duration prediction in a fully end-to-end way.\n\u2022 Non end-to-end optimization. Typical duration prediction methods [290, 361, 19, 292, 418, 194, 74,\n304, 429, 197, 159] usually use duration obtained from external/internal alignment tools for training,\nand use predicted duration for inference. The predicted duration is not end-to-end optimized by\nreceiving guiding signal (gradients) from the mel-spectrogram loss.\n\u2022 End-to-end optimization. In order to jointly optimize the duration to achieve better prosody,\nEATS [69] predicts the duration using an internal module and optimizes the duration end-to-end\nwith the help of duration interpolation and soft DTW loss. Parallel Tacotron 2 [75] follows the\npractice of EATS to ensure differentiable duration prediction. Non-Attentive Tacotron [304]\nproposes a semi-supervised learning for duration prediction, where the predicted duration can be\nused for upsampling if no duration label available.\n3.4.3\nEnhancing AR Generation\nAutoregressive sequence generation usually suffers from exposure bias and error propagation [20,\n390]. Exposure bias refers to that the sequence generation model is usually trained by taking previous\nground-truth value as input (i.e., teacher-forcing), but generates the sequence autoregressively by\ntaking previous predicted value as input in inference. The mismatch between training and inference\ncan cause error propagation in inference, where the prediction errors can accumulate quickly along\nthe generated sequence.\nSome works have investigated different methods to alleviate the exposure bias and error propagation\nissues. Guo et al. [99] leverage professor forcing [92] to alleviate the mismatch between the different\ndistributions of real and predicted data. Liu et al. [209] conduct teacher-student distillation [111, 164,\n343] to reduce the exposure bias problem, where the teacher is trained with teacher-forcing mode,\nand the student takes the previously predicted value as input and is optimized to reduce the distance\nof hidden states between the teacher and student models. Considering the right part of the generated\nmel-spectrogram sequence is usually worse than than that in the left part due to error propagation,\nsome works leverage both left-to-right and right-to-left generations [344] for data augmentation [291]\nand regularization [452]. Vainer and Du\u0161ek [361] leverage some data augmentations to alleviate\nthe exposure bias and error propagation issues, by adding some random Gaussian noises to each\n26\ninput spectrogram pixel to simulate the prediction errors, and degrading the input spectrograms by\nrandomly replacing several frames with random frames to encourage the model to use temporally\nmore distant frames.\n3.4.4\nReplacing AR Generation with NAR Generation\nAlthough the exposure bias and error propagation problems in AR generation can be alleviated\nthrough the above methods, the problems cannot be addressed thoroughly. Therefore, some works\ndirectly adopt non-autoregressive generation to avoid these issues. They can be divided into two\ncategories according to the use of attention or duration prediction. Some works such as ParaNet [268]\nand Flow-TTS [234] uses positional attention [270] for the text and speech alignment in parallel\ngeneration. The remaining works such as FastSpeech [290, 292] and EATS [69] use duration\nprediction to bridge the length mismatch between text and speech sequences.\nBased on the introductions in the above subsections, we have a new category of TTS according to\nthe alignment learning and AR/NAR generation, as shown in Table 13: 1) AR + Attention, such\nas Tacotron [382, 303], DeepVoice 3 [270], and TransformerTTS [192]. 2) AR + Non-Attention\n(Duration), such as DurIAN [418], RobuTrans [194], and Non-Attentive Tacotron [304]. 3) Non-\nAR + Attention, such as ParaNet [268], Flow-TTS [234], and VARA-TTS [204]. 4) Non-AR +\nNon-Attention, such as FastSpeech 1/2 [290, 292], Glow-TTS [159], and EATS [69].\nTable 13: A new category of TTS according to the alignment learning and AR/NAR generation.\nAttention?\nAR?\nAR\nNon-AR\nAttention\nTacotron 2 [303], DeepVoice 3 [270]\nParaNet [268], Flow-TTS [234]\nNon-Attention\nDurIAN [418], Non-Att Tacotron [304]\nFastSpeech [290, 292], EATS [69]\n3.5\nExpressive TTS\nThe goal of text to speech is to synthesize intelligible and natural speech. The naturalness largely\ndepends on the expressiveness of synthesized voice, which is determined by multiple characteristics,\nsuch as content, timbre, prosody, emotion, and style, etc. The research on expressiveness TTS covers\nbroad topics including modeling, disentangling, controlling, and transferring the content, timbre,\nprosody, style, and emotion, etc. We review those topics in this subsection.\nA key for expressive speech synthesis is to handle the problem of one-to-many mapping, which refers\nto that there are multiple speech variations corresponding to the same text, in terms of duration, pitch,\nsound volume, speaker style, emotion, etc. Modeling the one-to-many mapping under the regular\nL1 loss [86, 360] without enough input information will cause over-smoothing mel-spectrogram\nprediction [353, 334], e,g., predicting the average mel-spectrograms in the dataset instead of capturing\nthe expressiveness of every single speech utterance, which leads to low-quality and less expressive\nspeech. Therefore, providing these variation information as input and better modeling these variation\ninformation are important to alleviate this problem and improve the expressiveness of synthesized\nspeech. Furthermore, by providing variation information as input, we can disentangle, control, and\ntransfer the variation information: 1) by adjusting these variation information (any speci\ufb01c speaker\ntimbre, style, accent, speaking rate, etc) in inference, we can control the synthesized speech; 2) by\nproviding the variation information corresponding to another style, we can transfer the voice to this\nstyle; 3) in order to achieve \ufb01ne-grained voice control and transfer, we need to disentangle different\nvariation information, such as content and prosody, timbre and noise, etc.\nIn the remaining parts of this subsection, we \ufb01rst conduct a comprehensive analysis on these variation\ninformation, and then introduce some advanced techniques for modeling, disentangling, controlling,\nand transferring these variation information.\n3.5.1\nCategorization of Variation Information\nWe \ufb01rst categorize the information needed to synthesize a voice into four aspects:\n27\n\u2022 Text information, which can be characters or phonemes, represents the content of the synthesized\nspeech (i.e., what to say). Some works improve the representation learning of text through\nenhanced word embeddings or text pre-training [81, 104, 393, 143], aiming to improve the quality\nand expressiveness of synthesized speech.\n\u2022 Speaker or timbre information, which represents the characteristics of speakers (i.e., who to say).\nSome multi-speaker TTS systems explicitly model the speaker representations through a speaker\nlookup table or speaker encoder [87, 270, 142, 240, 39].\n\u2022 Prosody, style, and emotion information, which covers the intonation, stress, and rhythm of speech\nand represents how to say the text [371, 179]. Prosody/style/emotion is the key information to\nimprove the expressiveness of speech and the vast majority of works on expressive TTS focus on\nimproving the prosody/style/emotion of speech [309, 383, 321, 85, 359, 324].\n\u2022 Recording devices or noise environments, which are the channels to convey speech, and are not\nrelated to the content/speaker/prosody of speech, but will affect speech quality. Research works in\nthis area focus on disentangling, controlling, and denoising for clean speech synthesis [120, 40,\n434].\n3.5.2\nModeling Variation Information\nMany methods have been proposed to model different types of variation information in different\ngranularities, as shown in Table 14.\nTable 14: Some perspectives of modeling variation information for expressive speech synthesis.\nPerspective\nCategory\nDescription\nWork\nInformation\nType\nExplicit\nLanguage/Style/Speaker ID\n[445, 247, 195, 162, 39]\nPitch/Duration/Energy\n[290, 292, 181, 158, 239, 365]\nImplicit\nReference encoder\n[309, 383, 224, 142, 9, 49, 37, 40]\nVAE\n[119, 4, 443, 120, 324, 325, 74]\nGAN/Flow/Diffusion\n[224, 186, 366, 234, 159, 141]\nText pre-training\n[81, 104, 393, 143]\nInformation\nGranularity\nLanguage/Speaker Level\nMulti-lingual/speaker TTS\n[445, 247, 39]\nParagraph Level\nLong-form reading\n[11, 395, 376]\nUtterance Level\nTimbre/Prosody/Noise\n[309, 383, 142, 321, 207, 40]\nWord/Syllable Level\nFine-grained information\n[325, 116, 45, 335]\nCharacter/Phoneme Level\n[188, 324, 430, 325, 45, 40, 189]\nFrame Level\n[188, 158, 49, 434]\nInformation Type\nWe can categorize the works according to the types of information being\nmodeled: 1) explicit information, where we can explicitly get the labels of these variation information,\nand 2) implicit information, where we can only implicitly obtain these variation information.\nFor explicit information, we directly use them as input to enhance the models for expressive synthesis.\nWe can obtain these information through different ways: 1) Get the language ID, speaker ID, style,\nand prosody from labeling data [445, 247, 195, 39]. For example, the prosody information can\nbe labeled according to some annotation schemas, such as ToBI [307], AuToBI [294], Tilt [345],\nINTSINT [112], and SLAM [249]. 2) Extract the pitch and energy information from speech and\nextract duration from paired text and speech data [290, 292, 181, 158, 239, 365].\nIn some situations, there are no explicit labels available, or explicit labeling usually causes much\nhuman effort and cannot cover the speci\ufb01c or \ufb01ne-grained variation information. Thus, we can model\nthe variation information implicitly from data. Typical implicit modeling methods include:\n\u2022 Reference encoder [309, 383, 224, 142, 9, 49, 40, 102]. Skerry-Ryan et al. [309] de\ufb01ne the prosody\nas the variation in speech signals that remains after removing variation due to text content, speaker\n28\ntimbre, and channel effects, and model prosody through a reference encoder, which does not require\nexplicit annotations. Speci\ufb01cally, it extracts prosody embeddings from a reference audio, and uses\nit as the input of decoder. During training, a ground-truth reference audio is used, and during\ninference, another refer audio is used to synthesize speech with similar prosody. Wang et al. [383]\nextract embeddings from a reference audio and use them as the query to attend (through Q/K/V\nbased attention [368]) a banks of style tokens, and the attention results are used as the prosody\ncondition of TTS models for expressive speech synthesis. The style tokens can increase the capacity\nand variation of TTS models to learn different kinds of styles, and enable the knowledge sharing\nacross data samples in the dataset. Each token in the style token bank can learn different prosody\nrepresentations, such as different speaking rates and emotions. During inference, it can use a\nreference audio to attend and extract prosody representations, or simply pick one or some style\ntokens to synthesize speech.\n\u2022 Variational autoencoder [119, 4, 443, 120, 103, 324, 325, 74]. Zhang et al. [443] leverage VAE to\nmodel the variance information in the latent space with Gaussian prior as a regularization, which\ncan enable expressive modeling and control on synthesized styles. Some works [4, 120, 2, 74] also\nleverage the VAE framework to better model the variance information for expressive synthesis.\n\u2022 Advanced generative models [224, 186, 366, 234, 159, 70, 141, 185]. One way to alleviate the one-\nto-many mapping problem and combat over-smoothing prediction is to use advanced generative\nmodels to implicitly learn the variation information, which can better model the multi-modal\ndistribution.\n\u2022 Text pre-training [81, 104, 393, 143, 98, 454], which can provide better text representations by\nusing pre-trained word embeddings or model parameters.\nInformation Granularity\nVariation information can be modeled in different granularities. We\ndescribe these information from coarse-grained to \ufb01ne-grained levels: 1) Language level and speaker\nlevel [445, 247, 39], where multilingual and multispeaker TTS systems use language ID or speaker\nID to differentiate languages and speakers. 2) Paragraph level [11, 395, 376], where a TTS model\nneeds to consider the connections between utterances/sentences for long-form reading. 3) Utterance\nlevel [309, 383, 142, 321, 207, 40], where a single hidden vector is extracted from the reference speech\nto represent the timber/style/prosody of this utterance. 4) Word/syllable level [325, 116, 45, 335],\nwhich can model the \ufb01ne-grained style/prosody information that cannot be covered by utterance level\ninformation. 5) Character/phoneme level [188, 324, 430, 325, 45, 40, 189], such as duration, pitch or\nprosody information. 6) Frame level [188, 158, 49, 434], the most \ufb01ne-grained information. Some\ncorresponding works on different granularities can be found in Table 14.\nFurthermore, modeling the variance information with hierarchical structure that covers different\ngranularities is helpful for expressive synthesis. Suni et al. [330] demonstrate that hierarchical\nstructures of prosody intrinsically exist in spoken languages. Kenter et al. [158] predict prosody\nfeatures from frame and phoneme levels to syllable level, and concatenate with word- and sentence-\nlevel features. Hono et al. [116] leverage a multi-grained VAE to obtain different time-resolution\nlatent variables and sample \ufb01ner-level latent variables from coarser-level ones (e.g., from utterance\nlevel to phrase level and then to word level). Sun et al. [325] use VAE to model variance information\non both phoneme and word levels and combine them together to feed into the decoder. Chien and\nLee [45] study on prosody prediction and propose a hierarchical structure from the word to phoneme\nlevel to improve the prosody prediction.\n3.5.3\nDisentangling, Controlling and Transferring\nIn this subsection, we review techniques on disentangling [224, 120, 281], controlling [359, 184, 246,\n13, 273, 349, 196], and transferring [153, 134, 399, 6] variation information, as shown in Table 15.\nDisentangling with Adversarial Training\nWhen multiple styles or prosody information are entan-\ngled together, it is necessary to disentangle them during training for better expressive speech synthesis\nand control. Ma et al. [224] enhance the content-style disentanglement ability and controllability with\nadversarial and collaborative games. Hsu et al. [120] leverage the VAE framework with adversarial\ntraining to disentangle noise from speaker information. Qian et al. [281] propose speech\ufb02ow to\ndisentangle the rhythm, pitch, content, and timbre using three bottleneck reconstructions. Zhang et al.\n[434] propose to disentangle noise from speaker with frame-level noise modeling and adversarial\ntraining.\n29\nTable 15: Some representative techniques for disentangling, controlling, and transferring in expressive\nspeech synthesis.\nTechnique\nDescription\nWork\nDisentangling with Adversarial Training\nDisentanglement for control\n[224, 120, 281, 434]\nCycle Consistency/Feedback for Control\nEnhance style/timbre generation\n[202, 386, 207, 30, 195]\nSemi-Supervised Learning for Control\nUse VAE and adversarial training\n[103, 119, 120, 434, 302]\nChanging Variance Information for Transfer\nDifferent information in inference\n[309, 383, 142, 443, 40]\nCycle Consistency/Feedback Loss for Control\nWhen providing variance information such as\nstyle tag as input, the TTS models are supposed to synthesize speech with the corresponding style.\nHowever, if no constraint is added, the TTS models tend to ignore the variance information and the\nsynthesized speech that does not follow the style. To enhance the contollability of the TTS models,\nsome works propose to use cycle consistency or feedback loss to encourage the synthesized speech to\ncontain the variance information in the input. Li et al. [195] conduct controllable emotional transfer\nby adding an emotion style classi\ufb01er with feedback cycle, where the classi\ufb01er encourages the TTS\nmodel to synthesize speech with speci\ufb01c emotion. Whitehill et al. [386] use style classi\ufb01er to provide\nthe feedback loss to encourage the speech synthesis of a given style. Meanwhile, it incorporates\nadversarial learning between different style classi\ufb01ers to ensure the preservation of different styles\nfrom multiple reference audios. Liu et al. [202] use ASR to provide the feedback loss to train the\nunmatched text and speech, which aims to reduce the mismatch between training and inference, since\nrandom chosen audio is used as the reference in inference. Other works [244, 207, 30, 305, 399, 6]\nleverage the feedback loss to ensure the controllability on style and speaker embeddings, etc.\nSemi-Supervised Learning for Control\nSome attributes used to control the speech include pitch,\nduration, energy, prosody, emotion, speaker, noise, etc. If we have the label for each attribute, we\ncan easily control the synthesized speech, by using the tag as input for model training and using the\ncorresponding tag to control the synthesized speech in inference. However, when there is no tag/label\navailable, or only a part is available, how to disentangle and control these attributes are challenging.\nWhen partial label is available, Habib et al. [103] propose semi-supervised learning method to learn\nthe latent of VAE model, in order to control attributes such as affect or speaking rate. When no\nlabel available, Hsu et al. [119] propose Gaussian mixture VAE models to disentangle different\nattributes, and Hsu et al. [120], Zhang et al. [434] leverage gradient reversal or adversarial training to\ndisentangle speaker timbre from noise in order to synthesize clean speech for noisy speakers.\nChanging Variance Information for Transfer\nWe can transfer the style of synthesized speech by\nchanging the variation information to different styles. If the variation information is provided in the\nlabeled tag, we can use the speech and the corresponding tag in training, and transfer the style with\ncorresponding tags in inference [445, 247, 195, 39]. Alternatively, if we do not have labeled tag for\nthe variation information, we can get the variation information from speech during training, no matter\nthrough explicit or implicit modeling as introduced above: Pitch, duration and energy can be explicitly\nextracted from speech, and some latent representations can be implicitly extracted by reference\nencoder or VAE. In this way, in order to achieve style transfer in inference, we can obtain the variation\ninformation in three ways: 1) extracting from reference speech [309, 383, 142, 443, 49, 40, 399, 6];\n2) predicting from text [321, 290, 324, 430, 292, 40]; 3) obtaining by sampling from the latent space\n[383, 443, 119].\n3.6\nAdaptive TTS\nAdaptive TTS19 is an important feature for TTS that can synthesize voice for any user. It is known as\ndifferent terms in academia and industry, such as voice adaptation [44], voice cloning [9], custom\nvoice [40], etc. Adaptive TTS has been a hot research topic, e,g., a lot of works in statistic parametric\nspeech synthesis have studied voice adaptation [79, 392, 450, 80, 67, 125], and the recent voice\ncloning challenge also attracts a lot of participants [394, 121, 337, 46]. In adaptive TTS scenario, a\nsource TTS model (usually trained on a multi-speaker speech dataset) is usually adapted with few\nadaptation data for each target voice.\n19Here we mainly discuss adaptive TTS for different voices, instead of languages, styles, domains, etc.\n30\nWe review the works on adaptive TTS from two perspectives: 1) General adaptation setting, which\ncovers the improvements of generalization of source TTS model to support new speakers, and\nthe adaptation to different domains. 2) Ef\ufb01cient adaptation setting, which covers the reduction of\nadaptation data and adaptation parameters for each target speaker. We summarize the works in the\ntwo perspectives in Table 16 and introduce these works as follows.\nTable 16: The research works in adaptive TTS from two perspectives.\nCategory\nTopic\nWork\nGeneral Adaptation\nModeling Variation Information\n[40]\nIncreasing Data Coverage\n[57, 407]\nCross-Acoustic Adaptation\n[40, 54]\nCross-Style Adaptation\n[404, 266, 123]\nCross-Lingual Adaptation\n[445, 38, 212]\nEf\ufb01cient Adaptation\nFew-Data Adaptation\n[44, 9, 177, 240, 446, 49, 40, 236]\nUntranscribed Data Adaptation\n[403, 133, 221]\nFew-Parameter Adaptation\n[9, 44, 40]\nZero-Shot Adaptation\n[9, 44, 142, 56]\n3.6.1\nGeneral Adaptation\nSource Model Generalization\nThe works in this category aim to improve the generalization of\nsource TTS model. In source model training, the source text does not contain enough acoustic\ninformation such as prosody, speaker timbre, and recording environments to generate target speech.\nAs a result, the TTS model is prone to over\ufb01t on the training data and has poor generalization for new\nspeakers in adaptation. Chen et al. [40] propose acoustic condition modeling to provide necessary\nacoustic information as model input to learn the text-to-speech mapping with better generalization\ninstead of memorizing. Another way to improve the generalization of source TTS model is to\nincrease the amount and diversity of training data. Cooper et al. [57] leverage speaker augmentation\nto increase the number of speakers when training source TTS model, which can generalize well to\nunseen speakers in adaptation. Yang and He [407] train a universal TTS model with multiple speakers\nin 50 language locales, which increase the generalization when adapting to a new speaker.\nCross-Domain Adaptation\nIn adaptive TTS, an important factor is that the adaptation speech has\ndifferent acoustic conditions or styles with the speech data used to train the source TTS model. In\nthis way, special designs need to be considered to improve the generalization of source TTS model\nand support the styles in target speakers. AdaSpeech [40] designs acoustic condition modeling to\nbetter model the acoustic conditions such as recording devices, environment noise, accents, speaker\nrates, speaker timbre, etc. In this way, the model tends to generalize instead of memorizing the\nacoustic conditions, and can be well adapted to the speech data with different acoustic conditions.\nAdaSpeech 3 [404] adapts a reading-style TTS model to spontaneous style, by designing speci\ufb01c\n\ufb01lled pauses adaptation, rhythm adaptation, and timbre adaptation. Some other works [266, 123]\nconsider the adaptation across different speaking styles, such as Lombard [266] or whisper [123].\nSome works [445, 38, 212, 449, 110, 319, 225, 453, 109] propose to transfer voices across languages,\ne.g., synthesize Mandarin speech using an English speaker, where the English speaker does not have\nany Mandarin speech data.\n3.6.2\nEf\ufb01cient Adaptation\nRoughly speaking, more adaptation data will result in better voice quality, but incur high data\ncollection cost. For adaptation parameters, the whole TTS model [44, 177], or part of the model (e.g.,\ndecoder) [240, 446], or only speaker embedding [9, 44, 40] can be \ufb01ne-tuned. Similarly, \ufb01ne-tuning\nmore parameters will result in good voice quality, but increase the memory and deployment cost. In\npractice, we aim to adapt as few data and parameters as possible while achieving high adaptation\nvoice quality. We divide the works in this category into several aspects: 1) few data adaptation; 2)\nfew parameter adaptation; 3) untranscribed data adaptation; 4) zero-shot adaptation. We introduce\nthese works as follows.\n31\n\u2022 Few data adaptation. Some works [44, 9, 177, 240, 446, 49, 46, 40, 236] conduct few-shot\nadaptation that only uses few paired text and speech data, varying from several minutes to several\nseconds. Chien et al. [46] explore different speaker embeddings for few-shot adaptation. Yue et al.\n[420] leverage speech chain [350] for few-shot adaptation. Chen et al. [40], Ar\u0131k et al. [9] compare\nthe voice quality with different amounts of adaptation data and \ufb01nd that voice quality improves\nquickly with the increase of adaptation data when data size is small (less than 20 sentences) and\nimproves slowly with dozens of adaptation sentences.\n\u2022 Few parameter adaptation. To support many users/customers, the adaptation parameters need to be\nsmall enough for each target speaker to reduce memory usage while maintaining high voice quality.\nFor example, if each user/voice consumes 100MB parameters, the total memory storage equals to\n100PB for 1M users, which is a huge memory cost. Some works propose to reduce the adaptation\nparameter as few as possible, while maintaining the adaptation quality. AdaSpeech [40] proposes\nconditional layer normalization to generate the scale and bias parameters in layer normalization\nfrom the speaker embeddings based on contextual parameter generation [272] and only \ufb01ne-tune\nthe parameters related to the conditional layer normalization and speaker embeddings to achieve\ngood adaptation quality. Moss et al. [240] propose a \ufb01ne-tuning method that selects different model\nhyperparameters for different speakers based on the Bayesian optimization, which achieves the\ngoal of synthesizing the voice of a speci\ufb01c speaker with only a small number of speech samples.\n\u2022 Untranscribed data adaptation. In many scenarios, only speech data can be collected such as\nin conversions or online meetings, without the corresponding transcripts. AdaSpeech 2 [403]\nleverages untranscribed speech data for voice adaptation, with the help of speech reconstruction\nand latent alignments [221]. Inoue et al. [133] use an ASR model to transcribe the speech data and\nuse the transcribed paired data for voice adaptation.\n\u2022 Zero-shot adaptation. Some works [9, 44, 142, 56, 32] conduct zero-shot adaptation, which leverage\na speaker encoder to extract speaker embeddings given a reference audio. This scenario is quite\nappealing since no adaptation data and parameters are needed. However, the adaptation quality is\nnot good enough especially when the target speaker is very different from the source speakers.\n4\nResources\nWe collect some resources of TTS, including

acoustic models, vocoders, and fully end-to-end models, and\n(2) several advanced topics including fast TTS, low-resource TTS, robust TTS, expressive TTS, and\nadaptive TTS. As a quick summary, we list representative TTS algorithms in Table 18. Due to page\nlimitations, we only reviewed core algorithms of TTS; readers can refer to other papers for TTS related\nproblems and applications, such as voice conversion [308], singing voice synthesis [115, 217, 35],\ntalking face synthesis [36], etc.\n33\nWe point out some future research directions on neural TTS, mainly in two categories according to\nthe end goals of TTS.\nHigh-quality speech synthesis\nThe most important goal of TTS is to synthesize high-quality\nspeech. The quality of speech is determined by many aspects that in\ufb02uence the perception of\nspeech, including intelligibility, naturalness, expressiveness, prosody, emotion, style, robustness,\ncontrollability, etc. While neural approaches have signi\ufb01cantly improved the quality of synthesized\nspeech, there is still large room to make further improvements.\n\u2022 Powerful generative models. TTS is a generation task, including the generation of waveform and/or\nacoustic features, which can be better handled by powerful generative models. Although advanced\ngenerative models based on VAE, GAN, \ufb02ow, or diffusion have been adopted in acoustic models,\nvocoders and fully end-to-to models, research efforts on more powerful and ef\ufb01cient generative\nmodels are appealing to further improve the quality of synthesized speech.\n\u2022 Better representation learning. Good representations of text and speech are bene\ufb01cial for neural\nTTS models, which can improve the quality of synthesized speech. Some initial explorations on text\npre-training indicate that better text representations can indeed improve the speech prosody. How\nto learn powerful representations for text/phoneme sequence and especially for speech sequence\nthrough unsupervised/self-supervised learning and pre-training is challenging and worth further\nexplorations.\n\u2022 Robust speech synthesis. While current TTS models eliminate word skipping and repeating issues\ncaused by incorrect attention alignments, they still suffer from robustness issues when encountering\ncorner cases that are not covered in the training set, such as longer text length, different text\ndomains, etc. Improving the generalizability of the TTS model to different domains is critical for\nrobust synthesis.\n\u2022 Expressive/controllable/transferrable speech synthesis. The expressiveness, controllability and\ntransferability of TTS models rely on better variation information modeling. Existing methods\nleverage reference encoder or explicit prosody features (e.g., pitch, duration, energy) for varia-\ntion modeling, which enjoys good controllability and transferrability in inference but suffering\nfrom training/inference mismatch since ground-truth reference speech or prosody features used\nin training are usually unavailable in inference. Advanced TTS models capture the variation\ninformation implicitly, which enjoy good expressiveness in synthesized speech but perform not\ngood in control and transfer, since sampling from latent space cannot explicitly and precisely\ncontrol and transfer each prosody feature (e.g., pitch, style). How to design better methods for\nexpressive/controllable/transferrable speech synthesis is also appealing.\n\u2022 More human-like speech synthesis. Current speech recordings used in TTS training are usually in\nformal reading styles, where no pauses, repeats, changing speeds, varying emotions, and errors\nare permitted. However, in casual or conversational talking, human seldomly speaks like standard\nreading. Therefore, better modelling the casual, emotional, and spontaneous styles is critical to\nimprove the naturalness of synthesized speech.\nEf\ufb01cient speech synthesis\nOnce we can synthesize high-quality speech, the next most important\ntask is ef\ufb01cient synthesis, i.e., how to reduce the cost of speech synthesis including the cost of\ncollecting and labeling training data, training and serving TTS models, etc.\n\u2022 Data-ef\ufb01cient TTS. Many low-resource languages are lack of training data. How to leverage\nunsupervised/semi-supervised learning and cross-lingual transfer learning to help the low-resource\nlanguages is an interesting direction. For example, the ZeroSpeech Challenge [432] is a good\ninitiative to explore the techniques to learn only from speech, without any text or linguistic\nknowledge. Besides, in voice adaptation, a target speaker usually has little adaptation data, which\nis another application scenario for data-ef\ufb01cient TTS.\n\u2022 Parameter-ef\ufb01cient TTS. Today\u2019s neural TTS systems usually employ large neural networks with\ntens of millions of parameters to synthesize high-quality speech, which block the applications\nin mobile, IoT and other low-end devices due to their limited memory and power consumption.\nDesigning compact and lightweight models with less memory footprints, power consumption and\nlatency are critical for those application scenarios.\n\u2022 Energy-ef\ufb01cient TTS. Training and serving a high-quality TTS model consume a lot of energy and\nemit a lot of carbon. Improving energy ef\ufb01ciency, e.g., reducing the FLOPs in TTS training and\n34\ninference, is important to let more populations to bene\ufb01t from advanced TTS techniques while\nreducing carbon emissions to protect our environment.\nTable 18: Overview of TTS models. \u201cAM\u201d represents acoustic models, \u201cVoc\u201d represents vocoders,\n\u201cE2E\u201d represents fully end-to-end models, \u201cling\u201d represents linguistic features, \u201cch\u201d represents char-\nacters, \u201cph\u201d represents phonemes, \u201cceps\u201d represents cepstrums, \u201clinS\u201d represents linear-spectrograms,\n\u201cmelS\u201d represents mel-spectrograms, \u201cwav\u201d represents waveform, \u201cFF\u201d represents feed-forward, \u201cAR\u201d\nrepresents autoregressive, \u201c\u2205\u201d represents no conditional information, \u201cIS\u201d represents INTERSPEECH.\nModel\nAM/Voc\nData Flow\nPublication\nTime\nWaveNet [254]\nVoc\nling\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nSSW16\n2016.09\nSampleRNN [233]\nVoc\n\u2205\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICLR17\n2016.12\nDeep Voice [8]\nAM+Voc\nch\u2192ph\u2192ling\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICML17\n2017.02\nChar2Wav [315]\nE2E\nch\nAR\n\u2212\u2192ceps\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICLR17 WS\n2017.02\nTacotron [382]\nAM\nch/ph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192linS\u2212\u2192wav\nIS17\n2017.03\nDeep Voice 2 [87]\nAM+Voc\nch\u2192ph\nFF\n\u2212\u2192ling\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nNIPS17\n2017.05\nDV2-Tacotron [87]\nAM+Voc\nch\nAR\n\u2212\u2192linS\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nNIPS17\n2017.05\nVoiceLoop [333]\nAM\nph\u2192ceps\u2212\u2192wav\nICLR18\n2017.07\nDeep Voice 3 [270]\nAM\nch/ph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192melS\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICLR18\n2017.10\nDCTTS [332]\nAM\nch\nAR\n\u2212\u2192melS\u2212\u2192wav\nICASSP18\n2017.10\nPar.WaveNet [255]\nVoc\nling\nFF\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICML18\n2017.11\nTacotron 2 [303]\nAM\nch/ph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192melS\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICASSP18\n2017.12\nWaveGAN [68]\nVoc\n\u2205\nFF\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICLR19\n2018.02\nWaveRNN [150]\nVoc\nling\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICML18\n2018.02\nDV3-Clone [9]\nAM\nch/ph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192linS\u2192wav\nNeurIPS18\n2018.02\nGST-Tacotron [383]\nAM\nph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192melS\u2192wav\nICML18\n2018.03\nRef-Tacotron [309]\nAM\nph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192melS\u2192wav\nICML18\n2018.03\nFFTNet [145]\nVoc\nceps\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICASSP18\n2018.04\nVAE-Loop [4]\nAM\nph\u2192ceps\u2212\u2192wav\nIS18\n2018.04\nSV-Tacotron [142]\nAM\nch/ph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192melS\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nNeurIPS18\n2018.06\nClariNet [269]\nE2E\nch/ph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICLR19\n2018.07\nForwardAtt [438]\nAM\nph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192linS\u2192wav\nICASSP18\n2018.07\nMCNN [10]\nVoc\nlinS\nFF\n\u2212\u2192wav\nSPL18\n2018.08\nTransformerTTS [192]\nAM\nph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192melS\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nAAAI19\n2018.09\nSEA-TTS [44]\nVoc\nling\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICLR19\n2018.09\nGMVAE-Tacotron [119]\nAM\nph\nAR\n\u2212\u2192melS\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICLR19\n2018.10\nLPCNet [363]\nVoc\nceps\nAR\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICASSP19\n2018.10\nWaveGlow [279]\nVoc\nmelS\nFF\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICASSP19\n2018.10\nFloWaveNet [163]\nVoc\nmelS\nFF\n\u2212\u2192wav\nICML19\n2018.11\nUniv.

    "2006.07397": "The DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) Dataset\nBrian Dolhansky, Joanna Bitton, Ben P\ufb02aum, Jikuo Lu,\nRuss Howes, Menglin Wang, Cristian Canton Ferrer\nFacebook AI\nAbstract\nDeepfakes are a recent off-the-shelf manipulation tech-\nnique that allows anyone to swap two identities in a sin-\ngle video.\nIn addition to Deepfakes, a variety of GAN-\nbased face swapping methods have also been published\nwith accompanying code. To counter this emerging threat,\nwe have constructed an extremely large face swap video\ndataset to enable the training of detection models, and or-\nganized the accompanying DeepFake Detection Challenge\n(DFDC) Kaggle competition. Importantly, all recorded sub-\njects agreed to participate in and have their likenesses mod-\ni\ufb01ed during the construction of the face-swapped dataset.\nThe DFDC dataset is by far the largest currently-\nand publicly-available face swap video dataset, with over\n100,000 total clips sourced from 3,426 paid actors, pro-\nduced with several Deepfake, GAN-based, and non-learned\nmethods. In addition to describing the methods used to con-\nstruct the dataset, we provide a detailed analysis of the top\nsubmissions from the Kaggle contest. We show although\nDeepfake detection is extremely dif\ufb01cult and still an un-\nsolved problem, a Deepfake detection model trained only on\nthe DFDC can generalize to real \u201din-the-wild\u201d Deepfake\nvideos, and such a model can be a valuable analysis tool\nwhen analyzing potentially Deepfaked videos.\nTraining,\nvalidation and testing corpuses can be downloaded from\nhttps://ai.facebook.com/datasets/dfdc.\n1. Introduction\nSwapping faces in photographs has a long history, span-\nning over one hundred and \ufb01fty years [7], as \ufb01lm and digital\nimagery have a powerful effect on both individuals and so-\ncietal discourse [15]. Previously, creating fake but convinc-\ning images or video tampering required specialized knowl-\nedge or expensive computing resources [27]. More recently,\na new technology called Deepfakes1 has emerged [29] -\na technology that can produce extremely convincing face-\nswapped videos. Producing a Deepfake does not require\nspecialized hardware beyond a consumer-grade GPU, and\nseveral off-the-shelf software packages for creating Deep-\nfakes have been released. The combination of these factors\nhas lead to an explosion in their popularity, both in terms of\nproducing parody videos for entertainment, and for use in\ntargeted attacks against individuals or institutions [9].\nWith the understanding that it is now possible for a mem-\nber of the general public to automatically create convinc-\ning fake face-swapped videos with simple hardware, the\nneed for creating automated detection methods becomes\nclear [2]. While digital forensics experts can analyze sin-\ngle, high-impact videos for evidence of manipulation, this\n1The term \u201dDeepfake\u201d has multiple de\ufb01nitions, but we de\ufb01ne a Deep-\nfake as a video containing a swapped face and produced with a deep neural\nnetwork. This is constrasted with so-called \u201dcheapfakes\u201d - if a fake video\nwas produced with machine learning, it is a Deepfake, whereas if it was\ncreated with widely-available software with no learning component, it is a\ncheapfake [21].\n1\narXiv:2006.07397v4  [cs.CV]  28 Oct 2020\ncannot scale to reviewing each of the hundreds of thousands\nof videos uploaded to Internet or social media platforms ev-\nery day. Detecting Deepfakes at scale necessitates scalable\nmethods, and computer vision or multimodal models are\nparticularly suited to this challenge. However, these models\nrequire training data, and even though it is possible to cre-\nate several convincing Deepfakes easily, the cost of produc-\ning the hundreds of thousands of Deepfake videos neces-\nsary to train these models is often cost prohibitive. In order\nto accelerate advancements in the state of the art of Deep-\nfake detection, we have constructed and publicly released\nthe largest Deepfake detection dataset to date.\nOur \ufb01rst major contribution is the DeepFake Detection\nChallenge (DFDC) Dataset.\nMotivated primarily by the\nfact that many previously-released datasets contained few\nvideos with few subjects and with a limited size and number\nof methods represented, we wanted to release a dataset with\na large number of clips, of varying quality, and with a good\nrepresentation of current state of the art face swap methods.\nFurthermore, as we observed that many publicly-released\ndatasets [14, 17, 18, 23, 30] did not guarantee that their sub-\njects were willing participants or agreed to have their faces\nmodi\ufb01ed, we solicited video data from 3,426 paid actors\nand actresses speaking in a variety of settings for roughly 15\nminutes each. All participants agreed to appear in a dataset\nwhere their faces may be manipulated by a computer vision\nalgorithm. The DFDC Dataset is both the largest currently-\navailable Deepfake dataset, and one of only a handful of\ndatasets containing footage recorded speci\ufb01cally for use in\nmachine learning tasks (the others being the much smaller\nGoogle Deepfake Detection Dataset [6] and the preview\nversion of this dataset [5]).\nBeyond building and releasing a dataset, our second ma-\njor contribution is a now-completed benchmark competition\nusing this data2, and the resulting analysis. The bene\ufb01ts of\na competition of this size are many. First, the monetary\nprizes provided a large incentive for experts in computer\nvision or Deepfake detection to dedicate time and computa-\ntional resources to train models for benchmarking. Second,\nhosting a public competition obviates the need for the au-\nthors of a paper to train and test a model on a dataset they\nproduced. Releasing a dataset and a benchmark simultane-\nously can introduce bias, as the creators of a dataset have\nintimate knowledge of what methods were used while con-\nstructing the dataset. Third, gathering thousands of submis-\nsions and running them against real Deepfake videos that\nparticipants never see paints an extremely accurate picture\nof the true Deepfake detection state of the art.\nFigure 1: Comparison of current Deepfake datasets. Both\naxes are shown in log scale - the DFDC is over an or-\nder of magnitude larger than any other available dataset,\nboth in terms of the number of frames and number of\nvideos.\nRough boundaries for dataset \u201dgeneration\u201d (as\ngiven in [18]) also shown. Overlapping circles do not in-\ndicate inclusion; circle sizes are merely a visualization of\nthe number of fake identities present in the dataset.\n2. Previous work\nDue to the nature of the pairwise auto-encoder style\nmodel used to produce the majority of Deepfake videos,\nand due to limited availability of source footage, previous\ndatasets contain few videos and fewer subjects. Speci\ufb01cally,\nevery pairwise swap between two identities requires retrain-\ning a single model, which in modern hardware takes about\none day on a single GPU. However, as noted in [23], the\nscale of a dataset in terms of raw training videos or frames\nis critical to a detector\u2019s performance.\nLi et al. [18] break down previous datasets into two\nbroad categories - \ufb01rst generation datasets such as DF-\nTIMIT [17], UADFV [30], and FaceForensics++ DF (FF++\nDF) [23], and the second generation, containing datasets\nsuch as the Google DeepFake Detection Dataset [6], Celeb-\nDF [18], and the DFDC Preview Dataset [5]. In general,\neach generation improves over the previous one by increas-\ning the number of frames or videos by an order of magni-\ntude. However, the datasets in the \ufb01rst two generations all\nsuffer from a small number of swapped identities, which\ncan contribute to over\ufb01tting on those particular identities.\n2https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge\n2\nTable 1: Quantitative comparison of various Deepfake datasets\nDataset\nUnique\nfake videos\nTotal\nvideos\nUnclear\nrights\nAgreeing\nsubjectsa\nTotal\nsubjects\nMethods\nNo. perturb.\nNo.\nbenchmarksb\nDF-TIMIT [17]\n640\n960\n\u0015\n0\n43\n2\n-\n4\nUADFV [30]\n49\n98\n\u0015\n0\n49\n1\n-\n6\nFF++ DF [23]\n4,000\n5,000\n\u0015\n0\n?\n4\n2\n19\nGoogle DFD [6]\n3,000\n3,000\n\u0013\n28\n28\n5\n-\n-\nCeleb-DF [18]\n5,639\n6,229\n\u0015\n0\n59\n1\n-\n-\nDeeperForensics-1.0 [14]\n1,000\n60,000\n\u0015\n100\n100\n1\n7c\n5\nDFDC Preview[5]\n5,244\n5,244\n\u0013\n66\n66\n2\n3\n3\nDFDC\n104,500\n128,154\n\u0013\n960\n960\n8d\n19\n2,116\na The number of subjects who agreed to usage of their images and videos.\nb The number of publicly-available benchmark scores, from unique models or individuals. Due to the dif\ufb01culty in \ufb01nding all uses of a dataset, the\nscores must be in a centrally-located place (e.g. a paper or leaderboard).\nc The DF-1.0 paper counts different perturbation parameters as unique. Our augmentations take real number ranges, making this number essentially\nin\ufb01nite, so we only count unique augmentations, regardless of parameters.\nd Different methods can be combined with other methods; for simplicity our 8 methods are DF-128, DF-256, MM/NN, NTH, FSGAN, StyleGAN,\nre\ufb01nement, and audio swaps.\nIn all cases, apart from (possibly) FF++ DF, there are fewer\nthan 100 unique identities. The FF++ DF dataset indexes\nby video sequence rather than ID, so it is unclear how many\nunique IDs appear in the dataset.\nFinally, we propose a third generation of datasets that not\nonly have more than an order of magnitude larger number\nof frames and videos than the second generation, and with\nbetter quality, but also with agreement from individuals ap-\npearing in the dataset. This generation would include the\nDFDC, as well as the recent DeeperForensics-1.0 (DF-1.0)\ndataset [14]. We believe that future face-swapped datasets\nshould seek agreement from individual participants in order\nto be useful to and ethical for the research community.\nFirst generation: Datasets in this generation usually\ncontain less than 1,000 videos and less than 1 million\nframes. In addition, these datasets generally do not rep-\nresent that they have the rights to the underlying content or\nagreement from individuals in the dataset. UADFV, DF-\nTIMIT, FaceForensics++ all contain videos sourced from\nYouTube and perform face swaps between public individu-\nals. Additionally, due to the small scale, models trained on\ndatasets such as FaceForensics++ usually do not generalize\nto real Deepfake videos [19].\nSecond generation: These datasets generally contain\nbetween 1 and 10 thousand videos and 1 and 10 million\nframes, and contain videos with better perceptual quality\nthan videos in the \ufb01rst generation. The Celeb-DF dataset\ncontains over an order of magnitude more data than previ-\nous datasets, but contains data with use restrictions. During\nthis generation, ethical concerns of subjects appearing in a\ndataset without their consent were publicly raised [26]. As\na response, the preview version of this dataset, with con-\nsenting actors, was released. Shortly thereafter, the similar\nGoogle-DFD Dataset was also released, and also contained\n28 paid actors. However, the datasets in this generation also\ndo not contain enough identities that allow for suf\ufb01cient de-\ntection generalization.\nThird generation: The most recent DeepFake datasets,\nDeeperForensics-1.0 and the DFDC Dataset, contain tens of\nthousands of videos and tens of millions of frames. The en-\ncouraging trend of using paid actors has continued for both\nof these datasets. However, there are many major differ-\nences between DF-1.0 and the DFDC Dataset, and as DF-\n1.0 is the most similar dataset to the DFDC dataset, they are\ncovered in detail.\nFirst, although it is claimed that all videos in DF-1.0 con-\ntain consenting individuals, the target videos in the released\ndataset are all sourced from the internet, and whether these\nvideos can be used freely is unclear. In addition, we do not\ncount a fake video and the same fake video with a pertur-\nbation as two separate fake videos, as is done in DF-1.0, as\nthese perturbations are trivial to add and do not require large\nscale computing resources. Every one of the 100,000 fake\nvideos in the DFDC Dataset is a unique target/source swap.\nIgnoring perturbations, DF-1.0 only contains 1,000 unique\nfake videos.\nFurthermore, there are several notable differences be-\nsides raw numbers that have implications for the general-\nization performance of models trained on these datasets.\nThe \ufb01rst is in the nature of the source data. DeeperForen-\nsics contains videos recorded in a controlled, studio setting,\nwhile the DFDC Dataset contains videos of individuals in\nindoor and outdoor settings, in a variety of real-world light-\ning conditions. The methods used to generate our dataset\nare \ufb02exible enough to handle this variety, and do not require\nfrontally-captured videos taken in a studio. In addition, the\nDF-1.0 training dataset only contains videos produced by a\nsingle model that is proposed by the authors (and thus has\nnot been used to create any public Deepfake videos), limit-\ning the applicability of training on this set.\n3\nFinally, in order to avoid the bias introduced by knowing\nhow our manipulated data was produced, we do not pro-\npose any detection model trained speci\ufb01cally on our data,\nand instead solicited the community to contribute models\nthat run on a hidden test set. Therefore, we constructed\nboth a public test set (containing 4,000 videos) and a pri-\nvate test set (containing 10,000 videos), and included real\n\u201din-the-wild\u201d Deepfakes. DF-1.0 uses a hidden test set of\n400 videos, but it is not clear how many are real or fake or\neven whether or not they are Deepfaked videos. Finally, the\nperturbations used in DF-1.0 to expand the original set of\n1,000 fake videos only contain basic pixel-level distortions\nsuch as color changes and Gaussian noise, and no semantic\ndistractors that are present in real videos.\n3. DFDC Dataset\n3.1. Source data\nMany Deepfake or face swap datasets consist of footage\ntaken in non-natural settings, such as news or brie\ufb01ng\nrooms. More worryingly, the subjects in these videos may\nnot agreed to have their faces manipulated.\nWith this understanding, we did not construct our dataset\nfrom publicly-available videos. Instead, we commissioned\na set of videos to be taken of individuals who agreed to be\n\ufb01lmed, to appear in a machine learning dataset, and to have\ntheir face images manipulated by machine learning mod-\nels.\nIn order to re\ufb02ect the potential harm of Deepfaked\nvideos designed to harm a single, possibly non-public per-\nson, videos were shot in a variety of natural settings without\nprofessional lighting or makeup, (but with high-resolution\ncameras, as resolution can be easily downgraded).\nThe\nsource data consisted of:\n1. 3,426 subjects in total with an average of 14.4 videos\neach, with most videos shot in 1080p\n2. 48,190 total videos that average 68.8s each - a total of\n38.4 days of footage\n3. Over 25 TB of raw data\nThe source videos were pre-processed with an internal\nface tracking and alignment algorithm, and all face frames\nwere cropped, aligned, and resized to 256x256 pixels. For\nDeepfake methods, a subsample of 5,000 face frames col-\nlected from all videos was used to train models.\n3.2. Methods\nThroughout this section, the terms target and source are\nused. In general, target refers to the base video in which\na face will be swapped; source refers to the source content\nthat is used to extract the identity that will be swapped onto\nthe target video. For example, for face swapping, we wish to\nput the source face onto the target face, resulting in a video\nidentical to the target video, but with the source identity.\nAll of the face-swapped videos in the dataset were cre-\nated with one of N methods. The set of models selected\nwere designed to cover some of the most popular face swap-\nping methods at the time the dataset was created. In addi-\ntion, some methods with less-realistic results were included\nin order to represent low-effort Deepfakes.\nThe number\nof videos per-method are not equal; the majority of face-\nswapped videos were created with the Deepfake Autoen-\ncoder (DFAE). This choice was made as to re\ufb02ect the distri-\nbution of public Deepfaked videos, which are usually cre-\nated with off-the-shelf software like DeepFaceLab3 or other\npublic repositories used for creating Deepfakes. For a full\ndescription of each model\u2019s architecture, please refer to the\nAppendix.\nDFAE: The DFAE model does not have a consistent\nname or design in public versions, but it is generally struc-\ntured like a typical convolutional autoencoder model with\nseveral small but important differences. First, the model\nuses one shared encoder, but two separately-trained de-\ncoders, one for each identity in the swap.\nAdditionally,\nthe shared portion of the encoder extends one layer beyond\nthe bottleneck, and the upscaling functions used are typi-\ncally PixelShuf\ufb02e operators, which is a non-standard, non-\nlearned function that maps channels in one layer to spatial\ndimensions in the next layer. This architecture encourages\nthe encoder to learn common features across both identities\n(like lighting and pose), while each decoder learns identity-\nspeci\ufb01c features. At inference time, a given input identity in\na frame is run through the opposite decoder, thus producing\na realistic swap. The model is \ufb02exible; in the DFDC dataset,\nwe included models that used an input/output resolution of\n128x128 and 256x256. All of the images in the banner are\nfake faces, produced by a DFAE at 128x128 input/output\nresolution.\nMM/NN face swap: The next method performed swaps\nwith a custom frame-based morphable-mask model. Facial\nlandmarks in the target image and source image are com-\nputed, and the pixels from the source image are morphed to\nmatch the landmarks in the target image using the method\ndescribed in [13]. The eyes and the mouth are copied from\nthe original videos using blending techniques, and spher-\nical harmonics are used to transfer the illumination. This\nmethod works best when both the target and source face ex-\npressions are similar, so we used a nearest-neighbors ap-\nproach on the frame landmarks in order to \ufb01nd the best\nsource/target face pair. In a video, this approach is imme-\ndiately evident, but on a frame-per-frame basis, the results\nlook more realistic and could fool detectors that only oper-\nate on individual frames.\n3https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab\n4\nFigure 2: The fake faces in the top row were post-processed\nwith a sharpening \ufb01lter, resulting in the images in the bot-\ntom row.\nWe included three additional models based on methods\nthat incorporate GANs - the Neural Talking Heads (NTH)\nmodel, FSGAN, and a method utilizing StyleGAN.\nNTH: The NTH [31] model is able to generate realis-\ntic talking heads of people in few- and one-shot learning\nsettings. It consists of two distinct training stages: a meta-\nlearning stage and a \ufb01ne-tuning stage. In the meta-learning\nstage, the model learns meta-parameters by transforming\nlandmark positions into realistic-looking talking heads with\na handful of training images of that person.\nIn the \ufb01ne\ntuning stage, both the generator and the discriminator are\ninitialized with meta-parameters and quick coverage to the\nstate that generate realistic and personalized images after\nseeing a couple of images of a new person.\nA pre-trained model is \ufb01ne-tuned with pairs of videos in\nthe raw DFDC set: the land marking positions are extracted\nfrom the driving video and fed into the generator to produce\nimages with the appearance of the person in the other video.\nFSGAN: The FSGAN method (fully described in [20])\nuses GANs to perform face swapping (and reenactment) of\na source identity onto a target video, accounting for pose\nand expression variations.\nFSGAN applies an adversar-\nial loss to generators for reenactment and inpainting, and\ntrains additional generators for face segmentation and Pois-\nson blending. For the DFDC, we generated FSGAN swap\nvideos using generator checkpoints trained on the data de-\nscribed in [20], after performing brief \ufb01ne-tuning on the\nreenactment generator for each source identity.\nStyleGAN: The StyleGAN [16] method is modi\ufb01ed to\nproduce a face swap between a given \ufb01xed identity descrip-\ntor onto a video by projecting this descriptor on the latent\nface space. This process is executed for every frame.\nRe\ufb01nement: Finally, a random selection of videos went\nthrough post processing. Using a simple sharpening \ufb01lter on\nthe blended faces greatly increased the perceptual quality in\nthe \ufb01nal video with nearly no additional cost, as shown in\nFigure 2.\n3.2.1\nAudio\nIn addition to these face-swapping methods, we also per-\nformed audio swapping on some video clips using the TTS\nSkins voice conversion method detailed in [22]. Video clips\nwere selected for audio swapping independent of whether\nthey were Deepfakes, or which face-swapping method was\nused. The voice identity used to swap did not depend on the\nface identity used in a swap. Although these audio manip-\nulations were not considered \u2019Deepfakes\u2019 for the competi-\ntion, we included them in the set to provide more breadth\nof manipulation type, and they may be of use in further re-\nsearch.\n3.3. Training\nAll subjects were split into one of four sets: training,\nvalidation, public test, or private test. The training and vali-\ndation sets were released publicly, while the public and pri-\nvate test sets were not released, as they were used to rank\nthe \ufb01nal scores of all submissions to the Kaggle contest.\nNot all possible pairs were trained. For example, an ini-\ntial set of 857 subjects were selected into the training set,\nand there are over 360,000 potential pairings within this\ngroup. Training all pairs would require almost 1,000 GPU-\nyears, assuming that it takes one day to train a DFAE model\non one GPU. Instead, within a set, subjects were paired\nwith those with similar appearances, as this tended to give\nbetter results for models like the DFAE. Over 800 GPUs\nwere used to train 6,683 pairwise models (which required\n18 GPU-years), as well the more \ufb02exible models such as\nNTH or FSGAN that only required a small amount of \ufb01ne-\ntuning per subject. Finally, a subset of 10 second clips were\nselected from the output of all models, and the overall dis-\ntribution of gender and appearance was balanced across all\nsets and videos.\n3.4. Post processing\nAfter inference, all methods produced a cropped image\ncontaining the face at 256x256 resolution. However, some\nmethods do not infer details around the face, such as hair\nor background information. Therefore, we re-blended the\nface onto the original full-resolution raw frame using sev-\neral steps, and combined the original raw frames and audio\nwith ffmpeg.\nFirst, we created a face mask using detected landmarks.\nThe mask produced by these landmarks included the fore-\nhead region - many off-the-shelf algorithms only use a mask\nthat extends to the eyebrow region, but this can lead to\nblending artifacts where \u201ddouble eyebrows\u201d appear in the\n\ufb01nal video. Next, we blended the face using the mask onto\nthe original frame using Poisson blending. However, we did\nnot use Poisson blending over the entire mask, as this would\noften blend the two identities and create an \u201daverage\u201d face\n5\nrather than a face that looks like the source subject. Instead,\nwe only blended a small region along the edges of the mask.\nPractically, this was done using a set of morphological oper-\nations that extracted the mask border, applying a Gaussian\n\ufb01lter to the mask border pixels, and \ufb01nally Poisson blending\nthe original and swapped face frames using this transformed\nmask.\nFinally, it is important to note that proper face align-\nment enhanced the quality of all methods. Having each face\naligned at a similar scale allowed models to focus on the de-\ntails of a face, rather than having to rotate or translate mis-\naligned faces.\nIn addition, consistent alignment reduced\nface jitter in the \ufb01nal videos, which is usually a telltale sign\nthat a video was Deepfaked. Faces were aligned by using a\ntriangular set of positions formed by the two eyes and the\nnose, and computing an af\ufb01ne transform that best aligned a\ngiven face with these positions.\n3.5. Dataset contents\nTraining set: The training set provided was comprised\nof 119,154 ten second video clips containing 486 unique\nsubjects. Of the total amount of videos, 100,000 clips con-\ntained Deepfakes which translates to approximately 83.9%\nof the dataset being synthetic videos. In order to create the\nDeepfakes, the DFAE, MM/NN face swap, NTH, and FS-\nGAN methods were used. No augmentations were applied\nto these videos.\nValidation: The validation set is the public test set used\nto compute the public leaderboard positions in the Kaggle\ncompetition.\nThis dataset consisted of 4,000 ten second\nvideo clips, in which 50% (2000 clips) included Deepfakes.\n214 unique subjects were used, none of which were a part\nof the training set. Additionally, the dataset included one\nunseen generation method for Deepfakes: StyleGAN. Aug-\nmentations were applied to roughly 79% of all videos.\nTest: The private test set used was comprised of 10,000\nten second clips.\nSimilar to the public test set, 50% of\nthe clips included Deepfakes and the other 50% were non-\nDeepfaked clips. However, unlike the public test set, 50%\nof this dataset includes organic content found on the internet\nand the other 50% is unseen content from our source video\ndataset, collected from various sources. We are releasing\nthe DFDC-like data portion from the private test set as the\n\ufb01nal test set.\nThe half of the \ufb01nal evaluation test set consisting of\nDFDC videos was assembled using 260 unique subjects\nfrom the source video dataset that have not been seen be-\nfore. The data was constructed identically to our public test\nset, including all listed model types except for StyleGAN.\nAugmentations were applied to approximately 79% of all\nvideos in the \ufb01nal evaluation test set. New, never-before-\nseen augmentations were applied including a dog mask and\na \ufb02ower crown \ufb01lter.\nTraining, validation and testing corpuses can be down-\nloaded from http://ai.facebook.com (URL to be\nupdated).\n3.6. Augmentations\nVarious augmentations such as geometric transforms or\ndistractors were added to the videos in both the public Kag-\ngle test set as well as the \ufb01nal evaluation test set. We de\ufb01ned\ntwo overarching types of augmentations:\n1. Distractor: overlays various kinds of objects (includ-\ning images, shapes, and text) onto a video\n2. Augmenter: applies geometric and color transforms,\nframe rate changes, etc. onto a video\nAugmenters were randomly applied to approximately\n70% of the videos and are fairly straightforward trans-\nforms. The following types of augmenters were applied,\nall at randomly chosen levels: Gaussian blurring, bright-\nening/darkening, adding contrast, altering the framerate,\nconverting to grayscale, horizontal \ufb02ipping, audio removal,\nadding noise, altering the encoding quality, altering the res-\nolution, and rotating. All augmenters were present in both\nthe public and \ufb01nal test sets, except for the grayscale aug-\nmenter which was only present in the \ufb01nal evaluation test\nset.\nAbout 30% of all videos contained distractors, some be-\ning more adversarial than others. The simplest distractors\noverlay random text, shapes, and dots onto each frame of\na video and move around frame to frame. There can either\nbe consistent movement (i.e. moving across horizontally or\nvertically) or random movement. The next subset of dis-\ntractors overlay images onto each frame of a video. Similar\nto the previous subset, there can either be consistent or ran-\ndom movement. Additionally, there is an option to have the\nsame image moving around the entire video, or the option to\nchoose a random image every frame. Some of the added im-\nages included faces from the DFDC dataset. The last subset\nof distractors are facial \ufb01lters that are commonly used on\nsocial media platforms. The facial \ufb01lters implemented were\nthe dog and \ufb02ower crown \ufb01lters.\nAll distractors were present in the \ufb01nal evaluation test\nset, however only the text, shapes, and faces distractors\nwere present in the public Kaggle test set. The Deepfake\nYouTube channels logo distractor was only applied to be-\nnign videos in order to detect if any models were over\ufb01tting\nto YouTube data, which was not allowed by the competi-\ntion\u2019s rules. See Figure 3 for visual examples of the aug-\nmentations.\n6\nFigure 3: A sample frame containing the various augmentations that were applied to the videos. Top row (from left to right):\noriginal, brightness, contrast, a logo overlay. Second row: dog \ufb01lter, dots overlay, faces overlay, and \ufb02ower crown \ufb01lter.\nThird row: grayscale, horizontal \ufb02ip, noise, and images overlay. Bottom row: shapes overlay, encoding quality level change,\nrotation, and text overlay. Not pictured: blur, framerate change, audio removal, and resolution change.\n4. Metrics\nIn most analyses of a machine learning model\u2019s perfor-\nmance, classi\ufb01cation metrics such as log-loss are reported.\nIn certain settings, this type of metric may be appropriate.\nFor instance, a model trained to classify whether or not a\nvideo is a Deepfake may have its input pre-\ufb01ltered by ex-\nperts who want to use the model\u2019s score as an additional\npiece of evidence when performing a forensic analysis on a\nvideo.\nHowever, in many other settings, especially those in\nwhich an entity wants to \ufb01nd faked videos from a large set\nof input videos, detection metrics are more appropriate. In\nthis case, it is important to create metrics that re\ufb02ect the\ntrue prevalence (or the percentage of true positives) of a\ngiven type of fake video. In realistic distributions, the ratio\nof Deepfaked videos to real videos may be less than one in\na million. With such an extreme class imbalance, accuracy\nis not as relevant as the precision or false positive rate of a\nmodel - the number of false positives of even an extremely\naccurate model will outnumber the true positives, thus de-\ncreasing the utility of the detection model.\nWeighted PR\nIf we assume that the ratio between Deepfake and unaltered\nvideos is 1 : x in organic traf\ufb01c and 1 : y in a Deepfakes\ndataset, it is likely that x \u226by. Given the large number\nof true negatives, it is important for an automatic detection\nmodel to be precise. Even a model with high accuracy will\ndetect many more false positives than true positives, sim-\nply because of the large class imbalance, which diminishes\nthe utility of a automatic detection model. Metrics like the\nF\u03b2 score (which does not weight false positives) or even\nthe false positive rate (which only measures the tradeoff be-\ntween true negatives and false positives) do not capture this\nissue. Instead, precision (or its inverse, the false discovery\nrate) is the most indicative metric for how a detection model\nwill perform over a real distribution of videos. However, it\nis not practical to construct a dataset that mimics the statis-\ntics of organic traf\ufb01c due to the sheer number of videos.\nWe can de\ufb01ne a weighted precision for a Deepfakes\ndataset as a very rough approximation of the precision that\nwould be computed by evaluating on a dataset equal in size\nto the magnitude of organic traf\ufb01c. Assuming the ratios of\nunaltered to tampered videos differ between a test dataset\nand organic traf\ufb01c by a factor of \u03b1 = x/y, we de\ufb01ne\n7\nFigure 4: The average log loss for each augmenter and distractor. As expected, videos containing the noise and faces\naugmentations were among the most dif\ufb01cult to predict accurately. Surprisingly however, the \ufb02ower \ufb01lter, which only covers\na portion of the forehead, was the most dif\ufb01cult distractor while the dog \ufb01lter, which covers the nose and mouth, was one of\nthe easier ones to predict. Horizontal \ufb02ips, blurring, and rotation were among the easiest augmenters, likely due to the fact\nthat they are common data augmentations. Note that videos that contained both augmenters and distractors were excluded\nfrom this analysis.\nweighted precision wP and (standard) recall R as\nwP =\nTP\nTP + \u03b1FP,\nR =\nTP\nTP + FN,\n(1)\nwhere TP, FP, and FN signify true positives, false positives,\nand false negatives. This metric differs from the F\u03b2 score,\nas it assigns a weight to false positives instead of false neg-\natives (and ignores true negatives). For an example applied\nto submissions in the DFDC, see Figure 9.\nFor the purposes of ranking submissions in the DFDC\nCompetition, models were ranked by log loss, as the\nweighted PR metric can be extremely small and somewhat\nnoisy. In addition, we only needed a relative measure of per-\nformance to rank competitors, rather than an absolute mea-\nsure. However, in Section 6, we report weighted PR metrics\nin addition to log loss to assess each model\u2019s performance\nas a detector on a realistic distribution of videos.\n5. Results\nAs we do not introduce any novel architectures, in this\nsection we describe how well different models and methods\nperform in practice, and show some of the best and worst\nexamples of each method. Unlike other work in this area,\nwe explicitly do not show the worst examples from datasets\nother than the DFDC Dataset as a comparison, as (a) it is\nsimple to cherry-pick the worst examples from a distribu-\ntion of data produced by automatic methods, and (b) the per-\nceptual quality of a moving video cannot be demonstrated\nwith individual still frames. Instead, we believe that produc-\ning a very large dataset that covers a wide range of output\nqualities and with many unique videos is more useful than\na hand-tuned, high-quality dataset of limited size.\nIn general, face swaps produced with DFAE methods\nwere of higher quality over a wider range of videos than\nswaps produced with GAN-like methods, and required\nmuch less \ufb01ne tuning.\nOur hypothesis is that GAN-like\nmethods work well in limited settings with even light-\ning, such as news rooms, interviews, or controlled-capture\nvideos as in [14], but do not work well automatically (yet).\nBeyond ease of use, this may explain why most public\nDeepfake videos are produced with DFAE methods. Con-\nsequently, the majority of videos in the DFDC Dataset were\nproduced with several different DFAE variants.\nSome qualitative results from each method are shown in\nFigure 5, with further discussion here.\nMM/NN: While this method was able to produce con-\nvincing single frame images, overall the NN approach\ntended to produce discontinuities in the face. In addition,\nthere was sometimes a failure in the mask \ufb01tting, as seen in\nthe left image of the top row of Figure 5.\nDFAE: The DFAE methods were generally the most\n\ufb02exible and produced the best results out of the methods\nincluded in this paper. They were able to handle a variety\nof lighting conditions and individuals with good temporal\ncoherence, even though inference happened on a frame-by-\nframe basis. Particular areas of weakness were glasses and\nextreme poses.\nFSGAN: The FSGAN was able to produce convinc-\ning results in scenes with good lighting, but struggled to\nmaintain an even skin tone in darker settings. In addition,\n8\nFigure 5: A selection of results of varying quality, where each row corresponds to a method (from top-to-bottom, MM/NN,\nDFAE, FSGAN, NTH, StyleGAN), and each column shows increasing quality from left to right. For a more detailed overview,\nsee Section 5.\nit tended to produce \ufb02at-looking results.\nOne particular\nstrength of this method is in handling extreme head poses,\nas shown in the rightmost image of row 3 of Figure 5.\nNTH: Of the GAN like methods, this method produced\nthe most consistent quality.\nHowever, it tended to in-\nsert similar looking eyes across subjects, regardless of the\nsource ID. Like other GAN methods, NTH did not produce\ngood results in darker settings.\nStyleGAN: Overall, StyleGAN produced the worst over-\nall results, both at the frame level and at the video level.\nBy far the most common in issue in videos was an uncon-\nstrained eye gaze. Without conditioning on the input gaze,\nthe gaze of the swapped face tender to wander, with eyes\nlooking in different directions at once. In addition, Style-\nGAN had trouble matching the illumination in a scene.\n6. Large scale benchmarking\nThe second component of this work involved a large pub-\nlic competition, where participants submitted Deepfake de-\ntection models trained on the full DFDC Dataset. Initially,\nthe public test set was used to rank the public leaderboard\nwhile the competition was ongoing.\nThis set only con-\ntained DFDC videos with subjects that never appeared in\nthe dataset. The \u201dprivate\u201d test set included real videos, some\nof which were Deepfakes, in addition to more DFDC videos\nthat contained even more subjects that hadn\u2019t appeared in\n9\nany previous set. Participants were free to use additional\nexternal data, as long as it complied to the policies of the\ncompetition.\nThe following analysis presents a comprehensive snap-\nshot of the current performance of Deepfake detectors, and\nin particular, the performance against the private test set\ngives an idea as to how the best models would perform on a\nreal video distribution.\n6.1. Meta analysis\nDuring the course of the competition, 2,114 teams par-\nticipated. Teams were allowed to submit two different sub-\nmissions for \ufb01nal evaluation. Of all of the scores on the\nprivate test set, 60% of submissions had a log loss lower\nthan or equal to 0.69, which is roughly the score if one were\nto predict a probability of 0.5 for every video. As seen in\nFigure 8, many submissions were simply random. Good\nperformance on the public test set correlated with good per-\nformance on the private test set, as shown in the \ufb01rst image\nof Figure 6.\nFigure 6: Correlation between the average precision of sub-\nmitted models for DFDC and real videos.\nAll \ufb01nal evaluations were performed on the private test\nset, using a single V100 GPU. Submissions had to run over\nall 10,000 videos in the private test set within 90 hours, but\nmost submissions \ufb01nished evaluating all videos within 10\ntotal hours, giving a rough average inference time of around\n3.6s per-video.\n6.2. Analysis of submitted models\nAfter the competition ended, all scores for all submis-\nsions were computed over all videos in the private test set.\nShown in Figure 7 are detection metrics computed over the\nentire private set, only on videos from the DFDC, and only\non real videos. As expected, the best models achieved very\ngood detection performance on DFDC videos, as the all of\nthe videos in the training set came from this distribution.\nOn real videos, there was an expected performance drop,\nbut the best models achieved an average precision of 0.753\nand a ROC-AUC score of 0.734, only on real videos, which\ndemonstrates that training on the DFDC Dataset allows a\nmodel to generalize to real videos.\nThe second and third plots in \ufb01gure 6 show the correla-\ntion between detection metrics computed on DFDC videos\nonly and scores on real videos only, providing additional\nevidence that good performance on the DFDC dataset trans-\nlates to good performance on real videos, and consequently\nthat the DFDC dataset is a valuable resource for training\nreal Deepfake detection models.\nFinally, we provide a brief description of the top-5 win-\nning solutions here - more detailed analysis of each ap-\nproach can be found at the accompanying reference for\neach model. The \ufb01rst submission, Selim Seferbekov [24],\nused MTCNN [33] for face detection and an Ef\ufb01cientNet\nB-7 [28] for feature encoding.\nStructured parts of faces\nwere dropped during training as a form of augmentation.\nThe second solution, WM [34], used the Xception [3] archi-\ntecture for frame-by-frame feature extraction, and a WS-\nDAN [12] model for augmentation. The third submission,\nNTechLab [4], used an ensemble of Ef\ufb01cientNets in addition\nto using the mixup [32] augmentation during training. The\nfourth solution, Eighteen Years Old [25], used an ensemble\nof frame and video models, including Ef\ufb01cientNet, Xcep-\ntion, ResNet [10], and a SlowFast [8] video-based network.\nIn addition, they tailored a score fusion strategy speci\ufb01cally\nfor the DFDC dataset. Finally, the \ufb01fth winning solution,\nThe Medics [11], also used MTCNN for face detection, as\nwell as an ensemble of 7 models, 3 of which were 3D CNNs\n(which performed better than temporal models), including\nthe I3D model [1].\n7. Future work\nThere are three main areas of future work regarding the\nDFDC Dataset. First, we would like to perform a large scale\nperceptual study of the quality of the videos in the dataset.\nDue to time constraints and extenuating circumstances sur-\nrounding COVID-19, this portion of the project is delayed,\nbut is ongoing. Second, we would like to expand the overall\nsize of the dataset. Only 960 of the roughly 3,500 origi-\nnal identities were included in the dataset, again due to time\nand computational constraints. Finally, we are exploring\n10\nTable 2: Top 5 model results - precision reported at recall levels 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9\nTeam name\nOverall\nlog loss\nDFDC\nlog loss\nReal\nlog loss\nReal\nP@0.1\nReal\nP@0.3\nReal\nP@0.9\nSelim Seferbekov [24]\n0.4279\n0.1983\n0.6605\n0.9803\n0.7610\n0.5389\nWM [34]\n0.4284\n0.1787\n0.6805\n0.9294\n0.6717\n0.5775\nNTechLab [4]\n0.4345\n0.1703\n0.7039\n0.9804\n0.8244\n0.5541\nEighteen Years Old [25]\n0.4347\n0.1882\n0.6831\n0.9843\n0.6329\n0.5625\nThe Medics [11]\n0.4371\n0.2157\n0.6621\n0.9653\n0.7354\n0.5516\nFigure 7: Detection metrics broken down by video type.\nthe possibility of releasing the original raw dataset to the\nresearch community.

    "2408.16132": "SVDD 2024: THE INAUGURAL SINGING VOICE DEEPFAKE DETECTION CHALLENGE\nYou Zhang1, Yongyi Zang1, Jiatong Shi2, Ryuichi Yamamoto3, Tomoki Toda3, Zhiyao Duan1\n1University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA\n2Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA 3Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan\nABSTRACT\nWith the advancements in singing voice generation and the growing\npresence of AI singers on media platforms, the inaugural Singing\nVoice Deepfake Detection (SVDD) Challenge aims to advance re-\nsearch in identifying AI-generated singing voices from authentic\nsingers.\nThis challenge features two tracks: a controlled setting\ntrack (CtrSVDD) and an in-the-wild scenario track (WildSVDD).\nThe CtrSVDD track utilizes publicly available singing vocal data\nto generate deepfakes using state-of-the-art singing voice synthesis\nand conversion systems. Meanwhile, the WildSVDD track expands\nupon the existing SingFake dataset, which includes data sourced\nfrom popular user-generated content websites. For the CtrSVDD\ntrack, we received submissions from 47 teams, with 37 surpassing\nour baselines and the top team achieving a 1.65% equal error rate.\nFor the WildSVDD track, we benchmarked the baselines.

INTRODUCTION\nThe use of AI tools in music production has sparked considerable\ndebate, introducing new issues and challenges [1]. Notably, the de-\nvelopment of advanced singing voice synthesis (SVS) and conver-\nsion (SVC) techniques has reached a significant milestone in AI-\ngenerated songs, where synthesized voices sound remarkably natu-\nral and align seamlessly with music scores. These synthesized voices\ncan now emulate the vocal characteristics of any singer with minimal\ntraining data. While this technological advancement is impressive,\nit has raised widespread concerns among artists, record labels, and\npublishing houses [2]. The potential for unauthorized synthetic re-\nproductions that mimic well-known singers poses a real threat to the\ncommercial value and intellectual property rights of original artists,\nprompting urgent calls for efficient and accurate methods to detect\nthese deepfake singing voices.\nIn response to these concerns, research has emerged towards de-\ntecting AI-generated songs. Our prior research SingFake [3] has\nlaid the groundwork for the emerging field of singing voice deep-\nfake detection (SVDD). We introduced the SingFake dataset, a com-\nprehensive collection of authentic and deepfake song clips featur-\ning a variety of languages and singers. Concurrently, Xie et al. [4]\ncurated FSD, a Chinese fake song detection dataset in a controlled\nsetting. Both works found that speech-trained deepfake detection\nThis work is supported in part by a New York State Center of Excel-\nlence in Data Science award, National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Graduate\nResearch Fellowship Award 15PNIJ-23-GG-01933-RESS, National Science\nFoundation (NSF) grants 1846184 and 2222129, synergistic activities funded\nby NSF grant DGE-1922591, and JST CREST JPMJCR19A3, Japan.\nmodels experience significant performance degradation when tested\non the SVDD task, highlighting the unique challenges brought by\nsynthesized singing voices.\nOur SingFake evaluations [3] highlighted several challenges, in-\ncluding dealing with unseen singers, various communication codecs,\ndiverse languages and musical contexts, and interference from ac-\ncompaniment tracks. This underscores the distinct nature of SVDD\nand the necessity for specialized SVDD systems. SingGraph [5] has\nbeen a novel model that achieves state-of-the-art performance within\nthe SingFake dataset. They utilized an acoustic understanding model\nand speech self-supervised learning (SSL) models, underscoring the\nsynergy between music understanding and voice analysis for SVDD\nin the wild. A recent work [6] proposed a general-purpose music\ndeepfake detector that also includes generated instrumental parts,\nhighlighting robustness and generalization issues.\nTo advance the field of SVDD, we introduce the SVDD chal-\nlenge [7], the inaugural research initiative specifically dedicated\nto exploring SVDD. This challenge targets both controlled and in-\nthe-wild settings, aiming to distinguish bonafide and AI-generated\nsinging voice recordings within CtrSVDD and WildSVDD tracks,\nrespectively.\nFor the CtrSVDD track, we generated a dataset\nCtrSVDD [8] that exclusively uses clean, unaccompanied vocals\nprovided by our data contributors, thereby mitigating the interfer-\nence of voice separation algorithms. This two-track approach allows\nparticipants to tackle the challenges of identifying deepfake singing\nvoices under different and realistic conditions.\nThe WildSVDD\ntrack follows the same approach as our SingFake project [3], dealing\nwith deepfakes as they typically appear in online media, complete\nwith background music.\nThe SVDD challenge has received much attention, and the re-\nsults have been promising. For the CtrSVDD track, we received\nsubmissions from 47 teams, with 37 surpassing our baselines and\nthe top team achieving a 1.65% equal error rate. Common strate-\ngies included self-supervised feature and ensemble models. For the\nWildSVDD track, we have not received any submissions yet, but we\nhave benchmarked the baselines. Future research endeavors can fo-\ncus on improving generalization ability with single systems and fur-\nther exploring in-the-wild scenarios. We look forward to continued\nprogress in this critical area of research.\n2. OVERVIEW OF CHALLENGE SETUPS\n2.1. Two tracks: CtrSVDD and WildSVDD\nFor singing voice deepfakes, these artificial creations are typically\npresented with background music, mirroring the authentic song ex-\nperience. Our previous work on SingFake [3] followed this approach\nby collecting deepfakes from web videos. However, this method in-\ntroduces a significant challenge: the process of separating vocals\nfrom music can create artifacts that obscure the differences between\nbonafide and deepfake vocals.\narXiv:2408.16132v2  [eess.AS]  23 Sep 2024\nTo address the above issues comprehensively, the SVDD chal-\nlenge is structured into two distinct tracks: Controlled (CtrSVDD)\nand In-the-Wild (WildSVDD) settings. The WildSVDD track mir-\nrors the approach of the SingFake project, dealing with deepfakes as\nthey typically appear in online media, including background instru-\nmental interference and sometimes background noises. Conversely,\nthe CtrSVDD track uses clean, unaccompanied vocals provided by\nour data contributors, thereby minimizing the interference caused by\nvoice separation algorithms. The data construction process was de-\nscribed in [8]. We also train deepfake algorithms ourselves and thus\ncan have all metadata of training configurations as well as source and\ntarget utterances. This double-track approach allows participants to\ntackle the challenges of identifying deepfake singing voices under\nboth lab-controlled and realistic conditions.\nFor CtrSVDD, we generate singing vocals with existing SVS\nand SVC systems. The setting mitigates the artifacts by the singing\nvoice separation algorithms, and we expect it to be easier than the\nin-the-wild settings. For WildSVDD, we continued the data collec-\ntion process of SingFake to collect more data from the video plat-\nforms. This collection from the web inevitably introduces additional\ndifficulties in the systematic analysis of SVDD systems due to un-\nknown backend synthesis/conversion systems and post-processing\nstrategies. The compression codecs used by the web platforms are\nalso unknown and may change over time, causing inconsistencies\nacross different downloads.\n2.2. Evaluation metric: EER\nWe expect each SVDD system to generate a score file for every seg-\nmented clip, with higher scores indicating greater confidence that the\nclip is bonafide. The Equal Error Rate (EER) is achieved when the\nfalse acceptance and rejection rates are equal by varying the deci-\nsion threshold, hence EER is independent of the threshold. A lower\nEER indicates a better system for distinguishing between bonafide\nand deepfake singing voices.\n3. CTRSVDD: CONTROLLED SINGING VOICE\nDEEPFAKE DETECTION\n3.1. CtrSVDD database\nTo construct the CtrSVDD database, we first collected bonafide sam-\nples from open-source singing recordings. These include1:\n\u2022 Mandarin datasets: Opencpop [9], M4Singer [10], KiSing [11],\nand the official ACE-Studio release [12].\n\u2022 Japanese datasets: Ofuton-P, Oniku Kurumi, Kiritan [13], and\nJVS-MuSiC [14].\nWe segmented these public dataset recordings into vocal clips. Next,\nwe generated deepfake singing vocals using 14 existing SVS and\nSVC systems, as described in Table 1. The SVS systems employed\nwere ESPnet-Muskits [15], NNSVS [16], DiffSinger [17], and\nACESinger [12]. For SVC, we utilized NU-SVC [18] and variants\nof So-VITS-SVC. Specially for ACESinger, we asked the ACE Stu-\ndio company to provide the bonafide utterances for a list of singers;\nwe then generated deepfake data using the ACE Studio tool.\nThe CtrSVDD database is partitioned into training, develop-\nment, and evaluation splits, following the methodology of the\nASVspoof2019 speech anti-spoofing benchmark. The training and\ndevelopment sets use the same set of deepfake generation algorithms\n1For comprehensive details of CtrSVDD, including links to source\ndatasets and generation methods, please refer to [8].\nTable 1.\nOverview of the deepfake methods included in the\nCtrSVDD database.

The database is released under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license,\naligned with the sourcing corpora.\nWe released the training and\ndevelopment set2 and the evaluation set3, while the keys and labels\nfor the evaluation set were withheld until the submission deadline.\n3.2. Protocols\nNote that the training and development sets available on Zenodo are\nincomplete because of licensing issues with some bonafide datasets.\nTo fully retrieve the dataset, we asked the participants to first down-\nload all the remaining bonafide datasets on their own by agreeing\nto the terms and conditions and then follow the instructions we pro-\nvided4. Participants can refer to the statistics in Table 2 as a guide to\nverify the completion of their downloads and generation.\nParticipants are asked to ask teams to score each vocal clip.\nUsing the submitted scores, we calculate and rank participant sys-\ntems using EER. During our baseline analysis [8], we found the A14\nattack (originated from ACESinger) shows strong out-of-domain\nattributes [8]. As such, we exclude the A14 attack and the bonafide\nutterances of the ACESinger during the official ranking of the\nCtrSVDD track. Firstly, unlike other deepfake attacks (A09-A13)\nthat were trained using open-source datasets, the A14 attack was\ntrained on unknown data sources. Additionally, the bonafide por-\ntion of ACESinger was not used to train the other attack systems\n(A09-A13). The bonafide portion of ACESinger was provided by\nTimedomain, a company that may apply additional processing steps\nto the audio output, while the deepfake portion was generated using\ntheir ACE Studio desktop application.\n3.3. Submission rules\nWe used CodaBench [19] for CtrSVDD results submission. Each\nteam is allowed a maximum of three submissions for the entire du-\nration of the CtrSVDD challenge for official ranking purposes. This\nlimit is in place to ensure fairness and to encourage strategic sub-\nmissions. It is important to note that CodaBench\u2019s daily submis-\n2https://zenodo.org/records/10467648\n3https://zenodo.org/records/12703261\n4https://github.com/SVDDChallenge/CtrSVDD Utils\nsion limit is separate; our three-submission limit refers to the total\nallowable submissions for the challenge. After the three initial sub-\nmissions are used, participants may utilize an additional CodaBench\ndedicated to research. This allows them to submit scores and obtain\nper-attack, per-dataset, and overall EERs for research purposes.\nParticipants are welcome to use any publicly available datasets\nfor training in addition to the CtrSVDD we provide, but of course,\nexclude any datasets used in our test set.\nSpecifically, for the\nCtrSVDD track, participants must not use M4Singer, KiSing, any\nopen-sourced deepfake models based on M4Singer and/or KiSing, or\nthe commercial software ACE Studio [12]. We refer the participants\nto the list of available datasets in the evaluation plan [7].\n3.4. Baseline solutions\nWe have developed two baseline systems for the challenge: one that\nuses raw waveforms and another that employs linear frequency cep-\nstral coefficients (LFCCs) as front-end features: The raw waveform\nsystem is an AASIST [20]-based system. The LFCC system uses\n60 coefficients, with a 512 sample window and 160 sample hop size.\nThe LFCC features pass through several downsampling residual con-\nvolution blocks and a linear layer connecting it to the graph attention\nnetwork backend of [20].\nWe refer to the LFCC system as B01 and the raw waveform\nmodel as B02. For both systems, we conducted training over 100\nepochs using a fixed random seed, exclusively on the CtrSVDD\ntraining partition. We then selected the checkpoint that achieved the\nlowest validation EER on the CtrSVDD development partition for\nevaluation. During training and evaluation, the models processed\n4-second random audio segments from each utterance. Details of the\nimplementation are available on the challenge GitHub repository5.\n4. WILDSVDD: IN-THE-WILD SINGING VOICE\nDEEPFAKE DETECTION\n4.1. WildSVDD database\nWe gathered data annotations from social media platforms follow-\ning a method similar to the SingFake project [3]. The WildSVDD\ndataset has been expanded to approximately double the original size\nof SingFake, now featuring 97 singers with 2007 deepfake and 1216\nbonafide songs. The annotators, who were familiar with the singers\nthey covered, manually verified the user-specified labels during the\nannotation process to ensure accuracy, especially in cases where the\nsinger(s) did not actually perform certain songs. We cross-checked\nthe annotations against song titles and descriptions, and manually\nreviewed any discrepancies for further verification. We verified the\naccessibility of all URLs in the dataset as of March 28th and re-\nmoved any that were inaccessible. The WildSVDD dataset now in-\ncludes Korean singers, making Korean the third most represented\nlanguage in the dataset. To help track changes between the SingFake\nand WildSVDD datasets, we have added a \u201dSingFake Set\u201d column\nthat indicates the original partition of an annotation in the SingFake\ndataset. Annotations that lack a value in this column are new addi-\ntions to the WildSVDD dataset.

Due\nto this variability, self-reported metrics from participants can, at best,\nbe used as a rough reference and cannot be directly used to compare\nsystems. As such, we encourage participants to report the success\nrate of URL downloads per partition and, if possible, the actual files\nused for training and testing. This transparency allows researchers to\nmake fairer comparisons. Additionally, participants are encouraged\nto open source their model implementations to facilitate the repro-\nduction of results with the WildSVDD dataset.\n4.2. Protocols\nWe provide the training and test partitions, allowing participants the\nflexibility to carve out a validation set from the training data for\nmodel development. We provide labels of SingFake [3] partitions\nfor annotations that appeared in the SingFake dataset for easy com-\nparison with previous systems. The test set is divided into parts A\nand B, with part B considered more challenging due to its inclusion\nof unseen musical contexts [3].\nWe recommend that participants further segment the songs into\nclips using our tool available in the SingFake GitHub repository7.\nEvaluations should be conducted at the segment level rather than at\nthe song level. We adopt the self-reported EER and do not accurately\nrank the results. We encourage the participants to submit the score\nfiles listing the URLs, segment start and end timestamps, and the\ncorresponding scores output from their systems.\n4.3. Baseline solutions\nTo establish baseline solutions, we implement the architecture de-\nscribed in [8], applying both mixtures and vocals configurations as\noutlined in [3]. We also incorporate the self-supervised learning\nmodel XLS-R [21] based system proposed in [22], given its pop-\nularity among top performers in the CtrSVDD track. Existing re-\nsearch and CtrSVDD track outcomes indicate that data augmentation\nsignificantly enhances performance with self-supervised frontends.\nConsequently, we present results both with and without augmenta-\ntion. We adhere to the training schedule, learning rate, and optimizer\nspecified in [8], with the exception of XLS-R based models, where\nwe adopt training settings same as [22].\nNotably, we observe that the raw waveform system\u2019s perfor-\nmance on WildSVDD Test B, which is equivalent to SingFake T04,\nshows significant improvement compared to [3], despite highly\nsimilar system architectures. This improvement suggests that data-\ncentric approaches may prove most effective in the long run. The\nmost substantial difference between these two system versions lies\nin the volume of training data available, highlighting the potential\nimpact of increased data resources on model performance.\n7https://github.com/yongyizang/SingFake\n5. CHALLENGE RESULTS\nWe received 89 registration forms, with 84 teams expressing interest\nin participating in the CtrSVDD track and 65 teams showing inter-\nest in the WildSVDD track. Out of these, 47 teams submitted their\nresults to the CtrSVDD track. Unfortunately, we have not received\nany submissions for the WildSVDD track, probably due to time con-\nstraints and copyright concerns.\n5.1. CtrSVDD results from the team submissions\nTable 4 presents the results from the CtrSVDD track of the SVDD\nchallenge, ranking the participating teams based on their EER with-\nout ACESinger and providing additional EER values for all attacks.\nMost teams used their three allowed entries for submission, while\nsome did not but still achieved commendable ranks.\nWe ranked\nthe teams based on the best submission (lowest EER) among their\nentries. Among the 47 submissions (excluding two baselines), 37\nsurpassed both baselines, demonstrating substantial progress in de-\nveloping SVDD systems capable of distinguishing between bonafide\nand deepfake singing voices.\nThe baseline systems B01 and B02 achieved EERs of 12.03%\nand 11.16%, respectively. The raw-waveform-based system outper-\nformed the LFCC-based system, which was consistent with observa-\ntions in the speech anti-spoofing task. The top-ranked team achieved\nan impressive EER of 1.65%, significantly lower than the baselines.\nThe top teams\u2019 results were very close, highlighting the competitive\nnature of the challenge. However, several teams\u2019 performances fell\nbetween or even below the baseline results, underscoring the chal-\nlenge\u2019s difficulty. These results emphasize the complexity of SVDD,\nespecially when considering diverse unseen attack methods.\nThe overall EERs that include the ACESinger bonafide portion\nand A14 attack are consistently higher than those that exclude them,\nindicating the difficulty of detecting deepfakes generated from out-\nof-domain commercial SVS systems. While the trend of increasing\nEERs is generally similar, some systems achieved much lower or\nhigher overall EERs than expected. This leads to our detailed analy-\nsis of per-attack EER and per-dataset EER in the next subsection.\n5.2. Per-attack and per-dataset analysis\nFor the per-dataset EER, we calculate the EER based on the meta-\ndata of the source bonafide datasets, specifically identifying which\ndataset the target speaker belongs to. For the per-attack EER, A09-\nA13 is calculated using all bonafide data except ACESinger, along\nwith the deepfake data generated by the corresponding methods. The\nA14 EER is calculated using the ACESinger bonafide portion and\nthe deepfakes generated by the ACE Studio tool, making it identical\nto the per-dataset EER for ACESinger. Note that we used a slightly\ndifferent metric during the challenge but changed post-challenge.\nPreviously, per-attack EERs on A09-A14 were calculated using all\nbonafide song clips against deepfake clips for each category [8],\nwhich could be what was reported by participants.\nTable 5 provides a detailed analysis of the top eight ranked sub-\nmissions. The per-attack results do not show a consistent decline\nacross all attacks as rankings improve. Notably, the performance on\nA11 and A12 suggests that the top-performing systems may not nec-\nessarily be more robust to different types of attacks. This observa-\ntion is consistent with findings in speech anti-spoofing research [23].\nBesides, The systems\u2019 performance on A12 is generally worse com-\npared to other attacks, which is consistent with our baseline analy-\nsis [8]. Furthermore, although the top four systems achieved similar\nTable 4. Summary of the CtrSVDD challenge results. The EER\nwithout ACESinger is used as the evaluation metric to rank the sub-\nmissions, while the EER for all attacks is listed for analysis. The\nrows for both baseline systems are shaded.

The \u201cNBU MISL\u201d sys-\ntem is less robust to KiSing and ACESinger compared to other top\nsystems, dropping to 19th place when ACESinger is factored in.\nA similar phenomenon is evident in the per-dataset results. The\nbest performance on KiSing was achieved by the team \u201cStar\u201d, which\nwas ranked 8th. While KiSing and M4Singer datasets yield overall\nlow EERs, ACESinger consistently produced EERs around 50%, ap-\nproximating random guessing. The performance gap observed with\nACESinger is likely due to inconsistencies between ACESinger and\nthe rest of the CtrSVDD dataset. Notably, two teams achieved 93%\nand 84% on ACESinger, indicating some ability to establish a deci-\nsion boundary on this dataset, albeit with incorrect decisions.\nBoth the per-attack and per-dataset EERs highlight the ongo-\ning challenge of generalization to unseen generation methods and\nacoustic channels. This underscores the need for increasing research\nefforts focused on developing systems that are more robust to these\nout-of-distribution conditions.\nTable 5.

Solution strategies\nAmong all submissions, 8 teams submitted system descriptions, with\ntheir ranks bolded in Table 4. Based on the submitted strategies,\nmost teams utilized self-supervised learning (SSL) frontends and en-\nsemble learning. For features, both raw waveform and SSL features\nwere extensively explored. The most popular SSL feature used is\nwav2vec2 XLSR [21], a cross-lingual representation. Popular back-\nend choices included ResNet and AASIST [20], while score averag-\ning was the favored ensemble method.\nAll the top four teams share similar strategies.\nTheir gen-\neral schemes are illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe top-ranked team,\n\u201cFosafer Speech,\u201d used additional datasets besides CtrSVDD: HiFi-\nTTS [24], OpenSinger [25], CSD [26], itako-Singing, JSUT-Song,\nNamine ritsu utagoe db, no7-singing, PJS [27], PoPCS [17], URS-\ning [28], which are all among the list of allowable external training\ndatasets in our evaluation plan [7]. They also generated additional\ntraining data, nhv share, and made it public8 9, one week before\nthe challenge submission deadline as requested. They fused three\nsubsystems and incorporated adversarial training [29] to improve\n8https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h36C6mWvywIYXSPErDf2tcYfPuRkGKoQ/\n9https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LhbH2-yNe ZHcmTxqS5q7XQYlL1 JM -/\ndomain adaptation in the third system.\nThe team \u201cNBU MISL\u201d\ndeveloped two subsystems focused on low and high frequencies,\nrespectively. Both used feature aggregation from Chinese HuBERT\nand the corresponding frequency band. They augmented the dataset\nwith HiFi-GAN [30] vocoded audio. The team \u201cI2R-ASTAR\u201d devel-\noped five subsystems with various layer aggregation strategies [31]\nand variants of the RawBoost data augmentation method for each\nsubsystem. Please refer to [32] for more details of their system.\nThe team \u201cQishan\u201d developed two subsystems with different SSL\nfeatures. Each subsystem follows a Sensitive Layer Select (SLS)\nclassifier that uses an adaptive weight allocation method [33] to\naggregate SSL features and pool the feature map to a score. The\nscore with a larger absolute value is selected for submission.\nThe team \u201cPindrop\u201d developed three subsystems based on x-\nvector, ResNetSE34, and wav2vec2 XLSR. Additional datasets were\nincorporated. The team \u201cxieyuankun\u201d submitted a single system us-\ning wav2vec2 XLSR combined with AASIST, without any data aug-\nmentation. This approach could serve as an addition to our baseline\nsystems. More systems have been submitted to the research track\nof CodaBench, some of which demonstrate better performance than\ntheir challenge submissions. We look forward to paper submissions\nto learn more about their strategies.\n6. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe CtrSVDD track of the SVDD challenge was a notable success,\nattracting 47 submissions, with 37 surpassing the baseline perfor-\nmance. The top teams employed diverse and advanced techniques,\nsuch as self-supervised learning, ensemble learning, and adversarial\ntraining, demonstrating significant innovation in the field. Detailed\nsystem descriptions from eight teams provided valuable insights for\nfuture research. This success highlights the progress in deepfake de-\ntection for singing voices and sets the stage for further advancements\nand improvements.\nThe lack of submissions for the WildSVDD track can be at-\ntributed to concerns over copyright issues, the complexities of the\ndownload process, and the time-consuming nature of data prepara-\ntion. Additionally, challenges with the reproducibility of baseline\nmethods and the limited time frame may have discouraged partic-\nipation. Teams might have prioritized the CtrSVDD track, where\ntheir efforts would be more recognized and impactful.\nFor future work, the CtrSVDD track can be enhanced by in-\ncluding the latest advancements in SVS and SVC techniques. Ad-\nditionally, cross-database evaluations between the CtrSVDD and\nWildSVDD datasets could be conducted to assess the generalizabil-\nity and robustness of SVDD systems, offering an intriguing research\navenue. Exploring a broader variety of singing deepfake types is\nalso recommended. Given recent advancements in singing genera-\ntive models that can produce not only vocals but also accompanying\nmusic, as noted in [34], it becomes crucial to develop detection\nsystems capable of identifying AI-generated songs in their entirety.\n7.

Consequently, discriminating between real and fake content\nis becoming increasingly more challenging even for humans [41, 77].\nThis opens the door for misuse of content generation technology for\nexample to spread misinformation and commit fraud, rendering the\ndevelopment of reliable detection methods vital.\nThe development of such methods is highly dependent on the\navailable deepfake benchmark datasets, which led to the steady in-\ncrease in the number of publicly available datasets that provide\nexamples of visual-only [28, 35, 38], audio-only [39, 71], and audio-\nvisual [31] content modification strategies (e.g., face-swapping, face-\nreenactment, etc.). However, the majority of these datasets and meth-\nods assume that the entirety of the content (i.e., audio, visual, audio-\nvisual) is either real or fake. This leaves the door open for criminals\nto exploit the embedding of small segments of manipulations in the\notherwise real content. As argued in [6], this type of targeted ma-\nnipulation can lead to drastic changes in the underlying meaning as\nillustrated in Figure 1. Given that most deepfake benchmark datasets\ndo not include this type of partial manipulations, detection methods\nmight fail to perform reliably on this new type of deepfake content.\nThis work addresses this gap by releasing a new large-scale audio-\nvisual dataset called AV-Deepfake1M specifically designed for the\ntask of temporal deepfake localization. To improve the realism and\nquality of generated content, the proposed data generation pipeline\nincorporates the ChatGPT1 large language model. The pipeline fur-\nther utilizes the latest open-source state-of-the-art methods for high-\nquality audio [8, 33] and video [62] generation. The scale and novel\nmodification strategies position the proposed dataset as the most\ncomprehensive audio-visual benchmark as illustrated in Figure 1,\nmaking it an important asset for building the next generation of\ndeepfake localization methods. The main contributions are,\n1https://chat.openai.com/\n\u2022 We propose AV-Deepfake1M, a large content-driven audio-\nvisual dataset for the task of temporal deepfake localization.\n\u2022 We propose an elaborate data generation pipeline employing\nnovel manipulation strategies and incorporating the state-of-\nthe-art in text, video and audio generation.\n\u2022 We perform comprehensive analysis and benchmark of the\nproposed dataset utilizing state-of-the-art deepfake detection\nand localization methods.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nThe performance of any deepfake detection method is highly de-\npendent on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the datasets\nused for development [18, 21, 25, 40, 44, 47, 49, 51, 52, 61, 63, 69,\n72, 75]. Over the past few years, many datasets (e.g., [22, 34, 41])\nhave been proposed to support the research on deepfake detection.\nA comprehensive list of the relevant publicly available datasets is\ngiven in Table 1. Most of the available datasets provide examples of\nface manipulations through either face swapping [16, 34, 77] or face\nreenactment [31, 35] techniques. In terms of the number of samples,\nearlier datasets are smaller due to the limited availability of face ma-\nnipulation techniques. With the rapid advancements in content gen-\neration technology, several large-scale datasets such as DFDC [16],\nDeeperForensics [28], KoDF [35], and DF-Platter [41] have been\nproposed. However, the task associated with these datasets is mainly\nrestricted to coarse-level deepfake detection. Until this point manip-\nulations are mainly applied only to the visual modality, and later,\naudio manipulations [39] and audio-visual manipulations [31] have\nbeen proposed to increase the complexity of the task.\nIn 2022, LAV-DF [6] was introduced to become the first content-\ndriven deepfake dataset for temporal localization. However, the qual-\nity and scale of LAV-DF are limited, and the state-of-the-art methods\ndesigned for temporal localization [4, 75] are already achieving\nvery strong performance. AV-Deepfake1M addresses these gaps by\nimproving the quality, diversity, and scale of the previous datasets de-\nsigned for temporal deepfake localization. Given that LAV-DF is the\nonly available public dataset that has been designed for the same task\nAV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset\nMM \u201924, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nAudio Generation\nTTS Options\nTranscript Manipulation\nVideo Generation\nReal Audio\nFake Speech Word \n\u0545Raw Output)\nFake Speech\nFake Video\nReal Video\nFake Audio Fake Frames\nFake Frames \nFake Audio\nFake Frames \nBg Noise\nFake Speech \nFull Sentence\nSpeech\nCollect\nFinetune\nStrip zero signals\nLoudness norm\nAll Speech of the Subject\nBg Noise\nReal Text\nText Manipulations\nGenerate\nReal Frames\nRef Pose\nWhisper\nWhisper\nTalkLip\nDenoiser\nYourTTS\nVITS\n\"... the great songbook ...  \nI'm not going to ... and unique ...\"\nYou are a helpful text modifier.

Overview of the proposed three-stage pipeline. Given a real video, the pre-processing\nconsists of audio extraction via FFmpeg followed by Whisper-based transcript generation. In the first stage, transcript manipulation, the original\ntranscript is modified through word-level insertions, deletions, and replacements. In the second stage, audio generation, based on the relevant\ntranscript manipulation, the audio is generated in both speaker-dependent and independent fashion. In the final stage, video generation, based\non the generated audio, the subject-dependant video is generated with smooth transitions in terms of lip-synchronization, pose, and other\nrelevant attributes.\nas the dataset proposed in this paper, next we do a direct comparison\nof the two datasets. In addition to the fact that AV-Deepfake1M is\nsignificantly larger than LAV-DF, in terms of the number of subjects,\nand amount of real and fake videos, the following differences further\nhighlight our contributions.\n\u2022 LAV-DF uses a rule-based system to find antonyms that max-\nimize the change in sentiment in the transcript manipulation\nstep. We argue that naively choosing the antonyms causes\ncontext inconsistencies and low diversity of the fake con-\ntent. AV-Deepfake1M addresses this issue with the use of a\nlarge language model, which results in diverse and context-\nconsistent fake content.\n\u2022 The output quality of the visual generator Wav2Lip [46] and\naudio generator SV2TTS [27] used for generating LAV-DF\nis not sufficient for state-of-the-art detection methods. AV-\nDeepfake1M utilizes the latest open-source state-of-the-art\nmethods for high-quality audio and video generation.\n\u2022 LAV-DF includes only replacement as a manipulation strat-\negy. AV-Deepfake1M includes two additional challenging\nmanipulation strategies, deletion and insertion.\n3\nAV-DEEPFAKE1M DATASET\nAV-Deepfake1M is a large-scale audio-visual deepfake dataset, in-\ncluding 1,886 hours of audio-visual data from 2,068 unique subjects\ncaptured in diverse background environments. This positions the\nproposed dataset as the most comprehensive audio-visual bench-\nmark as illustrated in Figure 1 and Table 1. The generated videos in\nAV-Deepfake1M preserve the background and identity present in the\nreal videos, while the content is carefully manipulated with content-\ndriven audio-visual data. Following previous deepfake dataset gen-\neration research [6, 31], the dataset includes three different combi-\nnations of modified modalities in the generated fake videos. Please\nnote that here we also introduce the concept of content-driven mod-\nifications for unimodal as well as multimodal aspects. We further\nelaborate on this in the supplementary material.\n\u2022 Fake Audio and Fake Visual. Both the real audio and visual\nframes are manipulated.\n\u2022 Fake Audio and Real Visual. Only the real audio correspond-\ning to replacements and deletions is manipulated. To further\nincrease data quality, the fake audio, and the corresponding\nlength-normalized real visual segments are synchronized. As\nfor the insertions, new visual segments are generated based\non the length of the fake audio and are lip-synced to the\nbackground noise (i.e., closed mouth).\n\u2022 Real Audio and Fake Visual. Only the real visual frames\ncorresponding to replacements and deletions are manipulated.\nTo further increase data quality, the length of the fake visual\nsegments is normalized to match the length of the real audio.\nAs for the insertions, background noise is inserted for the\ncorresponding fake visual segments.\n3.1\nData Generation Pipeline\nThe three-stage pipeline for generating content-driven deepfakes is il-\nlustrated in Figure 2. A subset of real videos from the Voxceleb2 [14]\ndataset is pre-processed to extract the audio using FFmpeg [58], fol-\nlowed by Whisper-based [48] real transcript generation.\nMM \u201924, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nCai et al.\n(a) Frequencies of the top 20 words\n(b) #Unique new words\nFrequency\n11,749\n424\n27.7x\nFigure 3: Comparison of transcript modifications in AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF.\n3.1.1\nTranscript Manipulation.\nManipulation Strategy. The first stage for generating content-driven\ndeepfakes is transcript manipulation. We utilize ChatGPT for altering\nthe real transcripts. Through LangChain [9] the output of ChatGPT\nis a structured JSON with four fields: 1) operation: This set\ncontains replace, delete, and insert, which has been applied on the\ninput; 2) old_word: The word in the input to replace or delete; 3)\nnew_word: The word in the input to insert or replace; 4) index:\nThe location of the operation in the input. The number of transcript\nmodifications depends on the video length and is determined by\nthe following equation \ud835\udc40= ceil(\ud835\udc61/10) where \ud835\udc40is the number of\nmodifications and \ud835\udc61(sec) is the length of the video. We followed [3]\nand built a few-shot prompt template for ChatGPT.\nPrompt 3.1: Transcripts manipulation\nSystem: You are a helpful text modifier. Your target is to modify the provided text\nto invert its meaning to the opposite direction.

Figure 3 (a) illustrates a comparison of the frequencies of\nthe top 20 words in AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF [6]. The results\nshow that few words in LAV-DF have dominant frequencies (>10%),\nwhereas this issue is drastically reduced in AV-Deepfake1M. Ow-\ning to the contribution of ChatGPT, we also observed a significant\nincrease in unique new words (>27.7\u00d7) in the modified transcripts\ncompared to LAV-DF, Figure 3 (b). This statistical comparison shows\nthat the proposed LLM-based transcript manipulation strategy gen-\nerates more diverse content compared to the rule-based strategy\nemployed in LAV-DF. We further elaborate on the advantages of\nusing an LLM in this step in the supplementary material.\n3.1.2\nAudio Generation.\nManipulation Strategy. The next stage is to generate high-quality\naudio with the same style as the speaker. The audio is first separated\ninto background noise and speech using Denoiser [17]. Zero-shot\nvoice cloning methods such as SV2TTS [27] utilized by previous\ndatasets [6, 31] have low signal-to-noise ratio resulting in low-quality\naudio manipulations that are easily localized by BA-TFD [4] and\nUMMAFormer [75]. To increase the quality of the generated audio,\nwe employ the identity-dependent text-to-speech method VITS [33]\nTable 2: Audio quality of AV-Deepfake1M.

Further diversity in the audio generation\nwas introduced by utilizing the identity-independent text-to-speech\nmethod YourTTS [8] for the rest of the subjects.\nAudio generation is slightly different for each of the manipu-\nlation strategies (i.e., replace, insert and delete). In the case of\nreplace and insert, we need to generate new audio correspond-\ning to new_word(s). Generally, there are two ways to generate\nthe new_word(s): 1) Generate audio for the final fake transcript\nand crop it to get the audio for the required new_word(s) and 2)\nGenerate audio only for the new_word(s). To bring further diver-\nsity and challenge, we use both strategies to generate audio for the\nnew_word(s). In the case of delete, only the background noise is\nretained. After the audio manipulation, we normalized the loudness\nof the fake audio segments to the original audio to add more realism.\nTo keep the consistency with the environmental noise, we add the\nbackground noise previously separated to the final audio output.\nAnalysis. We evaluated the quality of the audio generation following\nprevious works [7, 11] (note that for all datasets, we only evaluated\nthe samples where the audio modality is modified). The results are\nshown in Table 2. The first evaluation metric is speaker encoder co-\nsine similarity (SECS) [60]. It measures the similarity of the speakers\ngiven a pair of audio in the range [\u22121, 1]. We also calculated the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all fake audio and Fr\u00e9chet audio dis-\ntance (FAD) [32]. The results indicate that AV-Deepfake1M contains\nhigher quality audio compared to other datasets.\n3.1.3\nVideo Generation.\nManipulation Strategy. The final stage of the generation pipeline\nis visual content generation. After the audio is generated, the lip-\nsynced visual frames are generated based on the subjects\u2019 original\npose and the fake audio. We investigated several face reenactment\nstrategies including EAMM [26], AVFR-GAN [2], DiffTalk [54],\nAD-NeRF [20] and ATVGnet [10] and concluded that these methods\nare not well suited for zero-shot lip-synced generation of unseen\nspeakers. Thus, we use TalkLip [62] for visual content generation\nAV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset\nMM \u201924, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nTrain & Val \n1,657 (80.1%)\nTest \n411 (19.9%)\nTest \n343,240 (29.9%)\nYourTTS \n177,581 \nTrain \n746,180 (65.1%)\nVITS \n195,336 (52.4%)\nVITS \n171,600 (100%)\nVITS \n15,010 (52.1%)\nW (12.1%)\nF (40.3%)\nW (2.3%)\nF (45.3%)\nVal \n54,730 (4.8%)\nYourTTS \n13,791 (47.9%)\nW (12.1%)\nF (40.0%)\nW (2.4%)\nF (45.5%)\nVITS-Word \n(23.6%)\nVITS-Full\n(76.4%)\n(a) #Subjects\n(b) #Videos\n(c) #Videos in Train\n(d) #Videos in Val\n(e) #Videos in Test\nFigure 4: Data partitioning in AV-Deepfake1M.

This way\nwe avoid the weaknesses of the aforementioned face reenactment\nstrategies. The pre-trained TalkLip model is used to generate fake\nvisual frames that are lip-synchronized with the input audio and can\nbe used for insertion, replacement, and deletion.\nAnalysis. To evaluate the visual quality of AV-Deepfake1M, we\nused peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index\n(SSIM) [66] and Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) [24] metrics as\nshown in Table 3. Note that for a fair comparison, we pre-processed\nthe videos to a common format. The videos of FF++ [50] and\nDFDC [16] are \u2018in-the-wild\u2019, whereas FakeAVCeleb [31], LAV-\nDF [6] and AV-Deepfake1M are facial videos. Thus, we cropped\nthe facial region for FF++ and DFDC for visual quality assessment.\nSince FakeAVCeleb, LAV-DF and AV-Deepfake1M are multimodal,\nfor a fair comparison, we only used samples with the visual modal-\nity modified. The results indicate that AV-Deepfake1M is of higher\nvisual quality compared to existing datasets.\n3.2\nDataset Statistics\nWe split the dataset into train, validation, and test sets. We first\nrandomly select 1,657 subjects for the train set and 411 subjects for\nthe test set without overlap. The validation set is randomly selected\nfrom the train set. The test set contains only samples with VITS-\nbased identity-dependent audio. The variation in the number of\nsubjects and videos in the sets is presented in Table 4 and Figure 4.\nFigure 5 illustrates the direct comparison of AV-Deepfake1M and\nLAV-DF. The results indicate that AV-Deepfake1M is more diverse\nin terms of modifications, subjects, fake segment and video lengths,\nand a lower average proportion of fake segments, making the dataset\na vital asset for building better deepfake localization methods.\nMM \u201924, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nCai et al.\nTable 4: Number of subjects and videos in AV-Deepfake1M.\nSubset\n#Subjects\n#Real Videos\n#Fake Videos\n#Videos\nTrain\n1,657\n186,666\n559,514\n746,180\nValidation\n14,235\n43,105\n54,730\nTest\n411\n85,820\n257,420\n343,240\nOverall\n2,068\n286,721\n860,039\n1,146,760\nTable 5: User study results for AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF.\nUser Study\nAcc.\nAP@0.1\nAP@0.5\nAR@1\nLAV-DF\n84.03\n36.80\n14.17\n10.04\nAV-Deepfake1M\n68.64\n15.32\n01.92\n02.54\n3.3\nHuman Quality Assessment\nTo investigate if humans can detect the deepfakes in AV-Deepfake1M,\nwe also conducted a user study with 25 participants with prior experi-\nence in video manipulation in the computer vision domain (note that\nthe authors did not participate in the study)2. 200 random samples\nthat contain 0 or 1 modification were selected for the study, where\n100 from LAV-DF and 100 from AV-Deepfake1M. Each participant\nwas asked to classify 20 videos (5 real and 5 fake from LAV-DF\ndataset, 5 real and 5 fake from AV-Deepfake1M) as real or fake and\npropose the potential fake segment start and end point. The user\nstudy results presented in Table 5 indicate that the deepfake content\nin AV-Deepfake1M is very challenging to detect for humans, and\nAV-Deepfake1M is more difficult than LAV-DF.\n3.4\nComputational Cost\nWe spent around \u223c600 GPU hours for speech recognition with Whis-\nper [48], \u223c2100 GPU hours for training VITS [33] (each of the\n721 VITS models requires \u223c3hrs), and \u223c300 GPU hours for data\ngeneration. Overall, we needed \u223c3000 GPU hours to generate AV-\nDeepfake1M with NVIDIA RTX6000 GPUs.\n4\nBENCHMARKS AND METRICS\nThis section outlines the benchmark protocol for AV-Deepfake1M\nalong with the used evaluation metrics. The goal is to detect and lo-\ncalize content-driven audio, visual, and audio-visual manipulations.\n4.1\nData Partitioning\nThe dataset is organized in train, validation, and test sets, as de-\nscribed in Section 3.2. The original test set (all modifications) is\nreferred to as fullset in the rest of the text. For a fair comparison with\nvisual-only and audio-only methods, we also prepared subset V (by\nexcluding the videos with audio-only modifications from fullset) and\nsubset A (by excluding the videos with visual-only modifications\nfrom fullset).\n4.2\nImplementation Details\nFor benchmarking temporal deepfake localization, we consider the\nfollowing state-of-the-art methods: Pyannote [45] is a pre-trained\nspeaker diarization method. TriDet [55] and ActionFormer [73] are\nthe state-of-the-art in the temporal action localization domain. Since\n2All procedures in this study were conducted in accordance with Monash University\nHuman Research Ethics Committee approval 41545.\nthese two methods require pre-trained features, we extracted the\nstate-of-the-art features VideoMAEv2 [64] and InternVideo [65] for\nbenchmarking. BA-TFD [6], BA-TFD+ [4], and UMMAFormer [75]\nare the state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for audio-\nvisual temporal deepfake localization. We followed the original\nsettings for BA-TFD and BA-TFD+. For UMMAFormer [75], we\nimplemented it using the InternVideo [65] visual features and BYOL-\nA [43] audio features. For image-based classification methods, we\nconsider Meso4 [1], MesoInception4 [1], Xception [12], Face X-\nRay [36], LipForensics [21], EfficientViT [15], and SBI [56]. We\nfollowed the procedure used in previous works [4, 76] to aggregate\nthe frame-level predictions to segments for localization.\nFor benchmarking deepfake detection, we trained the image-based\nmodels Meso4 [1], MesoInception4 [1], Xception [12] and Effi-\ncientViT [15] with video frames along with the corresponding labels.\nFor the segment-based methods MDS [13] and MARLIN [5], we\nused a sliding window to sample segments from the video for training\nand inference. During the inference stage, the frame- and segment-\nlevel predictions are aggregated to video-level by max voting. The\naggregation strategy is discussed in Section 5. We also evaluated the\nzero-shot performance of several methods, including the LLM-based\nVideo-LLaMA [74], audio pre-trained CLAP [68], M2TR [63] and\nLipForensics [21] pre-trained on FF++ [50], Face X-Ray [36] and\nSBI [56] pretrained on blending images. For Video-LLaMA, we\nalso evaluated 5 model ensembles (the majority vote of 5 model\ninferences). To investigate the impact of the level of label access,\nwe designed 3 different label access levels for training: frame-level\nlabels, segment-level labels only, and video-level labels only.\n4.3\nEvaluation Metrics\nTemporal Deepfake Localization. We use average precision (AP)\nand average recall (AR) as prior works [6, 22].\nDeepfake Detection. We use standard evaluation protocol [16, 50] to\nreport video-level accuracy (Acc.) and area under the curve (AUC).\n5\nRESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nThis section reports the performance of the state-of-the-art deepfake\ndetection and localization methods described in Section 4.2 on AV-\nDeepfake1M. The reported performance is based on different subsets,\ndescribed in Section 4.1, and different levels of label access during\ntraining, described in Section 4.2.\n5.1\nAudio-Visual Temporal Deepfake Localization\nThe results of this benchmark are depicted in Table 6. All state-of-the-\nart methods achieve significantly lower performance compared to the\nperformance reported on previous datasets [6, 22]. This significant\ndrop indicates that existing temporal deepfake localization methods\nare falling behind with the rapid advancements in content generation.\nIn other words, we can claim that the highly realistic fake content\nin AV-Deepfake1M will open an avenue for further research on\ntemporal deepfake localization methods.\n5.2\nAudio-Visual Deepfake Detection\nSimilarly to temporal deepfake localization, the results of the clas-\nsical deepfake detection benchmark are summarized in Table 7.\nAV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset\nMM \u201924, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nTable 6: Temporal deepfake localization benchmark.

However, even\nwith the frame-level labels provided during training, the AUC of\nthe best-performing methods is less than 70, due to the multimodal\nmodifications present in AV-Deepfake1M.\nThe frame- and segment-based deepfake detection methods can\nonly produce frame- and segment-level predictions. Thus, a suitable\naggregation strategy is required to generate the video-level predic-\ntions. We investigated several popular aggregation strategies, such\nas max (e.g., [6]), average (e.g., [15, 23, 63]), and the average of the\nhighest 5 scores (e.g., [37]) for video-level predictions. The results\nof the experiment are presented in Table 9. The results show that\nmax is the optimal aggregation strategy on AV-Deepfake1M for the\nconsidered deepfake detection methods.\n5.3\nUnimodal Deepfake Detection and Localization\nWe also evaluated the performance on subset V and subset A, as\ndescribed in Section 4.1. As expected, all visual-only methods con-\nsistently perform better on subset V compared to fullset for both\ntemporal localization and detection. The same holds for subset A\nand audio-only methods.\n5.4\nBenchmark Comparison\nWe conducted additional experiments (Tables 8 and 10) to compare\nthe performance on temporal localization and classification on AV-\nDeepfake1M and LAV-DF [6].\nThere is a significant drop in BA-TFD [6] temporal localization\nperformance as compared to LAV-DF (Table 8). A similar pattern\nis also observed for BA-TFD+ [4] (AP@0.5 96.30 \u219244.42) and\nUMMAFormer [75] (AP@0.5 98.83 \u219251.64). For classification\n(Table 10), the performance of Xception [12], LipForensics [21],\nFace X-Ray [36], and SBI [56] also drops compared to LAV-DF.\nThese additional results further validate that AV-Deepfake1M is\nmore challenging than LAV-DF.\nWe conduct the experiments using Xception and BA-TFD pre-\ntrained on AV-Deepfake1M then finetune and evaluate on LAV-DF,\nshown in Table 11. We observe the performance improvements are\nsignificant for both temporal localization with BA-TFD and clas-\nsification with Xception, when compared with models trained on\nLAV-DF from scratch.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nThis paper presents AV-Deepfake1M, the largest audio-visual dataset\nfor temporal deepfake localization.

Owing to the diversified and realistic, content-\ndriven fake videos, AV-Deepfake1M will support the development\nof robust audio-visual deepfake detection and localization models.\nEthics Statement. We acknowledge that AV-Deepfake1M may raise\nethical concerns such as the potential misuse of facial videos of\ncelebrities, and even the data generation pipeline could have a poten-\ntial negative impact. Misuse could include the creation of deepfake\nvideos or other forms of exploitation. To avoid such issues, we have\ntaken several measures such as distributing the data with a proper\nend-user license agreement, where we will impose certain restric-\ntions on the usage of the data, such as the data generation technology\nand resulting content being restricted to research purposes only.\nAV-Deepfake1M: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset\nMM \u201924, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nREFERENCES\n[1] Darius Afchar, Vincent Nozick, Junichi Yamagishi, and Isao Echizen. 2018.\nMesoNet: a Compact Facial Video Forgery Detection Network.

Figure 6 illustrates word clouds for\nold_word(s) and new_word(s) for both datasets. A comparison\nbetween the new words generated by the rule-based strategy utilized\nin LAV-DF and our LLM-driven generation further demonstrates that\nthe latter results in more natural and diverse transcript manipulations.\nB\nHUMAN QUALITY ASSESSMENT\nHere we provide further details on the user study (see Section 3.3)\nthat aims to evaluate humans\u2019 performance in detecting the highly\nrealistic deepfake content in AV-Deepfake1M.\nB.1\nData\nThe data used in the user study are 200 videos randomly sampled\nfrom the test set of AV-Deepfake1M and LAV-DF [6], with the aim\nto maximize the number of unique identities. Please note that the\nuser study setup ensures each participant cannot see a duplicated\nidentity. The videos include 50 real videos from AV-Deepfake1M,\n50 fake videos from AV-Deepfake1M, 50 real videos from LAV-DF,\nand 50 fake videos from LAV-DF. For fair comparison with LAV-\nDF, the fake videos contain only one audio-visual replacement (see\nSection 3).\nB.2\nParticipants\nWe randomly group the participants into 10 groups where each group\nevaluates 10% of the videos (i.e., 20 videos including 5 real videos\nFigure 7: Screenshot of the user study interface. On the top is the\nvideo with audio, the middle is the textual description of the task,\nand the bottom is the participant\u2019s controls to 1) Select whether the\nvideo is real or fake and 2) If the participant selects fake, use a slider\nto specify the begin and end of the fake segment.\nfrom AV-Deepfake1M, 5 fake videos from AV-Deepfake1M, 5 real\nvideos from LAV-DF, and 5 fake videos from LAV-DF). We utilize\na random non-overlapping selection of videos for each participant,\nmeaning that each participant evaluates videos for 20 out of the\n200 videos. After watching each video, the participants first answer\nwhether the video is real or fake, and if they think the video is fake,\nthe participants can choose the start and end timestamps for the fake\nsegment. A screenshot of the developed user study interface based\non the React3 framework is shown in Figure 7.\nB.3\nEvaluation and Analysis\nAmong the 25 participants that took part in the user study, the bi-\nnary deepfake detection/classification accuracy is 64.84% for AV-\nDeepfake1M. This low performance indicates that the deepfake\ncontent in AV-Deepfake1M is very challenging for humans to de-\ntect. A similar pattern is observed for the temporal localization of\nfake segments. Similarly to Table 5, here we report and compare\naverage precision (AP) and average recall (AR) scores in Table 12\nand extend that comparison with the state-of-the-art methods using\nthe same subset of videos. The AP score for 0.5 IoU is 01.92. Thus,\nwe reduced the AP threshold to 0.1 IoU, improving the AP score to\n15.32. Figure 8 illustrates a similar qualitative comparison. The low\nhuman performance in each aspect indicates that to detect highly\nrealistic deepfake content, we need more sophisticated detection and\nlocalization methods.\n3https://react.dev/\nMM \u201924, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nCai et al.\nGT\nHuman 1\nHuman 2\nHuman 3\nEffecientViT\nBA-TFD\nBA-TFD+\nUMMAFormer\nGT\nHuman 1\nHuman 2\nHuman 3\nEffecientViT\nBA-TFD\nBA-TFD+\nUMMAFormer\nGT\nHuman 1\nHuman 2\nHuman 3\nEffecientViT\nBA-TFD\nBA-TFD+\nUMMAFormer\nGT\nHuman 1\nHuman 2\nHuman 3\nEffecientViT\nBA-TFD\nBA-TFD+\nUMMAFormer\nGT\nHuman 1\nHuman 2\nHuman 3\nEffecientViT\nBA-TFD\nBA-TFD+\nUMMAFormer\nGT\nHuman 1\nHuman 2\nHuman 3\nEffecientViT\nBA-TFD\nBA-TFD+\nUMMAFormer\nGT\nHuman 1\nHuman 2\nHuman 3\nEffecientViT\nBA-TFD\nBA-TFD+\nUMMAFormer\nGT\nHuman 1\nHuman 2\nHuman 3\nEffecientViT\nBA-TFD\nBA-TFD+\nUMMAFormer\nFigure 8: Examples of user study results and comparison with the state-in-the-art in temporal deepfake localization.

However, such a corpus for\nJapanese speech synthesis does not exist. In this paper, we\ndesigned a novel Japanese speech corpus, named the \u201cJSUT\ncorpus,\u201d that is aimed at achieving end-to-end speech synthe-\nsis. The corpus consists of 10 hours of reading-style speech\ndata and its transcription and covers all of the main pronun-\nciations of daily-use Japanese characters. In this paper, we\ndescribe how we designed and analyzed the corpus. The cor-\npus is freely available online.\nIndex Terms\u2014 speech corpus, Japanese, speech synthe-\nsis, end-to-end\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThanks to developments in deep learning techniques,\nstudies on speech have accelerated [1, 2, 3, 4]. In particu-\nlar, in speech-to-text and text-to-speech research, end-to-end\nconversion from speech to text or from text to speech is an\nactively targeted task. Some studies on speech synthesis re-\nported methods that do not use linguistic knowledge, e.g.,\nno use of intermediate representations such as phonemes, in\nEnglish, Spanish, and German [5, 6, 7]. However, it is known\nthat natural language processing for Japanese is a more dif-\n\ufb01cult task, e.g., semantic parsing and grapheme-to-phoneme\nconversion [8].\nWe expect that a Japanese speech corpus\nthat is freely available would accelerate related research such\nas on end-to-end speech synthesis. However, there are no\nexisting corpora, e.g., [9], for this purpose.\nIn this paper, we describe the results of constructing a\nfree, large-scale Japanese speech corpus, named the \u201cJSUT\n(Japanese speech corpus of Saruwatari Laboratory, the Uni-\nversity of Tokyo) corpus.\u201d The corpus is designed to have all\npronunciations of daily-use characters and individual read-\nings in Japanese, which are not measured by conventional\nintermediate representation, such as phonemes and prosody.\nAlso, it includes different-domain utterances, such as loan-\nwords, and travel-domain and precedent utterances.\nWe\nrecorded 10 hours of speech data read by a native Japanese\nspeaker and analyzed its linguistic and speech statistics. The\ncorpus, including Japanese text and speech data, is freely\navailable online [10].\n2. CORPUS DESIGN\n2.1. Structures\nTo accelerate end-to-end research, the main purpose of\nthe JSUT corpus is to cover all of the main pronunciations\nof daily-use Japanese characters, not to cover intermedi-\nate representations such as phonemes. The corpus includes\nthe following nine sub-corpora. Their name is formatted as\n[NAME][NUMBER]. [NUMBER] indicates the number of\nutterances of the sub-corpus.\n\u2022 basic5000 ... utterances to cover all of the main pro-\nnunciations of daily-use Japanese characters.\n\u2022 countersuf\ufb01x26: utterances including individual read-\nings of counter suf\ufb01xes.\n\u2022 loanword128: utterances including loanwords, e.g.,\nverbs or nouns.\n\u2022 utparaphrase512:\nutterances for which a word or\nphrase of a piece of text is replaced with its paraphrase.\n\u2022 voiceactress100:\npara-speech for a free corpus of\nJapanese voice actresses [11].\n\u2022 onomatopee300: utterances including famous Japanese\nonomatopee (onomatopoeia).\n\u2022 repeat500: repeatedly spoken utterances.\n\u2022 travel1000: travel-domain utterances.\n\u2022 precedent130: precedent-domain utterances.\n2.2. Components\nWe describe how we designed the nine sub-corpora below.\n2.2.1. basic5000\nThis is the main sub-corpus of the JSUT corpus.\nIn\nJapanese, 2136 kanji characters (kanji are the logographic\ncharacters used in the modern Japanese writing system) are\nof\ufb01cially de\ufb01ned as daily-use characters [12], and each char-\nacter has individual pronunciations consisting of its individual\nkunyomi (Chinese readings) and onyomi (Japanese readings).\nFor example, we pronounce \u201c\u4e00\u201d (one in English) as \u201cichi,\u201d\n\u201citsu,\u201d \u201chito,\u201d and \u201chito (tsu).\u201d we collected 5000 sentences\nfrom Wikipedia [13] and the TANAKA corpus [14] so that\nall pronunciations of the daily-use kanji characters could be\ncovered. Some of the pronunciations cannot be found in these\ncorpora, therefore, we manually made additional sentences to\ncover the remaining readings.\n2.2.2. countersuf\ufb01x26\nIn Japanese, numerals cannot quantify nouns by them-\nselves, and the pronunciation of the numerals changes de-\npending on the suf\ufb01x. For example, \u201c\u4e8c\u201d (\u201ctwo\u201d in English)\nis pronounced \u201cni\u201d with \u201c\u500b\u201d (ko) as the suf\ufb01x and \u201cfuta\u201d\nwith \u201c\u3064\u201d (tsu) . We crowdsourced 26 sentences including\nsuch counter suf\ufb01xes.\n2.2.3. loanword128\nJapanese sentences spoken daily have many loanwords,\ne.g., verbs and nouns, for example, \u201c\u30b0\u30b0\u308b(guguru)\u201d is\na verb meaning to Google, and \u201c\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc(dyizunii)\u201d\nmeans Disney. The pronunciations and accents of loanwords\nare a curious task in spoken language processing [15]. We\ncrowdsourced such words and sentences. Also, we collected\nsentences from Wikipedia that included pronunciations not\nincluded in the modern Japanese system, for example, sen-\ntences that had a Japanese-accented foreign proper name.\n2.2.4. utparaphrase512\nParaphrasing, e.g., lexical simpli\ufb01cation, is a technique\nthat substitutes a word or phrase into another sentence [16,\n17]. It can support the reading comprehension of a wide range\nof readers in speech communication. The SNOW E4 corpus\n[17, 18] includes sentences and a list of its paraphrased words.\nWe chose one paraphrased word per sentence, and constructed\n256 sentences and paraphrased sentences. The total number\nof sentences was 512.\n2.2.5. voiceactress100\nThe Voice Actress Corpus [11] is a free speech corpus of\nprofessional Japanese voice actresses and includes not only\nneutral but also emotional voices. Collecting para-speech for\nthis speech corpus is very helpful to build attractive and emo-\ntional speech synthesis systems. We used sentences from this\ncorpus and manually modi\ufb01ed the pause positions.\n2.2.6. Onomatopee300\nOnomatopee (onomatopoeia) has an important role in\nconnecting speech and non-speech sounds in nature, and\nJapanese is rich in onomatopoeia words. We crowdsourced\n300 sentences having individual onomatopoeia words.\n2.2.7. repeat500\nHuman speech production is not deterministic, i.e., speech\nwaveforms always differ even if we try to reproduce the same\nlinguistic and para-linguistic information. Takamichi et al.\n[3] proposed moment matching network-based speech syn-\nthesis that synthesizes speech with natural randomness within\nthe same contexts. To quantify randomness, we recorded ut-\nterances spoken repeatedly by a single speaker. The speaker\nmade utterances 5 times for each of the 100 sentences of the\nVoice Actress Corpus.\n2.2.8. travel1000 and precedent138\nWe further constructed sentences whose domain differed\nfrom the above corpora. 1000 travel-domain sentences were\ncollected from English-Japanese Translation Alignment Data\n[19]. Also, 138 copyright-free precedent sentences were col-\nlected from [20]. The words and phrases of the precedent sen-\ntences were signi\ufb01cantly different from the above corpora, but\nsome sentences are too dif\ufb01cult to read. Therefore, we man-\nually removed and modi\ufb01ed these sentences to make reading\neasier.\n3. RESULTS OF DATA COLLECTION\n3.1. Corpus specs\nWe hired a female native Japanese speaker and recorded\nher voice in our anechoic room. She was not a professional\nspeaker but had experience working with her voice.\nThe\nrecordings were made in February, March, September, and\nOctober of 2017 for a few hours each day. The speaker made\nthe recordings herself with our recording system. The speech\ndata was sampled at 48 kHz. We used Lancers [21] to collect\nseveral kinds of Japanese sentences. The total duration was\n10 hours including small amounts of the non-speech region.\nThe 16 bit/sample RIFF WAV format was used. Sentences\n(transcriptions) were encoded in UTF-8.\nThe distributed corpora included UTF-8-encoded sen-\ntences, 48-kHz speech, and recording information. Because\nthe recording period was comparably long and the objective\nscores among the recording days varied as shown below, the\nrecording information shows what day the speech data was\nrecorded.\nThe power of the speech data was normalized,\nbut basically we made no additional modi\ufb01cations. Commas\nwere added between breath groups.\nThe positions of the\ncommas were manually annotated.\n3.2. Analysis\nWe analyzed the linguistic and speech information of\nthe constructed corpus.\nNote that not all of the data was\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nNumber of moras in one utterance\n0.000\n0.005\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\nFrequency\nFig. 1.\nHistogram of number of moras (sub-syllables) in\none utterance.

First,\nwe counted the number of moras (sub-syllables) and words\nwithin one utterance by using MeCab [22] and NEologd\n[23, 24].\nThe utterance length is the important factor in\nspeech synthesis using the sequence-to-sequencemechanisms\n[25, 26]. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show histograms of the moras\nand words, respectively. As we can see, the corpus included\na variety of lengths, from short utterances (a few words and\nmoras) to long utterances (70 words and 140 moras).\nNext, we analyzed the changes in speech statistics per\nrecording day.\nSpeech data recorded during long periods\ncauses objective and subjective differences among recording\ndays [27].\nThe Mean of log F0 was calculated for each\nrecording day.\nF0 was extracted by using the WORLD\nanalysis-synthesis system [28].\nFig.\n3 shows the result.\nThere was no special tendency in the \ufb01rst half of the record-\nings, but we can see that the log F0 increased for the days of\nthe second half.\n1st\n5th\n9th\n15th\n16th\n42th\n43th\n53th\n54th\n160th\n161st\n162th\n163th\n164th\n165th\n166th\n173th\n174th\nRecording day\n5.32\n5.34\n5.36\n5.38\n5.40\n5.42\nMean of log F0\nFig. 3.

However, most existing talking face video\ngeneration methods only consider facial animation with \ufb01xed head pose. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a deep\nneural network model that takes an audio signal A of a source person and a very short video V of a target person as input, and outputs\na synthesized high-quality talking face video with personalized head pose (making use of the visual information in V), expression and\nlip synchronization (by considering both A and V). The most challenging issue in our work is that natural poses often cause in-plane\nand out-of-plane head rotations, which makes synthesized talking face video far from realistic. To address this challenge, we\nreconstruct 3D face animation and re-render it into synthesized frames. To \ufb01ne tune these frames into realistic ones with smooth\nbackground transition, we propose a novel memory-augmented GAN module. By \ufb01rst training a general mapping based on a publicly\navailable dataset and \ufb01ne-tuning the mapping using the input short video of target person, we develop an effective strategy that only\nrequires a small number of frames (about 300 frames) to learn personalized talking behavior including head pose. Extensive\nexperiments and two user studies show that our method can generate high-quality (i.e., personalized head movements, expressions\nand good lip synchronization) talking face videos, which are naturally looking with more distinguishing head movement effects than the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\nIndex Terms\u2014Face generation, Video synthesis, Speech-driven animation, Generative models.\n!\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nVisual and auditory modalities are two important sensory\nchannels in human-to-human or human-to-machine inter-\naction. The information in these two modalities are strongly\ncorrelated [1]. Recently, cross-modality learning and mod-\neling have attracted more and more attention in interdis-\nciplinary research, including computer vision, computer\ngraphics and multimedia (e.g., [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]).\nIn this paper, we focus on talking face video generation\nthat transfers a segment of audio signal of a source person\ninto the visual information of a target person. This kind of\naudio-driven vision models have a wide range of appli-\ncations, such as bandwidth-limited video transformation,\nvirtual anchors and role-playing game/move generation,\netc. Recently, many works have been proposed for this\npurpose (e.g., [2], [4], [8], [9]). However, most of them only\nconsider facial animation with \ufb01xed head pose.\nIn real-world scenarios, natural head movement plays an\nimportant role in high-quality communication [10] and hu-\nman perception is very sensitive to subtle head movement\nin real videos. In fact, human can easily feel uncomfortable\nin communication by talking with \ufb01xed head pose. In this\npaper, we propose a deep neural network model to gen-\n\u2022\nR. Yi, Z. Ye, Y.-J.

Bao is with the college of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang\nUniversity, Hangzhou, China.\nerate an audio-driven high-quality talking face video with\npersonalized head pose.\nInferring head pose from speech (abbreviated as pose-\nfrom-speech) is not a new idea (e.g., [11], [12]). Although\nsome measurable correlations have been observed between\nspeech and head pose [6], [13], predicting head motion from\nspeech is still a challenging problem. A practical method\nwas suggested in [12] that \ufb01rst infers facial activity from\nspeech and then models head pose from facial features.\nIn our work, by observing that simultaneously learning\ntwo related tasks in deep network may help improve the\nperformance of both tasks, we simultaneously infers facial\nexpressions and head pose from speech.\nSince natural head poses often cause in-plane and out-\nof-plane head rotations, it is very challenging to synthesize\na realistic talking face video with high-quality facial anima-\ntion and smooth background transition. To circumvent the\ndif\ufb01cult pose-from-speech problem and focus on addressing\nthe realistic video synthesis challenge, we design the input\nof our system to include a segment of audio signal of a\nsource person and a short (only a few seconds) talking face\nvideo of a target person. Note that with the popularization\nof smartphone, the cost of capturing a very short video (e.g.,\n10 seconds) is almost the same as taking a photo (e.g., sel\ufb01e).\nTherefore we use both facial and audio information in the\ninput short video to learn the personalized talking behavior\nof the target person (e.g., lip and head movements), which\ngreatly simpli\ufb01es our system.\nTo output a high-quality synthesized video of the target\nperson with personalized head pose when speaking the\ninput audio signal of source person, our system reconstructs\n3D face animation and re-renders it into video frames. Given\narXiv:2002.10137v2  [cs.CV]  5 Mar 2020\n2\na light-weight rendering engine with limited information,\nthese rendered frames are often far from realistic. We then\npropose a novel memory-augmented GAN module that can\nre\ufb01ne the rough rendered frames into realistic frames with\nsmooth transition, according to the identity feature of the\ntarget person. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed\nmethod is the \ufb01rst system that can transfer the audio signal\nof an arbitrary source person into the face talking video\nof an arbitrary target person with personalized head pose.\nAs a comparison, the previous work [7] can only generate\na high-quality talking face video with personalized head\npose for a speci\ufb01ed person (i.e., Obama) \u2014 since it requires\na large number of training data related to this speci\ufb01ed\nperson \u2014 and thus, it cannot generalize to arbitrary subjects.\nFurthermore, when the input short talking face video is not\navailable, our method can also use a face image as input and\nachieves comparable lip synchronization and video quality\nwith previous methods [2], [4], [9]. Our code is publicly\navailable1.\nThe contributions of this paper are mainly three-fold:\n\u2022\nWe propose a novel deep neural network model that\ncan transfer an audio signal of arbitrary source per-\nson into a high-quality talking face video of arbitrary\ntarget person, with personalized head pose and lip\nsynchronization.\n\u2022\nDifferent from the network [14] that \ufb01ne tunes\nthe rendering of a speci\ufb01ed parametric face model\ninto photo-realistic video frames, our memory-\naugmented\nGAN\nmodule\ncan\ngenerate\nphoto-\nrealistic video frames for various face identities (i.e.,\ncorresponding to different target person).\n\u2022\nBy \ufb01rst training a general mapping based on a pub-\nlicly available dataset [3] and \ufb01ne-tuning the map-\nping using the input short video of the target person,\nwe develop an effective strategy that only requires a\nsmall number of frames (about 300 frames) to learn\npersonalized talking behavior including head pose.\n2\nRELATED WORK\n2.1\nTalking face generation\nExisting talking face video generation methods can be\nbroadly categorised into two classes according to the driven\nsignal. One driven signal is video frames [14], [15], [16],\n[17], [18], [19], [20] and the other is audio [2], [4], [7], [8],\n[9], [18], [21], [22], [23]. Video-driven talking face video\ngeneration (a.k.a face reenactment) transferred expression\nand sometimes head pose from a driving frame to a face\nimage of target actor. Traditional optimization methods\ntransferred expression using 3DMM parameters [15], [24] or\nimage warping [16]. Learning-based methods [14], [19] were\ntrained by videos of target actor or general audio-visual data\nusing GAN model conditioned on image or additional land-\nmarks. Video-frame-driven methods only use one modality,\ni.e., visual information.\nAudio-driven methods make use of both visual and\nauditory modalities, which can be further classi\ufb01ed into\ntwo sub-classes: talking face video generation for speci\ufb01c\n1. https://github.com/yiranran/Audio-driven-TalkingFace-HeadPose\nface [7], [21] and for arbitrary target face [2], [4], [8], [9].\nThe latter methods usually take a clip of audio and one\narbitrary face image as input. Chung et al. [4] learned a\njoint embedding of the face and audio signal, and used an\nencoder-decoder CNN model to generate talking face video.\nZhou et al. [9] proposed a method in which both audio and\nvideo can serve as input by learning joint audio-visual rep-\nresentation. Chen et al. [2] \ufb01rst transferred the audio to facial\nlandmarks and then generated video frames conditioned\non the landmarks. Song et al. [8] proposed a conditional\nrecurrent adversarial network that integrated audio and\nimage features in recurrent units. However, in talking face\nvideos generated by these 2D methods, the head pose is\nalmost \ufb01xed during talking. This drawback is caused by the\ndefect inherent in 2D-based methods, since it is dif\ufb01cult to\nonly use 2D information alone for naturally modeling the\nchange of pose. Although Song et al. [8] mentioned that their\nmethod can be extended to personalized pose for a special\ncase, full details on this extension were not yet presented.\nIn comparison, we introduce 3D geometry information into\nthe proposed system to simultaneously model personalized\nhead pose, expression and lip synchronization.\n2.2\n3D face reconstruction\n3D face reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D shape and\nappearance of human face from 2D images. A large number\nof methods have been proposed in this area and the reader\nis referred to the survey [25] and reference therein. Most\nof these methods were based on 3D Morphable Model\n(3DMM) [26], which learned a PCA basis from scanned 3D\nface data set to represent general face shapes. Traditional\nmethods \ufb01t 3DMM by an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\nwhich optimized 3DMM parameters by minimizing differ-\nence between rendered reconstruction and the given im-\nage [26], [27], [28].\nLearning-based methods [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34],\n[35], [36], [37], [38], [39] used CNN to learn a mapping from\nface images to 3DMM parameters. To deal with the lack\nof suf\ufb01cient training data, some methods used synthetic\ndata [29], [30], [33], [38] while others use unsupervised\nor weakly-supervised learning [34], [35], [36], [39]. In this\npaper, we adopt the method [39] for 3D face reconstruction.\n2.3\nGANs and memory networks.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [40] have been\nsuccessfully applied to many computer vision problems.\nThe Pix2Pix proposed by Isola et al. [41] has shown great\npower in image-to-image translation between two different\ndomains. Later it was extended to video-to-video synthe-\nsis [42], [43]. It has also been applied to the \ufb01eld of facial\nanimation and texture synthesis. Kim et al. [14] use a GAN\nto transform rendered face image to realistic video frame.\nAlthough this method can achieve good results, it was only\nsuitable for a speci\ufb01c target person, and it had to be trained\nby thousands of samples related to this speci\ufb01c person.\nOlszewski et al.

So we can obtain the\n3D facial animation with personalized head pose.

Then we \ufb01ne tune these synthesized frames into realistic frames using a novel memory-augmented GAN\nmodule.\nimage captioning [48], and image colorization [49]. Since\nthis scheme can remember selected critical information, it is\neffective for one-shot or few-shot learning. In this paper, we\nuse a GAN augmented with memory networks to \ufb01ne tune\nrendered frames into realistic frames for arbitrary person.\n3\nOUR METHOD\nIn this paper, we tackle the problem of generating high-\nquality talking face video, when given an audio speech\nof a source person and a short video (about 10 seconds)\nof a target person. In addition to learn the transformation\nfrom the audio speech to lip motion and face expression,\nour talking face generation also considers the personalized\ntalking behavior (i.e., head pose) of the target person.\nTo achieve this goal, our idea is to use 3D facial animation\nwith personalized head pose as the kernel to bridge the gap be-\ntween audio-visual-driven head pose learning and realistic\ntalking face video generation. The \ufb02owchart of our method\nis illustrated in Figure 1, which can be interpreted in the\nfollowing two stages.\nStage 1: from audio-visual information to 3D facial animation.\nWe use the LRW video dataset [3] to train a general mapping\nfrom the audio speech to the facial expression and common\nhead pose. Then, given an audio signal and a short video,\nwe \ufb01rst reconstruct the 3D face (Section 3.1) and \ufb01ne tune\nthe general mapping to learn personalized talking behavior\nfrom the input video (Section 3.2). To this end, we obtain the\n3D facial animation with personalized head pose.\nStage 2: from 3D facial animation to realistic talking face\nvideo generation. We render the 3D facial animation into\nvideo frames using the texture and lighting information\nobtained from input video. With these limited information,\nthe graphic engine can only provide a rough rendering effect\nthat is usually not realistic enough for a high-quality video.\nTo re\ufb01ne these synthesized frames into realistic ones, we\npropose a novel memory-augmented GAN module (Section\n3.4) that was also trained by the LRW video dataset. This\nGAN module can deal with various identities and generate\nhigh-quality frames containing realistic talking faces that\nmatches the face identity extracted from input video.\nNote that both mapping in the above two stages involves\ntwo steps: one step is the general mapping learned from\nthe LRW video dataset and the second is a light-weight\n\ufb01ne-tuning step that learns/retrieves personalized talking\nor rendering information from the input video.\n3.1\n3D face reconstruction\nWe adopt a state-of-the-art deep learning based method [39]\nfor 3D face reconstruction. It uses a CNN to \ufb01t a parametric\nmodel of 3D face geometry, texture and illumination to an\ninput face photo I. This method reconstructs the 3DMM\ncoef\ufb01cients \u03c7(I) = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b3, p} \u2208R257, where \u03b1 \u2208R80 is\nthe coef\ufb01cient vector for face identity, \u03b2 \u2208R64 is for expres-\nsion, \u03b4 \u2208R80 is for texture, \u03b3 \u2208R27 is the coef\ufb01cient vector\nfor illumination, and p \u2208R6 is the pose vector including\nrotation and translation. Then the face shape S and face\ntexture T can be represented as S = \u00afS + Bid\u03b1 + Bexp\u03b2,\nT = \u00afT + Btex\u03b4, where \u00afS and \u00afT are average shape and tex-\nture, Bid, Bexp and Btex are PCA basis for shape, expression\nand texture separately. Basel Face Model [50] is used for Bid\nand Btex, and FaceWareHouse [51] is used for Bexp.\nThe illumination is computed using the Lambertian\nsurface assumption and approximated with spherical har-\nmonics (SH) basis functions [52]. The irradiance of vertex\nvi with normal vector ni and texture ti is C(ni, ti, \u03b3) =\nti\nPB2\nb=1 \u03b3b\u03a6b(ni), where \u03a6b : R3 \u2192R are SH basis func-\ntions, \u03b3b are SH coef\ufb01cients and B = 3 is the number of\nSH bands. The pose is represented by rotation angles and\ntranslation. A perspective camera model is used to project\nthe 3D face model onto the image plane.\n3.2\nMapping from audio to expression and pose\nIt is well recognized that the audio signal has strong cor-\nrelation with lip and lower-half face movements. However,\n4\ntalking faces with only lower-half face movements are stiff\nand far from natural. In other words, upper-half face (in-\ncluding eyes and brows) movements and head pose are\nalso essential for a natural talking face. We use both the\naudio information and the 3D face geometry information\nextracted from input video to establish a mapping from the\ninput audio to the facial expression and head pose. Note\nthat although a person may have different head poses when\nspeaking the same word, the speaking style in a short period\nis often consistent and we provide a correlation analysis\nbetween audio and pose in Appendix A.\nWe\nextract\nthe\nMel-frequency\ncepstral\ncoef\ufb01cients\n(MFCC) feature of the input audio, and model the facial\nexpression and head pose using 3DMM coef\ufb01cients. To es-\ntablish the mapping inbetween, we design a LSTM network\nas follows. Given the MFCC features of an audio sequence\ns = {s(1), . . . , s(T )}, a ground-truth expression coef\ufb01cient\nsequence \u03b2 = {\u03b2(1), . . . , \u03b2(T )}, and a ground-truth pose\nvector sequence p = {p(1), . . . , p(T )}, we generate pre-\ndicted expression coef\ufb01cient sequence e\u03b2 = {e\u03b2(1), . . . , e\u03b2(T )}\nand pose vector sequence ep = {ep(1), . . . , ep(T )}. Denoting\nthe LSTM network as R, our audio-to-expression-and-head\npose mapping can be formulated as\n[e\u03b2(t), ep(t), h(t), c(t)] = R(E(s(t)), h(t\u22121), c(t\u22121)),\n(1)\nwhere E is an additional audio encoder that is applied to\nthe MFCC feature of audio sequences s(t), and h(t), c(t)\nare hidden state and cell state of LSTM unit at time t\nrespectively.\nWe use a loss function containing four loss terms to\noptimize the network: a mean squared error (MSE) loss for\nexpression coef\ufb01cients, a MSE loss for pose coef\ufb01cients, an\ninter-frame continuity loss for pose, and an inter-frame con-\ntinuity loss for expression. Denote the shorthand notation\nof Eq. (1) as e\u03b2 = \u03c61(s), ep = \u03c62(s), the loss function is\nformulated as:\nL(R, E) = Es,\u03b2[(\u03b2 \u2212\u03c61(s))2] + \u03bb1Es,p[(p \u2212\u03c62(s))2]\n+ \u03bb2Es[\nT \u22121\nX\nt=0\n(\u03c62(s)(t+1) \u2212\u03c62(s)(t))2]\n+ \u03bb3Es[\nT \u22121\nX\nt=0\n(\u03c61(s)(t+1) \u2212\u03c61(s)(t))2],\n(2)\nwhere inter-frame continuity loss is computed by the\nsquared L2 norm of the gradient of the pose / expression.\n3.3\nRendering and background matching\n3.3.1\nRendering\nBy reconstructing the 3D face of the target person (Sec-\ntion 3.1) and generating the expression and pose sequences\n(Section 3.2), we collect a mixed sequence of 3DMM co-\nef\ufb01cients synchronized with audio speech, in which the\nidentity, texture and illumination coef\ufb01cients are from the\ntarget person, and expression and pose coef\ufb01cients are from\nthe audio. Given this mixed sequence of 3DMM coef\ufb01cients,\nwe can render a face image sequence using the rendering\nengine in [36].\nIf we compute the albedos from reconstructed 3DMM\ncoef\ufb01cients, these albedos are of low-frequency and too\nsmooth, resulting in the rendered face images that do not\nappear visually similar to the input face images. An alterna-\ntive is to compute a detailed albedo from input face images.\nI.e., we \ufb01rst project the reconstructed 3D shape (a face mesh)\nonto the image plane, and then we assign the pixel color\nto each mesh vertex. In this way, the albedo is computed\nby dividing illumination. Finally, the albedo from the frame\nwith the most neutral expression and the smallest rotation\nangles is set as the albedo of the video.\nWe use the above mentioned both schemes in our\nmethod. In the general mapping, we use the detailed albedo\nfor rendering, because videos in the LRW dataset are very\nshort (about 1 second). In the personalized mapping (i.e.,\ntuning by input short video), we use the low-frequency\nalbedo to tolerate the change of head pose, and the input\nvideo (about 10 seconds) can provide more training data\nof the target person to \ufb01ne tune the synthesized frames\n(rendered with a low-frequency albedo) into realistic ones.\n3.3.2\nBackground matching\nSo far the rendered frames only have the facial part, without\nthe hair and background regions that are also essential for\na realistic talking face video. An intuitive solution is to\nmatch a background from the input video by matching\nthe head pose. However, for a short video of about 10\nseconds, we only have less than 300 frames to select a\nsuitable background, which is very few and can be regarded\nas very sparse points in the possible high-dimensional pose\nspace. Our experiment also shows that this intuitive solution\ncannot produce good video frames.\nIn our method, we propose to extract some keyframes\nfrom the synthesized pose sequence, where the keyframes\ncorrespond to critical head movements in the synthesized\npose sequence. We choose the key frames to be the frames\nwith largest head orientation in one axis in a short period of\ntime, e.g., the frame with leftmost or rightmost head pose.\nThen we only match backgrounds for these keyframes. We\ncall these matched backgrounds as key backgrounds. For\nthose frames between two neighboring keyframes, we use\nlinear interpolation to determine their backgrounds. The\npose in each frame is also modi\ufb01ed to \ufb01t the background. Fi-\nnally the whole rendered frames are assembled by including\nthe matched backgrounds.\nIf only a signal face image I is input instead of a short\nvideo, we obtain the matched background by rotating I to\nthe predicted pose using the face pro\ufb01ling method in [30].\n3.4\nMemory-augmented GAN for re\ufb01ning frames\nThe synthesized frames rendered by the light-weight\ngraphic engine [36] are usually far from realistic. To re\ufb01ne\nthese frames into realistic ones, we propose a memory-\naugmented GAN. The differences between our method\nand the previous GAN-based face reenactment (FR) meth-\nods [14] are:\n\u2022\nFR only re\ufb01nes the frames for a single, speci\ufb01ed face\nidentity, while our method can deal with various\nface identities. I.e., given different identity features of\ntarget faces, our method can output different frame\nre\ufb01nement effects with the same GAN model.\n5\nMemory Network\nGenerator\nSpatial\nfeatures\nIdentity\nfeatures\nfS[i]\nfI[i]\nfS[j]\nfI[j]\nfS[k]\nfI[k]\nDiscriminator\nDuring training,\nupdate memory\nResnet\nq\nDuring test, retrieve the\nbest-match identity feature\nA window of\nrendered\nframes\nfI\nIdentity\nfeature\n\u2026\n\u2026\nColor mask\nAttention mask\nMLP\n\u2026\n\u2026\nAdaIN\nparams\nRefined frame\nTop: Rendered frames\nBottom: refined frame\nFake\nReal\nFC\nTop: Rendered frames\nBottom: real frame\nFig. 2. Our memory-augmented GAN for re\ufb01ning rendered frames into realistic frames. The generator takes a window of rendering frames and an\nidentity feature as input, and generate a re\ufb01ned frame based on attention mechanism. Discriminator judges whether a frame is real or not. The\nmemory network is introduced to remember representative identities during training and retrieve the best-match identity feature during test. During\nthe training, the memory network is updated by paired spatial features and ground-truth identity features. During the test, the memory network\nretrieves the best-match identity feature using the spatial feature as query.\n\u2022\nFR uses thousands of frames to train a network for\na single, speci\ufb01ed face identity, while we only use a\nfew frames for each identity in the general mapping\nlearning. Based on the general mapping, we \ufb01ne tune\nthe network using a small number of frames for the\ntarget face (from the input short video).\nWe model the frame re\ufb01nement process as a function\n\u03a6 that maps from the rendered frame (i.e., synthesized\nframe rendered by the graphic engine) domain R to the\nreal frame domain T using paired training data {(ri, gi)},\nri \u2208R and gi \u2208T . To handle multiple-identity re\ufb01nement,\nwe build a GAN network that consists of a conditional\ngenerator G, a conditional discriminator D and an addi-\ntional memory network M (Figure 2). The memory network\nstores paired features, i.e., (spatial feature, identity feature),\nwhich are updated during the training process. Its role is to\nremember representative identities including rare instances\nin the training set, and retrieve the best-match identity\nfeature during the test. The conditional generator takes a\nwindow of rendered frames (i.e., a subset of 3 adjacent\nframes rt\u22122, rt\u22121, rt) and an identity feature as input, and\nsynthesize a re\ufb01ned frame ot using the U-Net [53] with\nAdaIN [54]. The conditional discriminator takes a window\nof rendered frames and either a re\ufb01ned frame or a real\nframe as input, and decides whether the frame is real or\nsynthesized.\nAttention-based generator G. We use an attention-based\ngenerator to re\ufb01ne rendering frames. Given a window of\nrendered frames (rt\u22122, rt\u22121, rt) and an identity feature ft\n(extracted from ArcFace [55]), the generator synthesizes\nboth a color mask Ct and an attention mask At, and outputs\na re\ufb01ned frame ot that is the weighted average of the\nrendered frame and color mask:\not = At \u00b7 rt + (1 \u2212At) \u00b7 Ct\n(3)\nThe attention mask speci\ufb01es how much each pixel in the\ngenerated color mask contributes to the \ufb01nal re\ufb01nement.\nOur generator architecture is based on a U-Net structure2\nand has two modi\ufb01cations. (1) To generate two outputs (i.e.,\ncolor and attention masks), we modify the last convolution\nblock to two parallel convolution blocks, in which each\none generates one mask. (2) To take both a window of\nrendered frames and an identity feature as input, we adopt\nAdaIN [54] to incorporate identity features into our net-\nwork, where AdaIN parameters are generated from input\nidentity features. Experimental results show that our net-\nwork can generate delicate target-person-dependent texture\nfor various identities.\nMemory network M. We use a memory network to\nremember representative identities including rare instances\nin the training set, so that during the test we can retrieve\nsimilar identity feature from it. We adapt the network in [49]\nin our system by modifying it to output continuous frames.\nIn particular, our memory network stores paired spatial\nfeatures and identity features. The spatial feature is extracted\nby (1) feeding the input rendered frame into ResNet18 [56]\npre-trained on ImageNet [57], (2) extracting the \u2018pool5\u2019\nfeature, and (3) passing the \u2018pool5\u2019 feature to a learn-able\nfully connected layer and normalization. The paired identity\n2. The attention mechanism has also been used in the work [17].\nHowever, the difference in our network is that we also input an\nadditional identity feature into the network, which enables generating\ndifferent re\ufb01ning effects for different identities.\n6\nReal video\nGenerated\nReal video\nGenerated\nFig. 3. Comparison of real videos with natural head pose and our generated talking face videos with personalized behavior. Our method can achieve\nboth good lip synchronization and personalized head pose.\nfeature is extracted by feeding the corresponding ground-\ntruth frame into ArcFace [55].\nDuring the training, we update the memory network\nusing paired features extracted from the training set. This\nupdating includes (1) a threshold triplet loss3 [49] to make\nspatial features of similar identities closer and spatial fea-\ntures of different identities farther, and (2) a memory item\nupdating process, where either an existing feature pair is\nupdated or an old pair is replaced4 by a new pair. During the\ntest, we retrieve the identity feature by using the spatial fea-\nture as query, \ufb01nding its nearest spatial feature in memory\nand returning the corresponding identity feature. Noting\nthat directly feeding this feature into the generator may\nlead to jittering effects, we smooth the retrieved features\nin multiple adjacent frames by interpolation and use the\nsmoothed features as inputs for the generator.\nDiscriminator D. The conditional discriminator takes a\nwindow of rendered frames and a checking frame (either a\nre\ufb01ned frame or a real frame) as input, and discriminates\nwhether the checking frame is real or not. We adopt Patch-\nGAN [41] architecture as our discriminator.\nLoss function. The loss function of our GAN model5\nhas three terms: a GAN loss, an L1 loss, and an attention\nloss [17] to prevent the attention mask A from saturation,\nwhich also enforces the smoothness of the attention mask.\nDenoting the input rendered frames as r, the identity feature\nas f, and the ground truth real frames as g, the loss function\nis formulated as:\nL(G, D) = (Er,g[log D(r, g)] + Er[log(1 \u2212D(r, G(r, f)))])\n+ \u03bb1Er,g[||g \u2212G(r, f)||1] + \u03bb2Er[||A||2]\n+ \u03bb3Er[\nH,W\nX\ni,j\n(Ai+1,j \u2212Ai,j)2 + (Ai,j+1 \u2212Ai,j)2]\n(4)\n3. We use the cosine similarity for both spatial and identity features.\n4. An old pair is replaced when the similarity between current iden-\ntity feature and the closest identity feature is smaller than a threshold.\n5. Note that during the training process, the memory network is\nupdated separatedly and GAN is trained after each updating of the\nmemory network.\nWe train the GAN model to optimize the loss function:\nG\u2217= argmin\nG\nmax\nD L(G, D)\n(5)\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\nWe implemented our method in PyTorch. All experiments\nare performed on a PC with a Titan Xp GPU. The code is\npublicly available6. The dynamic results in this section can\nbe found in accompanying demo video7.\n4.1\nExperiment setup\nIn our model, the two components (audio to expression and\npose by LSTM, and memory-augmented GAN) involves two\ntraining steps: (1) a general mapping trained by the LRW\nvideo dataset [3] and (2) \ufb01ne tuning the general mapping to\nlearn the personalized talking behavior. At the \ufb01ne tuning\nstep, we collect 15 real-world talking face videos of single\nperson from Youtube. In each video, we use its \ufb01rst 12\nseconds (about 300 frames) as the training data. Given the\nwell-trained general mapping, we observe that 300 frames8\nare suf\ufb01cient for the \ufb01ne tuning task. In Section 4.3, we\nevaluate our personalized \ufb01ne tuning effect (see Figure 3 for\ntwo examples) on both the audio from the original Youtube\nvideo and the audio from the VoxCeleb and TCD dataset.\nBelow we denote the general mapping and \ufb01ne-tuned per-\nsonalized mapping as Ours-G and Ours-P, respectively. The\nnetwork is \ufb01rst trained in Ours-G (using general dataset)\nand then \ufb01ne-tuned in Ours-P (for a speci\ufb01c person).\nIn our experiments, the parameters in Eq.(2) is \u03bb1 = 0.2,\n\u03bb2 = 0.01 and \u03bb3 = 0.0001. The parameters in Eq.(4) is\n\u03bb1 = 100, \u03bb2 = 2, \u03bb3 = 1e \u22125. Our method works well\nfor people of different races and ages. Some examples are\nillustrated in Figure 4.\n6. https://github.com/yiranran/Audio-driven-TalkingFace-HeadPose\n7. https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/\u223cYongjin/Yongjin.htm\n8.

Ablation study. The \ufb01rst row shows the ground truth video (a\nsegment from Youtube video). The second row shows the generated\nresults without pose estimation in the \ufb01rst stage. The third row shows\nthe generated results by excluding the identity feature from input of GAN\nand the memory network from the GAN model. The last low shows the\nresults of our full model.\n4.2\nAblation study\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, our method involves two stages.\nHere we evaluate the importance of these two stages.\nIn the \ufb01rst stage, we predict both the head pose and\nexpression from the input audio. If we only predict the\nexpression without the pose estimation, as shown in the\nsecond row of Figure 5, the generated results are good in\nlip synchronization, but look rigid due to the \ufb01xed head\nposition, which is far from natural.\nThere are two distinct characteristics in the second stage.\nFirst we include the identity feature in the input of GAN.\nSecond, we add a memory network in the GAN model to\nstore representative identities in the training set and retrieve\nthe best-matched identity feature during the test. If we\nexclude the identity feature from input and the memory\nnetwork from the GAN model, the personalized re\ufb01ning\neffect of different identities and expressions would be the\nsame and then the network can not be well optimized.\nAs shown in the third row of Figure 5, without them,\nthe generated results have bad mouth details (e.g., strange\nteeth), uneven cheek areas, and black spots on face. If we\nexclude the memory network from the GAN model but\nkeep the identity feature input, and use the mean of identity\nfeatures in \ufb01ne tuning, the results (the middle row in Figure\n6) are not as good as our results (the last row in Figure 6),\nReal video\nReplacing\nMemNet\nBy using\nMean identity\nOurs-P\nFig. 6.

The last low shows the results of our model.\nwhich have much better \ufb01ne details (e.g., wrinkles) and look\nmore realistic.\n4.3\nComparison with state of the arts\nAs mentioned in Section 4.1, our model involves two impor-\ntant mappings: Ours-G and Ours-P. Note that (1) the inputs\nto the personalized mapping Ours-P are a short video of 300\nframes (to \ufb01ne-tune) and an audio, and (2) the inputs to the\ngeneral mapping Ours-G are only one frame (since it does\nnot need to \ufb01ne-tune) and an audio.\nIn this section, we show that the Ours-P model can gen-\nerate realistic talking face video with more distinguishing\nhead movement effects than the state-of-the-art methods.\nEven for the degenerate case that uses a single face image\nas input, the Ours-G model can generate comparable lip\nsynchronization with previous methods.\n4.3.1\nComparison with Ours-P\nWe \ufb01rst compare Ours-P with three state-of-the-art audio-\ndriven talking face generation methods: YouSaidThat [4],\nDAVS [9] and ATVG [2]. These three methods are all 2D-\nbased and operate on the image directly, i.e., without using\n3D face geometry and rendering. Thus their inputs include\nonly one facial image and an audio. We emphasize that the\nhead positions in the results output from these methods are\n8\nReal video\nDAVS\nATVG\nYou said that\nOurs-P\nFig. 7. Qualitative results of our method and state-of-the-art methods. The \ufb01rst row shows two ground-truth videos (segments from Youtube videos)\nand the other rows show the results of different methods (DAVS [9], You said that [4], ATVG [2] and Ours-P). Our method achieves good image\nquality, lip synchronization (w.r.t. real video) and personalized head movements.\n\ufb01xed. Although Ours-P takes more frames (for the purpose\nof \ufb01ne-tuning) as input, we learn personalized head pose.\nSome qualitative results are shown in Figure 7.\nIt is very challenging to evaluate the visual quality and\nnaturalness of synthesized videos, in particular regarding\nthe human face. We therefore design a user study to perform\nthe assessment based on subjective score evaluation. To\n\ufb01ne tune the network by considering personalized talking\nbehavior, we collect 15 real-world talking face videos and\nuse the portion of their \ufb01rst 12 seconds for training 15\npersonalized mappings. In our user study, for each of these\n15 personalized mappings, we test two sets of audio: one is\nthe audio from the remaining portions of the original real\nvideos, and the other is an audio chosen from VoxCeleb [58]\nor TCD [59]. We choose these two datasets because they\nhave a long audio segment to better visualize the change of\nhead pose. Then we can construct 30 comparison groups.\nEach group have \ufb01ve videos: one original video and four\ngenerated videos by four methods. Each personalized video\ndevotes to two groups, based on its two sets of audios.\n20 participants attended the user study and each of them\ncompared all 30 groups and answered 3 questions for each\ngroup. For a fair comparison, each group is presented by\na randomly shuf\ufb02ed order of \ufb01ve videos. Participants are\nasked to select the best video according to three criteria:\nimage quality, lip synchronization and the naturalness of\ntalking. The results of subjective scores are summarized in\nTable 1, showing that our method achieves better perfor-\nmance in all three criteria.\nTABLE 1\nSubjective score evaluation of our method and state-of-the-art\nmethods.

We directly compare the generated results by\ndifferent methods with the ground-truth videos.\nWe follow ATVG [2] to apply three widely used metrics\nfor audio-driven talking face generation evaluation, i.e., the\nclassic PSNR and SSIM metrics for image quality evaluation,\n9\nReal video\nDAVS\nATVG\nYou said that\nOurs-G\nFig. 8.

The results are summarized in Table 2,\nshowing that our method has the best PSNR values and has\ncomparable SSIM and LMD metric values with ATVG [2].\nSome qualitative comparisons are shown in Figure 8.\n4.4\nAnalysis of head pose behavior\nTo objectively evaluate the quality of personalized head\npose, we propose a new metric HS to measure the sim-\nilarity of head poses between the generated video and\nreal video. We use the three Euler angles to model head\nmovements [61], i.e., pitch, yaw, and roll corresponding to\nthe movement of head nod, head shake/turn, and head tilt,\nrespectively. We compute a histogram Preal of pose angles in\nreal personalized video, and a histogram Pgen of pose angles\nin the generated video. Then we compute the normalized\nWasserstein distance W1 [62] between Preal and Pgen. The\nlower the distance, the more similar the two head pose\ndistribution. Our new metric HS is formulated as\nHS = 1 \u2212W1(Preal, Pgen)\n(6)\nwhere HS is in the range [0, 1] and larger HS indicates\nhigher similarity of head pose. The average HS score of 15\npairs of personalized videos is 0.859, and the maximum and\nminimum score are 0.956 and 0.702 respectively, showing\nthat our generated video has a high similarity to real video\nin term of head movement behavior.\nTo evaluate the validity of this new metric, we further\nperform another user study to examine the correlation be-\ntween the subjective evaluation and our metric values. 20\nparticipants attended this user study. Each participant was\nasked to compare 15 pairs of generated videos and real\nvideos. They ranked from 1 to 5 based on the head pose\nsimilarity of the two videos (1-not similar, 2-maybe not sim-\nilar, 3-don\u2019t know, 4-maybe similar, 5-similar). The results of\nvotes (in parentheses) are 1 (25), 2 (47), 3 (35), 4 (110) and 5\n(83). The average score is 3.60, and the percentage of scores\n4 and 5 (\u2018maybe similar\u2019 and \u2018similar\u2019) is 64.3%. Only 24.0%\nranks are \u2018not similar\u2019 or \u2018maybe not similar\u2019. Furthermore,\nthe correlation coef\ufb01cient between subjective ranking and\nthe HS metric is 0.65, demonstrating that our metric has\nstrong positive correlation with human perception.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we propose a deep neural network model that\ngenerates a high-quality talking face video of a target person\nwho speaks the audio of a source person. Since natural talk-\ning head poses often cause in-plane and out-of-plane head\nrotations, to overcome the dif\ufb01culty of rendering a realistic\nframes directly from input video to output video, we recon-\nstruct the 3D face and use the 3D facial animation to bridge\nthe gap between audio-visual-driven head pose learning\nand realistic talking face video generation. The 3D facial\nanimation incorporates personalized head pose and is re-\nrendered into video frames using a graphic engine. Finally\nthe rendered frames are \ufb01ne-tuned into realistic ones using\na memory-augmented GAN module. Experiments results\n10\nand user studies show that our method can generate high-\nquality talking head video with personalized head pose, and\nthis distinct feature has not been considered in state-of-the-\nart audio-driven talking face generation methods.\nAPPENDIX A\nCORRELATION BETWEEN AUDIO AND HEAD POSE\nOur proposed deep network model learns a mapping from\naudio features to facial expression and head pose. We infer\nthe head pose from an audio, based on the observation that\nthe speaking style of a person in a short period is often\nconsistent. In our model, we have two training steps: (1) a\ngeneral mapping trained by LRW, and (2) \ufb01ne-tuning step\nusing a short video of the target person as the training data.\nThe head pose pose estimation of the target person is mainly\nlearned during the \ufb01ne-tuning step, because LRW includes\ndifferent person\u2019s data and their head movements vary; so\nwe design to learn the head movement behavior from the\nshort video of the target person.\nTo verify the observation that we can infer the head pose\nfrom the audio features, we conduct a correlation analysis\nbetween the audio and pose in these short videos. We\nrepresent the audio using the MFCC feature and represent\nthe pose using the three Eular angles (i.e., pitch, yaw, roll).\nFor a MFCC feature s, we \ufb01nd all MFCC features in the\nsame short video that are in its local neighborhood, and\ncalculate the distance between the neighboring MFCC pair\nand the distance between the corresponding poses. We\ncalculate the correlation between these two distances using\na spherical neighborhood with radius= 0.5\u2217|s|. The average\ncorrelation coef\ufb01cient of 15 short videos is 0.45, and the\nmaximum and minimum correlation coef\ufb01cients are 0.58\nand 0.24 respectively. These results indicate there exists a\npositive correlation between the audio and pose.\nAPPENDIX B\nUSER STUDY ON THE LENGTH OF INPUT SHORT\nVIDEO\nIn our method, we use a short video of a target person to\n\ufb01ne tune the general mapping into a personalized mapping,\nwhich learns personalized talking behavior. Here, we study\nthe relation between the length of the input short video and\nthe quality of the output talking face video. We generate the\nresults by inputting short videos of different lengths, i.e.,\n4s (100 frames), 8s (200 frames), 12s (300 frames), 20s (500\nframes), and 32s (800 frames). Some qualitative results are\nshown in Figure 9.\nWe \ufb01rst conducted an expert interview and asked an\nexpert who is good at video quality assessment to choose\nthe results that have the best quality and explain why. The\nexpert chose the results trained by 300, 500 and 800 frames,\nand the reason was that the results trained with less frames\nhave obviously lower image quality around the mouth and\nteeth areas, and somehow look strange.\nThen we further conducted the following user study.\nWe asked each user to (1) watch a real video, (2) watch\nthe results generated by the model trained with N\n=\n100, 200, 300, 500, 800 frames, and (3) select the best ones (in\nterms of visual quality) from generated results. Note that in\nReal video\nTraining by\nframes\nN=100\nTraining by\nframes\nN=200\nTraining by\nframes\nN=300\n(Ours-P)\nTraining by\nframes\nN=500\nTraining by\nframes\nN=800\nFig. 9. Study on the relation between the length of the input short video\nand the quality of generated results. The \ufb01rst row shows the ground\ntruth video (a segment from Youtube video). The remaining rows show\nresults using the personalized mapping trained by a short video of 100,\n200, 300, 500 and 800 frames respectively.\nour user study, more than one result can be selected as the\nbest; i.e., the user can select multiple results that have the\nsame best quality. 11 participants attended this user study.\nFor the results generated with N = 100, 200, 300, 500, 800\nframes, 0%, 0%, 36.4%, 36.4%, 63.6% users selected them as\nthe best one, respectively. These results validated that the\nmodels trained by less than 300 frames produce apparently\nworse results and the model trained by 300 frames achieves\na good balance between visual quality and computational\nef\ufb01ciency (using fewer frames for training).\nDiscussion on frame numbers in personalized and\ngeneral mapping. N = 100 generates low video quality,\npossibly because in the personalized mapping (i.e. \ufb01ne-\ntuning by the input short video), we use the low-frequency\nalbedo (to tolerate the change of head pose), and it requires\nmore frames to \ufb01ne-tune the low-frequency albedo into\nrealistic ones. While in the general mapping (i.e. trained\nby LRW, without \ufb01ne-tuning by the short video), we use\nthe detailed albedo. So using only one frame in the general\nmapping may generate a little bit more realistic results than\nusing a few frames (e.g., 10-30 frames) to \ufb01ne-tune the\nalbedo in the personalized mapping.\n11\nREFERENCES\n[1]\nJ.

    "1904.02892": "arXiv:1904.02892v2  [cs.SD]  9 Apr 2019\nWaveCycleGAN2: Time-domain Neural Post-\ufb01lter\nfor Speech Waveform Generation\nKou Tanaka, Hirokazu Kameoka, Takuhiro Kaneko, Nobukatsu Hojo\nNTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan\n{kou.tanaka.ef, hirokazu.kameoka.uh,\ntakuhiro.kaneko.tb, nobukatsu.houjou.ae}@hco.ntt.co.jp\nAbstract\nWaveCycleGAN has recently been proposed to bridge the gap\nbetween natural and synthesized speech waveforms in statisti-\ncal parametric speech synthesis and provides fast inference with\na moving average model rather than an autoregressive model\nand high-quality speech synthesis with the adversarial train-\ning. However, the human ear can still distinguish the processed\nspeech waveforms from natural ones. One possible cause of\nthis distinguishability is the aliasing observed in the processed\nspeech waveform via down/up-sampling modules.\nTo solve\nthe aliasing and provide higher quality speech synthesis, we\npropose WaveCycleGAN2, which 1) uses generators without\ndown/up-sampling modules and 2) combines discriminators of\nthe waveform domain and acoustic parameter domain. The re-\nsults show that the proposed method 1 1) alleviates the alias-\ning well, 2) is useful for both speech waveforms generated by\nanalysis-and-synthesis and statistical parametric speech synthe-\nsis, and 3) achieves a mean opinion score comparable to those\nof natural speech and speech synthesized by WaveNet [1] (open\nWaveNet [2]) and WaveGlow [3] while processing speech sam-\nples at a rate of more than 150 kHz on an NVIDIA Tesla P100.\nIndex Terms: speech synthesis, generative models, deep learn-\ning, vocoder, text-to-speech\n1. Introduction\nSpeech processing systems using classical parametric vocoder\nframeworks such as STRAIGHT [4, 5] and WORLD [6] are\npopular frameworks for various tasks such as statistical para-\nmetric speech synthesis (SPSS) [7] and statistical voice conver-\nsion (VC) [8]. The key advantage of using the classical para-\nmetric vocoder frameworks is that speech signals can be repre-\nsented by interpretable and compact acoustic parameters such as\nthe fundamental frequency (F0) and Mel-cepstrum rather than\na short-term Fourier transform (STFT) spectrogram.\nOn the\nother hand, the critical drawback is that the generated speech\ncan usually be distinguished from natural speech due to vocod-\ning error [9], even through we only re-synthesize the speech\nwaveform from the analyzed acoustic parameter. Moreover, op-\nerating acoustic parameters and their statistics in SPSS and VC\nusually leads to an over-smoothing effect [9] and increases the\ndifferences between synthetic and natural speech.\nTo address these drawbacks, we previously proposed a\nlearning-based \ufb01lter of the time-domain, called WaveCycle-\nGAN [10], which allows us to convert a synthetic speech wave-\nform into a natural speech waveform using cycle-consistent ad-\nversarial networks with a fully convolutional architecture. The\ndif\ufb01culties of the waveform conversion within the deep learn-\ning approaches are the dif\ufb01culty of parallel data collection of\nspeech waveform and the ambiguity of the phase information\nof speech waveform. Notably, the phase ambiguity prevents\n1Audio\nsamples\ncan\nbe\naccessed\non\nour\nweb\npage:\nwww.kecl.ntt.co.jp/people/tanaka.ko/projects/wavecyclegan2/index.html\nproper learning of a mapping function from synthetic speech\nto natural speech (e.g., when we have two speech waveforms\nwith certain phase spectra and the reversed phase spectra in the\ntraining data of natural speech, minimizing the objective func-\ntion results in converting to silence). The cyclic model makes\nit possible to address these dif\ufb01culties of the operating wave-\nform. Moreover, WaveCycleGAN is trained within the adver-\nsarial learning, so no explicit assumption against speech wave-\nform is required.\nAs a result, by applying WaveCycleGAN\nto SPSS trained for a Japanese dataset, the \ufb01ltered speech has\nachieved a mean opinion score higher than 4. However, there\nis still a gap between natural speech and \ufb01ltered speech. In\nthe preliminary experiment, by applying WaveCycleGAN to the\nspeech waveform synthesized from acoustic parameters of nat-\nural speech, the \ufb01ltered speech was lower quality than the input\nof WaveCycleGAN. We found that one possible reason for the\ndifference and degradation in quality is the aliasing observed in\nthe \ufb01ltered speech waveform via down/up-sampling modules in\nmodel architectures.\nTo bridge the gap including the aliasing, we propose Wave-\nCycleGAN2, which is an improved variant of WaveCycleGAN\nthat 1) uses generators without down/up-sampling modules and\n2) combines discriminators of the waveform domain and acous-\ntic parameter domain such as Mel-spectrogram, Mel-frequency\ncepstral coef\ufb01cients, and phase spectrum. We analyzed the ef-\nfect of each technique on an internal Japanese speech dataset 2\nand a public domain English speech dataset [12]. Experimental\nevaluations showed that the proposed method 1) alleviates the\naliasing well, 2) is useful for both speech waveforms generated\nby analysis-and-synthesis (AnaSyn) and SPSS, and 3) achieves\na mean opinion score comparable to those of natural speech and\nspeech synthesized by WaveNet [1] (open WaveNet [2]) and\nWaveGlow [3] while processing audio samples at a rate of more\nthan 150 kHz on an NVIDIA Tesla P100.\n2. Related Works\n2.1. Vocoder for Waveform Generation\nTo generate a speech waveform from given acoustic param-\neters, neural-network-based waveform models [1, 3, 13, 14]\nhave been proposed and have performed outstandingly at nu-\nmerous tasks involving speech signal processing.\nThere are\ntwo types of neural-network-based waveform models: an au-\ntoregressive (AR) model [1, 13] and a moving-average (MA)\nmodel [3, 14] (a.k.a., non-AR model). As an AR model, al-\nthough the WaveNet [1] synthesizes speech with high \ufb01delity,\nits training procedure is complex 3 and its inference speed is\nquite slow because the AR process never allows us to infer sev-\neral waveform sampling points in parallel.\n2 On our web page, we used an alternative speech dataset, the CMU\nArctic database [11], which allows us to publish\n3 Generated speech sometimes collapses as reported by Wu et al.\n[15].\nFor MA models that allow us to parallelize the inference,\ndistilled models [16, 17] demanding complex training criteria\nhave also been proposed. To avoid the complex training crite-\nria, WaveGlow [3] is a theoretically powerful model that has\nthe tractability of the exact log-likelihood. Although WaveG-\nlow makes it possible to train the theoretically exact mapping\nfunction by using only one criterion, it requires large-scale com-\nputational resources and long training time. To make the infer-\nence procedure interpretable, a neural source \ufb01lter model [14]\nhas also been proposed as an MA model. All these models can\nwork well if the given acoustic parameters are close to natural\nones seen in the training data. Otherwise, the training procedure\nhas to be several steps rather than one step because it is com-\nbined with other training procedures such as \ufb01ne-tuning [18]\nor methods described in the next subsection. In contrast, even\nif the given acoustic parameters are not close to natural ones\nin the training data, our approach, which is a kind of the MA\nmodel, makes it possible to directly train the mapping function\nfrom the generated speech waveform to the natural one in one\nstep because it allows the use of a classical parametric vocoder\nthat is not necessary to train.\n2.2. Acoustic Parameter Generation/Modi\ufb01cation\nTo address the over-smoothing effect [9], several techniques\nhave been proposed [8, 19, 20] to restore the \ufb01ne structure\nof acoustic parameters of natural speech 4.\nIn their respec-\ntive directions, these approaches have signi\ufb01cantly improved\nthe naturalness of acoustic parameters generated by SPSS and\nVC. However, these approaches are still insuf\ufb01cient to gener-\nate natural-sounding speech because of the post-\ufb01lter of acous-\ntic parameters on the heuristically limited compact space even\nin the generative adversarial nets (GAN) based approach [20].\nMoreover, it is impossible to address the vocoding error [9]\nwhen we use the classical parametric vocoder to generate the\nspeech waveform. In contrast, our approach allows us to ad-\ndress both the over-smoothing effect and vocoding error be-\ncause of the processing after waveform generation processing.\n3. Conventional WaveCycleGAN\nWe brie\ufb02y review our previous work, WaveCycleGAN [10],\nwhich is a kind of cyclic model (a.k.a., dual learning [24]).\nLet us use one-dimensional vectors x and y to denote\nsequences belonging to sets of synthetic X and natural Y\nspeech waveforms, respectively. Inspired by CycleGAN [25],\nWaveCycleGAN uses three training criteria (adversarial loss\nLadv [26], cycle-consistency loss Lcyc [27], and identity-\nmapping loss Lid [28]) to train a mapping function GX\u2192Y that\nconverts the waveform of synthetic speech into that of natural\nspeech without relying on parallel data.\nThe adversarial loss is written as,\nLadv(GX\u2192Y ,DY ) = Ey\u223cPY (y)[log DY (y)]\n+ Ex\u223cPX(x)[log(1 \u2212DY (GX\u2192Y (x)))], (1)\nwhere DY indicates a discriminator trying to differentiate be-\ntween a real sample y and the samples GX\u2192Y (x) converted\nby the generator GX\u2192Y while GX\u2192Y is trained for convert-\ning x to GX\u2192Y (x) that can deceive DY as y. This criterion\nfocuses on only whether it can deceive DY or not, so x might\nbe converted into samples that have different linguistic infor-\nmation. To retain the linguistic information of the input x, the\n4 Of course, accurate modeling approaches have also been proposed,\nsuch as generative adversarial network-based text-to-speech [21,22] and\nvoice conversion [23].\ncycle-consistency and identity-mapping losses are used:\nLcyc = Ex\u223cPX(x)[||GY \u2192X(GX\u2192Y (x)) \u2212x||1]\n+ Ey\u223cPY (y)[||GX\u2192Y (GY \u2192X(y)) \u2212y||1],\n(2)\nLid = Ey\u223cPY (y)[||GX\u2192Y (y) \u2212y||1]\n+ Ex\u223cPX(x)[||GY \u2192X(x)) \u2212x||1],\n(3)\nwhere GY \u2192X indicates another generator that has the reverse\ndirection to GX\u2192Y . Note that to guide the learning direction,\nLid is usually used only in the early stage of the training.\nFinally, the full objective function can be written as\nLfull = Ladv(GX\u2192Y , DY ) + Ladv(GY \u2192X, DX)\n+ \u03bbcycLcyc + \u03bbidLid,\n(4)\nwhere \u03bbcyc and \u03bbid indicate hyperparameters controlling the\ncycle-consistency and identity-mapping losses.\n4. Proposed WaveCycleGAN2\n4.1. Aliasing Issue of Conventional WaveCycleGAN\nMany model architectures using convolutional neural net-\nworks involve down/up-sampling modules as the de facto stan-\ndard [29\u201332] because it has a signi\ufb01cant advantage in terms\nof the computation amount. We also adopted convolution with\nstrides to WaveCycleGAN because of its computational advan-\ntage. As a result, we achieved a mean opinion score higher than\n4 in terms of the naturalness. However, we found that aliasing is\nobserved in the processed speech waveform, as shown in Fig. 1\n(c). This phenomenon has also been reported in several other\ntasks such as image classi\ufb01cation [33] and deep speech pro-\ncessing [34]. The aliasing occurs when the Nyquist-Shannon\nsampling theorem [35] is not satis\ufb01ed, so it follows that the\nclassical convolution with strides is not guaranteed to satisfy\nthe sampling theorem. This is reasonable because the classi-\ncal convolution with strides is not guaranteed to have an anti-\naliasing mechanism while we never perform down-sampling\nwithout anti-aliasing processing in the pure signal processing.\nNote that in acoustic parameter trajectory smoothing [36], the\nacoustic parameter differences in high modulation frequency 5\nare hardly perceived by humans. Therefore, even if the aliasing\noccurs on the acoustic parameter sequence, we will not notice it.\nThe aliasing issue is a problem speci\ufb01c to the waveform conver-\nsion. To generate more natural-sounding speech, this aliasing\nissue remains to be solved.\n4.2. Improved Generator: Addressing Aliasing Issue\nTo alleviate the aliasing described in Sec. 4.1, we have two op-\ntions. One is to explicitly add anti-aliasing processing into the\nmodel architecture. Following this concept, a linear pooling\nwith Gaussian weights has been proposed [37]. This pooling\noperation is equivalent to the down-sampling after Gaussian \ufb01l-\ntering. We can regard the Gaussian \ufb01ltering as the approxima-\ntion of low-pass \ufb01ltering using the cardinal sine function (a.k.a.,\nsinc function) so that the aliasing will be alleviated well. How-\never, there is a fundamental trade-off between the performance\nand the combination of shift invariance and anti-aliasing.\nAnother option is to use a dilated convolution [38], which\nis introduced to the deep learning for semantic image segmen-\ntation, rather than the classical convolution with strides. This\nis a technique to reduce the number of model parameters and\nobtain the computational ef\ufb01ciency while maintaining a large\nreceptive \ufb01eld to cater for long-range dependencies. Note that\n5 Modulation frequency is the frequency of modulation spectra,\nwhich are the power spectra of a given acoustic parameter sequence.\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n1\n2\n4\n8\nFrequency [kHz]\n(a) Recorded\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n(b) SPSS\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\nTime [s]\n(c) V1\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n(d) V2\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n(e) V2msp\nFigure 1: Spectrogram of natural waveform and waveforms generated from models in Sec. 5.1.2. Dashed red box indicates aliasing.\nthe recent neural-network-based vocoder such as WaveNet has\nalso adopted the dilated convolution.\nToward a high-quality\nneural post-\ufb01lter for speech waveform generation, assuming\nthat down/up-sampling modules are not suitable for the speech\nwaveform conversion unlike acoustic parameter conversion, we\nreplace the classical convolution with the dilated convolution in\nthe architecture of WaveCycleGAN.\n4.3. Improved Discriminator: Multiple Domains\nIn the preliminary experiment, although using the dilated con-\nvolution instead of the convolution with strides made it possible\nto alleviate the aliasing, the processed speech somehow became\nnoisy speech, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). Theoretically, the gen-\nerator should imitate a p.d.f. of the real data if the training\nsucceeds. However, in practice, the gradient of the generator\nvanishes when the discriminator successfully rejects generated\nsamples with high con\ufb01dence. For this reason, we used the dis-\ncriminators that have small model parameters, but this insuf\ufb01-\ncient capability of the discriminator might make the decision\nboundaries non-optimal.\nTo \ufb01nd the best decision boundaries while avoiding the van-\nishing gradient problem of the generator, we propose discrim-\ninators combining multiple domains such as the waveform do-\nmain DYwave and Mel spectrogram domain DYmsp as follows:\nLadv(GX\u2192Y , DY ) = Ey\u223cPY (y)[log DYwave(y)]\n+ Ey\u223cPY (y)[log DYmsp(F(y))]\n+ Ex\u223cPX(x)[log(1 \u2212DYwave(GX\u2192Y (x)))]\n+ Ex\u223cPX(x)[log(1 \u2212DYmsp(F(GX\u2192Y (x))))].\n(5)\nwhere F indicates a linear mapping function described as a con-\nvolution of the Hanning window, followed by a fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT) matrix and Mel-\ufb01lter bank.\nUnlike the L1\nand L2 losses on spectra [14, 16, 39], we use the adversarial\nlosses for the multiple domains, so the objective function re-\nlated to the generator still does not depend directly on y at all\nand our approach makes this objective function resistant to the\nover-smoothing problems [9] the same as conventional Wave-\nCycleGAN.\n5. Experiments\n5.1. SPSS using Internal Japanese Dataset\n5.1.1. Dataset\nWe used a Japanese speech dataset consisting of utterances by\none professional female narrator. To train the models, we used\nabout 6,500 sentences for a baseline system and 400 sentences\n(speech sections of 1.2 hours) each for WaveCycleGAN and\nWaveCycleGAN2. To evaluate the performance, we used 30\nsentences (speech sections of 5.3 minutes). The sampling rate\nof the speech signals was 22.05 kHz.\n5.1.2. Systems\nWe used a deep neural network (DNN)-based SPSS [7] and\nWaveCycleGAN [10] as a baseline system (SPSS) and a con-\nventional system (V1). As a proposed system, V2 indicates\nWaveCycleGAN2, which has only the speech waveform do-\nmain\u2019s discriminators. V2+ indicates WaveCycleGAN2 incor-\nporating the discriminators of the acoustic parameter domains\nsuch as the Mel spectrogram (V2msp), Mel-frequency cep-\nstrum coef\ufb01cients (V2mfcc), and phase spectrogram (V2ph).\nThe architecture of the generator was a linear projection (# of\nchannel, kernel, dilation: 64, 15, 1) followed by a residual block\n(128, 15, 2), \ufb01ve residual blocks (128, 15, 4), and a linear pro-\njection (1, 15, 1). We applied the conventional and proposed\nsystems to the speech waveform SPSS. We used the same learn-\ning rate for the \ufb01rst 80k iterations and linearly decayed to 0 over\nthe next 80k iterations. The other conditions are the same as in\nour previous work [10].\n5.1.3. Objective Evaluation\nTo evaluate the capability of addressing the over-smoothing ef-\nfect caused by the SPSS, we calculated modulation spectrum\ndifferences (MSD) for the Mel cepstral coef\ufb01cient of natural\nspeech (Recorded). Although the modulation spectrum is tra-\nditionally de\ufb01ned as a value calculated using the Fourier trans-\nform of the parameter sequence [40], this paper de\ufb01nes the\nmodulation spectrum as its logarithmic power spectrum. We\nused 8,192 FFT points.\nFigure 2 showed that SPSS signi\ufb01cantly suffered from\nthe over-smoothing effect.\nAlthough V1 alleviated its over-\nsmoothing effect, there was still a gap. On the other hand, V2+\nrestored the modulation spectrum of Recorded well. Note that\nas described in Sec. 4.3, the speech generated by V2 was more\ndifferent from natural speech than that generated by the combi-\nnation methods V2+.\n5.1.4. Subjective Evaluation\nWe conducted a listening test with a 5-scale mean opinion score\nregarding naturalness. On each system, 200 speech samples (10\nparticipants \u00d7 20 randomly selected speech samples) were eval-\nuated.\nFigure 3 showed that V1 signi\ufb01cantly improved the natu-\nralness of the generated speech compared with SPSS. V2msp\nand V2mfcc were closer to natural speech, and there is no sta-\ntistical difference from natural speech because p values of two-\nsided Mann-Whitney tests are more than 0.05. In contrast, V2\nsuffered from noisy speech. Note that the score of V2ph was\nsigni\ufb01cantly degraded because the silence sections somehow\nbecame quite noisy. These results suggest that it is better to\ncombine the waveform domain discriminator and the amplitude\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nMel-cepstral coefficient index\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\nMSD\nSPSS\nV1\nV2\nV2mfcc\nV2ph\nV2msp\nFigure 2: Modulation spectrum differences against for Mel cep-\nstral coef\ufb01cient of natural speech.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\nV2msp V2mfcc\nV1\nV2\nV2ph\nSPSS\n4.43\n4.29\n4.26\n4.13\n4.00\n2.93\n1.86\nMean opinion score\nSystems\nFigure 3: Subjective 5-scale mean opinion scores regarding nat-\nuralness, with 95% con\ufb01dence intervals.

Dataset\nWe used a public domain English speech dataset [12] containing\n13,100 utterances. To evaluate the performance, we used 40\nsentences disjoint from the training data. The sampling rate of\nthe speech signals was 22.05 kHz.\n5.2.2. Systems\nWe used WORLD [6] and Grif\ufb01n-Lim [41] vocoders as the\nparametric and phase vocoder, respectively.\nFor the neural-\nnetwork-based vocoder, we used open WaveNet [2] employ-\ning a mixture of logistics distribution [42] and of\ufb01cial Wave-\nGlow [3]. The audio samples of open WaveNet and of\ufb01cial\nWaveGlow were brought from a public folder 6 of R. Valle\nwho is a co-author of WaveGlow [3]. For the proposed method,\nwe used WaveCycleGAN2 incorporating the Mel spectrum do-\nmain discriminator V2msp.\nNote that our proposed method\nworked in both the parallel-data condition V2msp (paired) and\nnon-parallel-data condition V2msp (unpaired) where the mini-\nbatches of natural speech differed from those of synthesized\nspeech in every iteration.\n5.2.3. Objective and Subjective Evaluations\nTo evaluate the capability of WaveCycleGAN2 for an analysis-\nand-synthesis task, we calculated log spectral distortions (LSD)\nand conducted a listening test with 5-scale mean opinion scores\nregarding naturalness. On each system, 210 speech samples (14\nparticipants \u00d7 15 randomly selected speech samples) were eval-\nuated subjectively.\n6 Speech samples can be accessed in a public folder of Google\nDrive: http://bit.ly/2JTDetX\nTable 1: Log spectral distortions (LSD) and subjective 5-scale\nmean opinion scores regarding naturalness (Naturalness), with\n95% con\ufb01dence intervals.

On the other hand, WORLD had\nhigher the distortion because of the parametric vocoder. In the\ncomparison of open WaveNet and WaveGlow, open WaveNet\nhas larger distortion. One possible reason is that open WaveNet\nmight generate speech waveforms that have different amplitude\nspectra from the given acoustic parameter when the previous\noutputs are captured more strongly than the given acoustic pa-\nrameters. In contrast, V2msp has smaller distortion than Wave-\nGlow. This might be because WaveCycleGAN2 has the advan-\ntage of the speech waveform conversion where the input and\noutput domains are closer than those of WaveGlow.\nIn the results of the listening test, there is no statistical\ndifference in the only two pairs of WORLD-Grif\ufb01n-Lim and\nopen WaveNet-V2msp (unpaired) because p values of two-\nsided Mann-Whitney tests are more than 0.05. Remarkably,\nV2msp (paired) outperformed open WaveNet and WaveGlow.\nUnlike WaveGlow, our proposed method is speci\ufb01ed to work\non only speech signals whereas WaveGlow theoretically works\non not only speech signals but also audio signals such as mu-\nsic. Moreover, open WaveNet is not an of\ufb01cial implementa-\ntion, so this might not be the best result of WaveNet [1]. How-\never, these results are impressive, and we also had the following\nfeedback from the participants: 1) WaveGlow sometimes had\nartifacts like Grif\ufb01n-Lim, 2) open WaveNet sometimes had\nartifacts like the collapsed speech samples reported by Wu et\nal. [15], and 3) V2msp sometimes had artifacts caused by the\nunvoiced/voiced detection error of the WORLD vocoder. Note\nthat the tendency of the results compared with Recorded differs\nfrom the tendency described in Sec. 5.1.4 because the LJSpeech\ndataset [12] suffers from reverb.\n6. Conclusions\nWe proposed a time-domain neural post-\ufb01lter for speech wave-\nform generation, WaveCycleGAN2.\nExperimental results\ndemonstrated that the proposed method 1) outperformed the\nconventional WaveCycleGAN, 2) is useful for both speech\nwaveforms generated by analysis-and-synthesis and statistical\nparametric speech synthesis, and 3) generated speech wave-\nforms comparable to those of natural speech and speech synthe-\nsized by WaveNet [1] (open WaveNet [2]) and WaveGlow [3].\n7.

The training of FastSpeech model relies on an au-\ntoregressive teacher model for duration prediction (to provide more information\nas input) and knowledge distillation (to simplify the data distribution in out-\nput), which can ease the one-to-many mapping problem (i.e., multiple speech\nvariations correspond to the same text) in TTS. However, FastSpeech has sev-\neral disadvantages: 1) the teacher-student distillation pipeline is complicated and\ntime-consuming, 2) the duration extracted from the teacher model is not accu-\nrate enough, and the target mel-spectrograms distilled from teacher model suf-\nfer from information loss due to data simpli\ufb01cation, both of which limit the\nvoice quality. In this paper, we propose FastSpeech 2, which addresses the is-\nsues in FastSpeech and better solves the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS\nby 1) directly training the model with ground-truth target instead of the simpli-\n\ufb01ed output from teacher, and 2) introducing more variation information of speech\n(e.g., pitch, energy and more accurate duration) as conditional inputs. Speci\ufb01-\ncally, we extract duration, pitch and energy from speech waveform and directly\ntake them as conditional inputs in training and use predicted values in inference.\nWe further design FastSpeech 2s, which is the \ufb01rst attempt to directly generate\nspeech waveform from text in parallel, enjoying the bene\ufb01t of fully end-to-end\ninference. Experimental results show that 1) FastSpeech 2 achieves a 3x train-\ning speed-up over FastSpeech, and FastSpeech 2s enjoys even faster inference\nspeed; 2) FastSpeech 2 and 2s outperform FastSpeech in voice quality, and Fast-\nSpeech 2 can even surpass autoregressive models. Audio samples are available at\nhttps://speechresearch.github.io/fastspeech2/.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nNeural network based text to speech (TTS) has made rapid progress and attracted a lot of attention\nin the machine learning and speech community in recent years (Wang et al., 2017; Shen et al.,\n2018; Ming et al., 2016; Arik et al., 2017; Ping et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019).\nPrevious neural TTS models (Wang et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018; Ping et al., 2018; Li et al.,\n2019) \ufb01rst generate mel-spectrograms autoregressively from text and then synthesize speech from\nthe generated mel-spectrograms using a separately trained vocoder (Van Den Oord et al., 2016;\nOord et al., 2017; Prenger et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2018; Yamamoto et al., 2020; Kumar et al.,\n\u2217Authors contribute equally to this work.\n\u2020Corresponding author\n1\narXiv:2006.04558v8  [eess.AS]  8 Aug 2022\n2019). They usually suffer from slow inference speed and robustness (word skipping and repeating)\nissues (Ren et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). In recent years, non-autoregressive TTS models (Ren\net al., 2019; \u0141a\u00b4ncucki, 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Lim et al., 2020; Miao et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019)\nare designed to address these issues, which generate mel-spectrograms with extremely fast speed\nand avoid robustness issues, while achieving comparable voice quality with previous autoregressive\nmodels.\nAmong those non-autoregressive TTS methods, FastSpeech (Ren et al., 2019) is one of the most\nsuccessful models. FastSpeech designs two ways to alleviate the one-to-many mapping problem:\n1) Reducing data variance in the target side by using the generated mel-spectrogram from an au-\ntoregressive teacher model as the training target (i.e., knowledge distillation). 2) Introducing the\nduration information (extracted from the attention map of the teacher model) to expand the text se-\nquence to match the length of the mel-spectrogram sequence. While these designs in FastSpeech\nease the learning of the one-to-many mapping problem (see Section 2.1) in TTS, they also bring\nseveral disadvantages: 1) The two-stage teacher-student training pipeline makes the training process\ncomplicated. 2) The target mel-spectrograms generated from the teacher model have some informa-\ntion loss1 compared with the ground-truth ones, since the quality of the audio synthesized from the\ngenerated mel-spectrograms is usually worse than that from the ground-truth ones. 3) The duration\nextracted from the attention map of teacher model is not accurate enough.\nIn this work, we propose FastSpeech 2 to address the issues in FastSpeech and better handle the\none-to-many mapping problem in non-autoregressive TTS. To simplify the training pipeline and\navoid the information loss due to data simpli\ufb01cation in teacher-student distillation, we directly train\nthe FastSpeech 2 model with ground-truth target instead of the simpli\ufb01ed output from a teacher.\nTo reduce the information gap (input does not contain all the information to predict the target) be-\ntween the input (text sequence) and target output (mel-spectrograms) and alleviate the one-to-many\nmapping problem for non-autoregressive TTS model training, we introduce some variation infor-\nmation of speech including pitch, energy and more accurate duration into FastSpeech: in training,\nwe extract duration, pitch and energy from the target speech waveform and directly take them as\nconditional inputs; in inference, we use values predicted by the predictors that are jointly trained\nwith the FastSpeech 2 model. Considering the pitch is important for the prosody of speech and\nis also dif\ufb01cult to predict due to the large \ufb02uctuations along time, we convert the pitch contour\ninto pitch spectrogram using continuous wavelet transform (Tuteur, 1988; Grossmann & Morlet,\n1984) and predict the pitch in the frequency domain, which can improve the accuracy of predicted\npitch. To further simplify the speech synthesis pipeline, we introduce FastSpeech 2s, which does\nnot use mel-spectrograms as intermediate output and directly generates speech waveform from\ntext in inference, enjoying low latency in inference. Experiments on the LJSpeech (Ito, 2017)\ndataset show that 1) FastSpeech 2 enjoys much simpler training pipeline (3x training time reduc-\ntion) than FastSpeech while inherits its advantages of fast, robust and controllable (even more\ncontrollable in pitch and energy) speech synthesis, and FastSpeech 2s enjoys even faster infer-\nence speed; 2) FastSpeech 2 and 2s outperform FastSpeech in voice quality, and FastSpeech 2 can\neven surpass autoregressive models. We attach audio samples generated by FastSpeech 2 and 2s at\nhttps://speechresearch.github.io/fastspeech2/.\nThe main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 FastSpeech 2 achieves a 3x training speed-up over FastSpeech by simplifying the training pipeline.\n\u2022 FastSpeech 2 alleviates the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS and achieves better voice qual-\nity.\n\u2022 FastSpeech 2s further simpli\ufb01es the inference pipeline for speech synthesis while maintaining\nhigh voice quality, by directly generating speech waveform from text.\n2\nFASTSPEECH 2 AND 2S\nIn this section, we \ufb01rst describe the motivation of the design in FastSpeech 2, and then introduce\nthe architecture of FastSpeech 2, which aims to improve FastSpeech to better handle the one-to-\n1The speech generated by the teacher model loses some variation information about pitch, energy, prosody,\netc., and is much simpler and less diverse than the original recording in the training data.\n2\nMel-spectrogram\nDecoder\nEncoder\nPhoneme Embedding\nPhoneme\nVariance Adaptor\nWaveform \nDecoder\nFastSpeech 2s\nConv1D + ReLU\nLinear Layer\nPositional\nEncoding\nPositional\nEncoding\nPitch Predictor\nEnergy Predictor\n\u2026 Predictor\nPitch\nEnergy\nDuration Predictor\nLN + Dropout\nConv1D + ReLU \nLN + Dropout\nDuration\nTransposed Conv1D \nDilated Conv1D\nGated Activation\nConv 1x1\nConv1D \nx N\nLR\n(a) FastSpeech 2\nMel-spectrogram\nDecoder\nEncoder\nPhoneme Embedding\nPhoneme\nVariance Adaptor\nWaveform \nDecoder\nFastSpeech 2s\nConv1D + ReLU\nLinear Layer\nPositional\nEncoding\nPositional\nEncoding\nPitch Predictor\nEnergy Predictor\n\u2026 Predictor\nPitch\nEnergy\nDuration Predictor\nLN + Dropout\nConv1D + ReLU \nLN + Dropout\nDuration\nTransposed Conv1D \nDilated Conv1D\nGated Activation\nConv 1x1\nConv1D \nx N\nLR\n(b) Variance adaptor\nMel-spectrogram\nDecoder\nEncoder\nPhoneme Embedding\nPhoneme\nVariance Adaptor\nWaveform \nDecoder\nFastSpeech 2s\nConv1D + ReLU\nLinear Layer\nPositional\nEncoding\nPositional\nEncoding\nPitch Predictor\nEnergy Predictor\n\u2026 Predictor\nPitch\nEnergy\nDuration Predictor\nLN + Dropout\nConv1D + ReLU \nLN + Dropout\nDuration\nTransposed Conv1D \nDilated Conv1D\nGated Activation\nConv 1x1\nConv1D \nx N\nLR\n(c)\nDuration/pitch/energy\npredictor\nMel-spectrogram\nDecoder\nEncoder\nPhoneme Embedding\nPhoneme\nVariance Adaptor\nWaveform \nDecoder\nFastSpeech 2s\nConv1D + ReLU\nLinear Layer\nPositional\nEncoding\nPositional\nEncoding\nPitch Predictor\nEnergy Predictor\n\u2026 Predictor\nPitch\nEnergy\nDuration Predictor\nLN + Dropout\nConv1D + ReLU \nLN + Dropout\nDuration\nTransposed Conv1D \nDilated Conv1D\nGated Activation\nConv 1x1\nConv1D \nx N\nLR\n(d) Waveform decoder\nFigure 1: The overall architecture for FastSpeech 2 and 2s.

At last, we extend\nFastSpeech 2 to FastSpeech 2s for fully end-to-end text-to-waveform synthesis2.\n2.1\nMOTIVATION\nTTS is a typical one-to-many mapping problem (Wang et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017; Jayne et al.,\n2012; Gadermayr et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021), since multiple possible speech sequences can\ncorrespond to a text sequence due to variations in speech, such as pitch, duration, sound volume and\nprosody. In non-autoregressive TTS, the only input information is text which is not enough to fully\npredict the variance in speech. In this case, the model is prone to over\ufb01t to the variations of the\ntarget speech in the training set, resulting in poor generalization ability. As mentioned in Section\n1, although FastSpeech designs two ways to alleviate the one-to-many mapping problem, they also\nbring about several issues including 1) the complicated training pipeline; 2) information loss of\ntarget mel-spectrogram as analyzed in Table 1; and 3) not accurate enough ground-truth duration as\nshown in Table 5a. In the following subsection, we introduce the detailed design of FastSpeech 2\nwhich aims to address these issues.\n2.2\nMODEL OVERVIEW\nThe overall model architecture of FastSpeech 2 is shown in Figure 1a. The encoder converts the\nphoneme embedding sequence into the phoneme hidden sequence, and then the variance adaptor\nadds different variance information such as duration, pitch and energy into the hidden sequence,\n\ufb01nally the mel-spectrogram decoder converts the adapted hidden sequence into mel-spectrogram\nsequence in parallel.\nWe use the feed-forward Transformer block, which is a stack of self-\nattention (Vaswani et al., 2017) layer and 1D-convolution as in FastSpeech (Ren et al., 2019), as\nthe basic structure for the encoder and mel-spectrogram decoder. Different from FastSpeech that re-\nlies on a teacher-student distillation pipeline and the phoneme duration from a teacher model, Fast-\nSpeech 2 makes several improvements. First, we remove the teacher-student distillation pipeline,\nand directly use ground-truth mel-spectrograms as target for model training, which can avoid the\ninformation loss in distilled mel-spectrograms and increase the upper bound of the voice quality.\nSecond, our variance adaptor consists of not only duration predictor but also pitch and energy\npredictors, where 1) the duration predictor uses the phoneme duration obtained by forced align-\nment (McAuliffe et al., 2017) as training target, which is more accurate than that extracted from the\nattention map of autoregressive teacher model as veri\ufb01ed experimentally in Section 3.2.2; and 2) the\n2In this work, text-to-waveform refers to phoneme-to-waveform, while our method can also be appied to\ncharacter-level sequence directly.\n3\nadditional pitch and energy predictors can provide more variance information, which is important\nto ease the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS. Third, to further simplify the training pipeline\nand push it towards a fully end-to-end system, we propose FastSpeech 2s, which directly generates\nwaveform from text, without cascaded mel-spectrogram generation (acoustic model) and waveform\ngeneration (vocoder). In the following subsections, we describe detailed designs of the variance\nadaptor and direct waveform generation in our method.\n2.3\nVARIANCE ADAPTOR\nThe variance adaptor aims to add variance information (e.g., duration, pitch, energy, etc.) to the\nphoneme hidden sequence, which can provide enough information to predict variant speech for the\none-to-many mapping problem in TTS. We brie\ufb02y introduce the variance information as follows:\n1) phoneme duration, which represents how long the speech voice sounds; 2) pitch, which is a key\nfeature to convey emotions and greatly affects the speech prosody; 3) energy, which indicates frame-\nlevel magnitude of mel-spectrograms and directly affects the volume and prosody of speech. More\nvariance information can be added in the variance adaptor, such as emotion, style and speaker, and\nwe leave it for future work. Correspondingly, the variance adaptor consists of 1) a duration predictor\n(i.e., the length regulator, as used in FastSpeech), 2) a pitch predictor, and 3) an energy predictor,\nas shown in Figure 1b. In training, we take the ground-truth value of duration, pitch and energy\nextracted from the recordings as input into the hidden sequence to predict the target speech. At\nthe same time, we use the ground-truth duration, pitch and energy as targets to train the duration,\npitch and energy predictors, which are used in inference to synthesize target speech. As shown\nin Figure 1c, the duration, pitch and energy predictors share similar model structure (but different\nmodel parameters), which consists of a 2-layer 1D-convolutional network with ReLU activation,\neach followed by the layer normalization and the dropout layer, and an extra linear layer to project\nthe hidden states into the output sequence. In the following paragraphs, we describe the details of\nthe three predictors respectively.\nDuration Predictor\nThe duration predictor takes the phoneme hidden sequence as input and pre-\ndicts the duration of each phoneme, which represents how many mel frames correspond to this\nphoneme, and is converted into logarithmic domain for ease of prediction. The duration predic-\ntor is optimized with mean square error (MSE) loss, taking the extracted duration as training tar-\nget. Instead of extracting the phoneme duration using a pre-trained autoregressive TTS model in\nFastSpeech, we use Montreal forced alignment (MFA) (McAuliffe et al., 2017) tool3 to extract the\nphoneme duration, in order to improve the alignment accuracy and thus reduce the information gap\nbetween the model input and output.\nPitch Predictor\nPrevious neural network based TTS systems with pitch prediction (Arik et al.,\n2017; Gibiansky et al., 2017) often predict pitch contour directly. However, due to high variations\nof ground-truth pitch, the distribution of predicted pitch values is very different from ground-truth\ndistribution, as analyzed in Section 3.2.2. To better predict the variations in pitch contour, we use\ncontinuous wavelet transform (CWT) to decompose the continuous pitch series into pitch spectro-\ngram (Suni et al., 2013; Hirose & Tao, 2015) and take the pitch spectrogram as the training target\nfor the pitch predictor which is optimized with MSE loss. In inference, the pitch predictor predicts\nthe pitch spectrogram, which is further converted back into pitch contour using inverse continuous\nwavelet transform (iCWT). We describe the details of pitch extraction, CWT, iCWT and pitch pre-\ndictor architecture in Appendix D. To take the pitch contour as input in both training and inference,\nwe quantize pitch F0 (ground-truth/predicted value for train/inference respectively) of each frame\nto 256 possible values in log-scale and further convert it into pitch embedding vector p and add it to\nthe expanded hidden sequence.\nEnergy Predictor\nWe compute L2-norm of the amplitude of each short-time Fourier transform\n(STFT) frame as the energy. Then we quantize energy of each frame to 256 possible values uni-\nformly, encoded it into energy embedding e and add it to the expanded hidden sequence similarly to\n3MFA is an open-source system for speech-text alignment with good performance, which can be trained on\npaired text-audio corpus without any manual alignment annotations. We train MFA on our training set only\nwithout other external dataset. We will work on non-autoregressive TTS without external alignment models in\nthe future.\n4\npitch. We use an energy predictor to predict the original values of energy instead of the quantized\nvalues and optimize the energy predictor with MSE loss4.\n2.4\nFASTSPEECH 2S\nTo enable fully end-to-end text-to-waveform generation, in this subsection, we extend FastSpeech 2\nto FastSpeech 2s, which directly generates waveform from text, without cascaded mel-spectrogram\ngeneration (acoustic model) and waveform generation (vocoder). As shown in Figure 1a, FastSpeech\n2s generates waveform conditioning on intermediate hidden, which makes it more compact in infer-\nence by discarding mel-spectrogram decoder and achieve comparable performance with a cascaded\nsystem. We \ufb01rst discuss the challenges in non-autoregressive text-to-waveform generation, then\ndescribe details of FastSpeech 2s, including model structure and training and inference processes.\nChallenges in Text-to-Waveform Generation\nWhen pushing TTS pipeline towards fully end-\nto-end framework, there are several challenges: 1) Since the waveform contains more variance\ninformation (e.g., phase) than mel-spectrograms, the information gap between the input and output\nis larger than that in text-to-spectrogram generation. 2) It is dif\ufb01cult to train on the audio clip\nthat corresponds to the full text sequence due to the extremely long waveform samples and limited\nGPU memory. As a result, we can only train on a short audio clip that corresponds to a partial text\nsequence which makes it hard for the model to capture the relationship among phonemes in different\npartial text sequences and thus harms the text feature extraction.\nOur Method\nTo tackle the challenges above, we make several designs in the waveform decoder: 1)\nConsidering that the phase information is dif\ufb01cult to predict using a variance predictor (Engel et al.,\n2020), we introduce adversarial training in the waveform decoder to force it to implicitly recover the\nphase information by itself (Yamamoto et al., 2020). 2) We leverage the mel-spectrogram decoder\nof FastSpeech 2, which is trained on the full text sequence to help on the text feature extraction.\nAs shown in Figure 1d, the waveform decoder is based on the structure of WaveNet (Van Den Oord\net al., 2016) including non-causal convolutions and gated activation (Van den Oord et al., 2016). The\nwaveform decoder takes a sliced hidden sequence corresponding to a short audio clip as input and\nupsamples it with transposed 1D-convolution to match the length of audio clip. The discriminator\nin the adversarial training adopts the same structure in Parallel WaveGAN (Yamamoto et al., 2020)\nwhich consists of ten layers of non-causal dilated 1-D convolutions with leaky ReLU activation\nfunction. The waveform decoder is optimized by the multi-resolution STFT loss and the LSGAN\ndiscriminator loss following Parallel WaveGAN. In inference, we discard the mel-spectrogram de-\ncoder and only use the waveform decoder to synthesize speech audio.\n2.5\nDISCUSSIONS\nIn this subsection, we discuss how FastSpeech 2 and 2s differentiate from previous and concurrent\nworks.\nCompared with Deep Voice (Arik et al., 2017), Deep Voice 2 (Gibiansky et al., 2017) and other\nmethods Fan et al. (2014); Ze et al. (2013) which generate waveform autoregressively and also pre-\ndict variance information such as duration and pitch, Fastspeech 2 and 2s adopt self-attention based\nfeed-forward network to generate mel-spectrograms or waveform in parallel. While some existing\nnon-autoregressive acoustic models (Zeng et al., 2020; Lim et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020) mostly\nfocus on improving the duration accuracy, FastSpeech 2 and 2s provide more variation information\n(duration, pitch and energy) as inputs to reduce the information gap between the input and output. A\nconcurrent work (\u0141a\u00b4ncucki, 2020) employs pitch prediction in phoneme level, while FastSpeech 2\nand 2s predict more \ufb01ne-grained pitch contour in frame level. In addition, to improve the prosody in\nsynthesized speech, FastSpeech 2 and 2s further introduce continuous wavelet transform to model\nthe variations in pitch.\nWhile some text-to-waveform models such as ClariNet (Ping et al., 2019) jointly train an autore-\ngressive acoustic model and a non-autoregressive vocoder, FastSpeech 2s embraces the fully non-\nautoregressive architecture for fast inference. A concurrent work called EATS (Donahue et al., 2020)\n4We do not transform energy using CWT since energy is not as highly variable as pitch on LJSpeech dataset,\nand we do not observe gains when using it.\n5\nalso employs non-autoregressive architecture and adversarial training to convert text to waveform\ndirectly and mainly focuses on predicting the duration of each phoneme end-to-end using a differen-\ntiable monotonic interpolation scheme. Compared with EATS, FastSpeech 2s additionally provides\nmore variation information to ease the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS.\nPrevious non-autoregressive vocoders (Oord et al., 2017; Prenger et al., 2019; Yamamoto et al.,\n2020; Kumar et al., 2019) are not complete text-to-speech systems, since they convert time aligned\nlinguistic features to waveforms, and require a separate linguistic model to convert input text\nto linguistic features or an acoustic model to convert input text to acoustic features (e.g., mel-\nspectrograms). FastSpeech 2s is the \ufb01rst attempt to directly generate waveform from phoneme\nsequence fully in parallel, instead of linguistic features or mel-spectrograms.\n3\nEXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\n3.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nDatasets\nWe evaluate FastSpeech 2 and 2s on LJSpeech dataset (Ito, 2017). LJSpeech contains\n13,100 English audio clips (about 24 hours) and corresponding text transcripts. We split the dataset\ninto three sets: 12,228 samples for training, 349 samples (with document title LJ003) for validation\nand 523 samples (with document title LJ001 and LJ002) for testing. For subjective evaluation, we\nrandomly choose 100 samples in test set. To alleviate the mispronunciation problem, we convert the\ntext sequence into the phoneme sequence (Arik et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018;\nSun et al., 2019) with an open-source grapheme-to-phoneme tool5. We transform the raw waveform\ninto mel-spectrograms following Shen et al. (2018) and set frame size and hop size to 1024 and 256\nwith respect to the sample rate 22050.\nModel Con\ufb01guration\nOur FastSpeech 2 consists of 4 feed-forward Transformer (FFT)\nblocks (Ren et al., 2019) in the encoder and the mel-spectrogram decoder. The output linear layer\nin the decoder converts the hidden states into 80-dimensional mel-spectrograms and our model is\noptimized with mean absolute error (MAE). We add more detailed con\ufb01gurations of FastSpeech 2\nand 2s used in our experiments in Appendix A. The details of training and inference are added in\nAppendix B.\n3.2\nRESULTS\nMethod\nMOS\nGT\n4.30 \u00b1 0.07\nGT (Mel + PWG)\n3.92 \u00b1 0.08\nTacotron 2 (Shen et al., 2018) (Mel + PWG)\n3.70 \u00b1 0.08\nTransformer TTS (Li et al., 2019) (Mel + PWG)\n3.72 \u00b1 0.07\nFastSpeech (Ren et al., 2019) (Mel + PWG)\n3.68 \u00b1 0.09\nFastSpeech 2 (Mel + PWG)\n3.83 \u00b1 0.08\nFastSpeech 2s\n3.71 \u00b1 0.09\n(a) The MOS with 95% con\ufb01dence intervals.\nMethod\nCMOS\nFastSpeech 2\n0.000\nFastSpeech\n-0.885\nTransformer TTS\n-0.235\n(b) CMOS comparison.\nTable 1: Audio quality comparison.\nIn this section, we \ufb01rst evaluate the audio quality, training and inference speedup of FastSpeech 2\nand 2s.

Twenty native English speakers are asked to make quality\n5https://github.com/Kyubyong/g2p\n6We put some audio samples in the supplementary materials and https://speechresearch.\ngithub.io/fastspeech2/.\n6\nMethod\nTraining Time (h)\nInference Speed (RTF)\nInference Speedup\nTransformer TTS (Li et al., 2019)\n38.64\n9.32 \u00d7 10\u22121\n/\nFastSpeech (Ren et al., 2019)\n53.12\n1.92 \u00d7 10\u22122\n48.5\u00d7\nFastSpeech 2\n17.02\n1.95 \u00d7 10\u22122\n47.8\u00d7\nFastSpeech 2s\n92.18\n1.80 \u00d7 10\u22122\n51.8\u00d7\nTable 2: The comparison of training time and inference latency in waveform synthesis. The training\ntime of FastSpeech includes teacher and student training. RTF denotes the real-time factor, that\nis the time (in seconds) required for the system to synthesize one second waveform. The training\nand inference latency tests are conducted on a server with 36 Intel Xeon CPUs, 256GB memory, 1\nNVIDIA V100 GPU and batch size of 48 for training and 1 for inference. Besides, we do not include\nthe time of GPU memory garbage collection and transferring input and output data between the CPU\nand the GPU. The speedup in waveform synthesis for FastSpeech is larger than that reported in Ren\net al. (2019) since we use Parallel WaveGAN as the vocoder which is much faster than WaveGlow.\njudgments about the synthesized speech samples. The text content keeps consistent among different\nsystems so that all testers only examine the audio quality without other interference factors. We\ncompare the MOS of the audio samples generated by FastSpeech 2 and FastSpeech 2s with other\nsystems, including 1) GT, the ground-truth recordings; 2) GT (Mel + PWG), where we \ufb01rst con-\nvert the ground-truth audio into mel-spectrograms, and then convert the mel-spectrograms back to\naudio using Parallel WaveGAN (Yamamoto et al., 2020) (PWG); 3) Tacotron 2 (Shen et al., 2018)\n(Mel + PWG); 4) Transformer TTS (Li et al., 2019) (Mel + PWG); 5) FastSpeech (Ren et al., 2019)\n(Mel + PWG). All the systems in 3), 4) and 5) use Parallel WaveGAN as the vocoder for a fair\ncomparison. The results are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that FastSpeech 2 can surpass and\nFastSpeech 2s can match the voice quality of autoregressive models Transformer TTS and Tacotron\n2. Importantly, FastSpeech 2 outperforms FastSpeech, which demonstrates the effectiveness of pro-\nviding variance information such as pitch, energy and more accurate duration and directly taking\nground-truth speech as training target without using teacher-student distillation pipeline.\nTraining and Inference Speedup\nFastSpeech 2 simpli\ufb01es the training pipeline of FastSpeech by\nremoving the teacher-student distillation process, and thus reduces the training time. We list the\ntotal training time of Transformer TTS (the autoregressive teacher model), FastSpeech (including\nthe training of Transformer TTS teacher model and FastSpeech student model) and FastSpeech 2 in\nTable 2. It can be seen that FastSpeech 2 reduces the total training time by 3.12\u00d7 compared with\nFastSpeech. Note that training time here only includes acoustic model training, without considering\nthe vocoder training. Therefore, we do not compare the training time of FastSpeech 2s here. We then\nevaluate the inference latency of FastSpeech 2 and 2s compared with the autoregressive Transformer\nTTS model, which has the similar number of model parameters with FastSpeech 2 and 2s. We show\nthe inference speedup for waveform generation in Table 2. It can be seen that compared with the\nTransformer TTS model, FastSpeech 2 and 2s speeds up the audio generation by 47.8\u00d7 and 51.8\u00d7\nrespectively in waveform synthesis. We can also see that FastSpeech 2s is faster than FastSpeech 2\ndue to fully end-to-end generation.\n3.2.2\nANALYSES ON VARIANCE INFORMATION\nMethod\n\u03c3\n\u03b3\nK\nDTW\nGT\n54.4\n0.836\n0.977\n/\nTacotron 2\n44.1\n1.28\n1.311\n26.32\nTransformerTTS\n40.8\n0.703\n1.419\n24.40\nFastSpeech\n50.8\n0.724\n-0.041\n24.89\nFastSpeech 2\n54.1\n0.881\n0.996\n24.39\nFastSpeech 2 - CWT\n42.3\n0.771\n1.115\n25.13\nFastSpeech 2s\n53.9\n0.872\n0.998\n24.37\nTable 3: Standard deviation (\u03c3), skewness (\u03b3), kurtosis (K) and average DTW distances (DTW) of\npitch in ground-truth and synthesized audio.\n7\nMore Accurate Variance Information in Synthesized Speech\nIn the paragraph, we measure if\nproviding more variance information (e.g., pitch and energy) as input in FastSpeech 2 and 2s can\nindeed synthesize speech with more accurate pitch and energy.\nFor pitch, we compute the moments (standard deviation (\u03c3), skewness (\u03b3) and kurtosis (K)) (An-\ndreeva et al., 2014; Niebuhr & Skarnitzl, 2019) and average dynamic time warping (DTW) M\u00a8uller\n(2007) distance of the pitch distribution for the ground-truth speech and synthesized speech. The\nresults are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that compared with FastSpeech, the moments (\u03c3, \u03b3\nand K) of generated audio of FastSpeech 2/2s are more close to the ground-truth audio and the av-\nerage DTW distances to the ground-truth pitch are smaller than other methods, demonstrating that\nFastSpeech 2/2s can generate speech with more natural pitch contour (which can result in better\nprosody) than FastSpeech. We also conduct a case study on generated pitch contours in Appendix\nD.\nMethod\nFastSpeech\nFastSpeech 2\nFastSpeech 2s\nMAE\n0.142\n0.131\n0.133\nTable 4: The mean absolute error (MAE) of the energy in synthesized speech audio.\nFor energy, we compute the mean absolute error (MAE) between the frame-wise energy extracted\nfrom the generated waveform and the ground-truth speech. To ensure that the numbers of frames in\nthe synthesized and ground-truth speech are the same, we use the ground-truth duration extracted\nby MFA in both FastSpeech and FastSpeech 2. The results are shown in Table 4. We can see that\nthe MAE of the energy for FastSpeech 2/2s are smaller than that for FastSpeech, indicating that they\nboth synthesize speech audio with more similar energy to the ground-truth audio.\nMore Accurate Duration for Model Training\nWe then analyze the accuracy of the provided\nduration information to train the duration predictor and the effectiveness of more accurate duration\nfor better voice quality based on FastSpeech. We manually align 50 audio generated by the teacher\nmodel and the corresponding text in phoneme level and get the ground-truth phoneme-level duration.\nWe compute the average of absolute phoneme boundary differences (McAuliffe et al., 2017) using\nthe duration from the teacher model of FastSpeech and from MFA as used in this paper respectively.\nThe results are shown in Table 5a. We can see that MFA can generate more accurate duration than\nthe teacher model of FastSpeech. Next, we replace the duration used in FastSpeech (from teacher\nmodel) with that extracted by MFA, and conduct the CMOS (Loizou, 2011) test to compare the voice\nquality between the two FastSpeech models trained with different durations7. The results are listed\nin Table 5b and it can be seen that more accurate duration information improves the voice quality of\nFastSpeech, which veri\ufb01es the effectiveness of our improved duration from MFA.\nMethod\n\u2206(ms)\nDuration from teacher model\n19.68\nDuration from MFA\n12.47\n(a) Alignment accuracy comparison.\nSetting\nCMOS\nFastSpeech + Duration from teacher\n0\nFastSpeech + Duration from MFA\n+0.195\n(b) CMOS comparison.\nTable 5: The comparison of the duration from teacher model and MFA. \u2206means the average of\nabsolute boundary differences.\n3.2.3\nABLATION STUDY\nPitch and Energy Input\nWe conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of several\nvariance information of FastSpeech 2 and 2s, including pitch and energy8. We conduct CMOS eval-\nuation for these ablation studies. The results are shown in Table 6. We \ufb01nd that removing the energy\n(Row 3 in both subtables) in FastSpeech 2 and 2s results in performance drop in terms of voice\nquality (-0.040 and -0.160 CMOS respectively), indicating that energy is effective for FastSpeech 2\nin improving the voice quality, and more effective for FastSpeech 2s. We also \ufb01nd that removing the\n7Both models are trained with mel-spectrograms generated by the teacher model.\n8We do not study duration information since duration is a necessary for FastSpeech and FastSpeech 2.\nBesides, we have already analyzed the effectiveness of our improved duration in the last paragraph.\n8\npitch (Row 4 in both subtables) in FastSpeech 2 and 2s results in -0.245 and -1.130 CMOS respec-\ntively, which demonstrates the effectiveness of pitch. When we remove both pitch and energy (the\nlast row in both subtables), the voice quality further drops, indicating that both pitch and energy can\nhelp improve the performance of FastSpeech 2 and 2s.\nPredicting Pitch in Frequency Domain\nTo study the effectiveness of predicting pitch in fre-\nquency domain using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as described in Section 2.3, we directly\n\ufb01t the pitch contour with mean square error like energy in FastSpeech 2 and 2s. We conduct CMOS\nevaluation and get CMOS drops of 0.185 and 0.201 for FastSpeech 2 and 2s respectively. We also\ncompute the moments of pitch and average DTW distance to the ground-truth pitch as shown in row\n6 (denoeted as FastSpeech 2 - CWT) in Table 3. The results demonstrate that CWT can help model\nthe pitch better and improve the prosody of synthesized speech, and thus obtaining better CMOS\nscore.\nMel-Spectrogram Decoder in FastSpeech 2s\nTo verify the effectiveness of the mel-spectrogram\ndecoder in FastSpeech 2s on text feature extraction as described in Section 2.4, we remove the\nmel-spectrogram decoder and conduct CMOS evaluation. It causes a 0.285 CMOS drop, which\ndemonstrates that the mel-spectrogram decoder is essential to high-quality waveform generation.\nSetting\nCMOS\nFastSpeech 2\n0\nFastSpeech 2 - energy\n-0.040\nFastSpeech 2 - pitch\n-0.245\nFastSpeech 2 - pitch - energy\n-0.370\n(a) CMOS comparison for FastSpeech 2.\nSetting\nCMOS\nFastSpeech 2s\n0\nFastSpeech 2s - energy\n-0.160\nFastSpeech 2s - pitch\n-1.130\nFastSpeech 2s - pitch - energy\n-1.355\n(b) CMOS comparison for FastSpeech 2s.\nTable 6: CMOS comparison in the ablation studies.\n4\nCONCLUSION\nIn this work, we proposed FastSpeech 2, a fast and high-quality end-to-end TTS system, to address\nthe issues in FastSpeech and ease the one-to-many mapping problem: 1) we directly train the model\nwith ground-truth mel-spectrograms to simplify the training pipeline and also avoid information\nloss compared with FastSpeech; and 2) we improve the duration accuracy and introduce more vari-\nance information including pitch and energy to ease the one-to-many mapping problem, and improve\npitch prediction by introducing continuous wavelet transform. Moreover, based on FastSpeech 2, we\nfurther developed FastSpeech 2s, a non-autoregressive text-to-waveform generation model, which\nenjoys the bene\ufb01t of fully end-to-end inference and achieves faster inference speed. Our experi-\nmental results show that FastSpeech 2 and 2s outperform FastSpeech, and FastSpeech 2 can even\nsurpass autoregressive models in terms of voice quality, with much simpler training pipeline while\ninheriting the advantages of fast, robust and controllable speech synthesis of FastSpeech.\nHigh quality, fast and fully end-to-end training without any external libraries is de\ufb01nitely the ulti-\nmate goal of neural TTS and also a very challenging problem. To ensure high quality of FastSpeech\n2, we use an external high-performance alignment tool and pitch extraction tools, which may seem\na little complicated, but are very helpful for high-quality and fast speech synthesis. We believe there\nwill be more simpler solutions to achieve this goal in the future and we will certainly work on fully\nend-to-end TTS without external alignment models and tools. We will also consider more variance\ninformation (Zhang et al., 2021) to further improve the voice quality and speed up the inference with\nmore light-weight model (Luo et al., 2021).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant\nNo.2018AAA0100603), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.62072397), Zhe-\njiang Natural Science Foundation (Grant No.LR19F020006), National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (Grant No.61836002) and X Lab, the Second Academy of CASIC, Beijing, 100854, China.\n9\nLICENSE AND AGREEMENT\nAny organization or individual is prohibited from using any technology mentioned in this paper to\nsynthesize someone\u2019s speech without his/her consent.

In each FFT block, the dimension of phoneme embeddings\nand the hidden size of the self-attention are set to 256. The number of attention heads is set to 2 and\nthe kernel sizes of the 1D-convolution in the 2-layer convolutional network after the self-attention\nlayer are set to 9 and 1, with input/output size of 256/1024 for the \ufb01rst layer and 1024/256 in the\nsecond layer. The size of the phoneme vocabulary is 76, including punctuations. In the variance\npredictor, the kernel sizes of the 1D-convolution are set to 3, with input/output sizes of 256/256 for\nboth layers and the dropout rate is set to 0.5. Our waveform decoder consists of 1-layer transposed\n1D-convolution with \ufb01lter size 64 and 30 dilated residual convolution blocks, whose skip channel\nsize and kernel size of 1D-convolution are set to 64 and 3. The con\ufb01gurations of the discriminator in\nFastSpeech 2s are the same as Parallel WaveGAN (Yamamoto et al., 2020). We list hyperparameters\nand con\ufb01gurations of all models used in our experiments in Table 7.\nHyperparameter\nTransformer TTS\nFastSpeech/FastSpeech 2/2s\nPhoneme Embedding Dimension\n256\n256\nPre-net Layers\n3\n/\nPre-net Hidden\n256\n/\nEncoder Layers\n4\n4\nEncoder Hidden\n256\n256\nEncoder Conv1D Kernel\n9\n9\nEncoder Conv1D Filter Size\n1024\n1024\nEncoder Attention Heads\n2\n2\nMel-Spectrogram Decoder Layers\n4\n4\nMel-Spectrogram Decoder Hidden\n256\n256\nMel-Spectrogram Decoder Conv1D Kernel\n9\n9\nMel-Spectrogram Decoder Conv1D Filter Size\n1024\n1024\nMel-Spectrogram Decoder Attention Headers\n2\n2\nEncoder/Decoder Dropout\n0.1\n0.1\nVariance Predictor Conv1D Kernel\n/\n3\nVariance Predictor Conv1D Filter Size\n/\n256\nVariance Predictor Dropout\n/\n0.5\nWaveform Decoder Convolution Blocks\n/\n30\nWaveform Decoder Dilated Conv1D Kernel size\n/\n3\nWaveform Decoder Transposed Conv1D Filter Size\n/\n64\nWaveform Decoder Skip Channlel Size\n/\n64\nBatch Size\n48\n48/48/12\nTotal Number of Parameters\n24M\n23M/27M/28M\nTable 7: Hyperparameters of Transformer TTS, FastSpeech and FastSpeech 2/2s.\nB\nTRAINING AND INFERENCE\nWe train FastSpeech 2 on 1 NVIDIA V100 GPU, with batchsize of 48 sentences. We use the Adam\noptimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.98, \u03b5 = 10\u22129 and follow the same learning\nrate schedule in Vaswani et al. (2017). It takes 160k steps for training until convergence. In the\ninference process, the output mel-spectrograms of our FastSpeech 2 are transformed into audio\nsamples using pre-trained Parallel WaveGAN (Yamamoto et al., 2020)9. For FastSpeech 2s, we train\nthe model on 2 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, with batchsize of 6 sentences on each GPU. The waveform\ndecoder takes the sliced hidden states corresponding to 20,480 waveform sample clips as input. The\noptimizer and learning rate schedule for FastSpeech 2s are the same as FastSpeech 2. The details of\nthe adversarial training follow Parallel WaveGAN (Yamamoto et al., 2020). It takes 600k steps for\ntraining until convergence for FastSpeech 2s.\n9https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN\n13\nC\nMODELING PITCH WITH CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM\nC.1\nCONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM\nGiven a continous pitch contour function F0, we can convert it to pitch spectrogram W(\u03c4, t) using\ncontinuous wavelet transform (Tuteur, 1988; Grossmann & Morlet, 1984):\nW(\u03c4, t) = \u03c4 \u22121/2\nZ +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nF0(x)\u03c8(x \u2212t\n\u03c4\n)dx\nwhere \u03c8 is the Mexican hat mother wavelet (Ryan, 1994), F0(x) is the pitch value in position x, \u03c4\nand t are scale and position of wavelet respectively. The original pitch contour F0 can be recovered\nfrom the wavelet representation W(\u03c4, t) by inverse continuous wavelet transform (iCWT) using the\nfollowing formula:\nF0(t) =\nZ +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nZ +\u221e\n0\nW (\u03c4, t) \u03c4 \u22125/2\u03c8\n\u0012x \u2212t\n\u03c4\n\u0013\ndxd\u03c4\nSuppose that we decompose the pitch contour F0 into 10 scales (Ming et al., 2016), F0 can be\nrepresented by 10 separate components given by:\nWi(t) = W(2i+1\u03c40, t)(i + 2.5)\u22125/2\n(1)\nwhere i = 1, ..., 10 and \u03c40 = 5ms, which is originally proposed in Suni et al. (2013). Given 10\nwavelet components \u02c6Wi(t), we can recompose pitch contour \u02c6F0 by the following formula (Ming\net al., 2016):\n\u02c6F0(t) =\n10\nX\ni=1\n\u02c6Wi(t)(i + 2.5)\u22125/2\n(2)\nC.2\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nPitch Predictor\nPitch Contour\nPitch Spectrogram,\nMean/Var\niCWT\nCWT\nFigure 2:\nDetails in\npitch predictor.\nCWT\nand iCWT denote con-\ntinuous\nwavelet\ntrans-\nform and inverse contin-\nuous wavelet transform\nrespectively.\nFirst we extract the pitch contour using PyWorldVocoder10. Since CWT\nis very sensitive to discontinuous signals, we preprocess the pitch con-\ntour as follows: 1) we use linear interpolation to \ufb01ll the unvoiced frame\nin pitch contour; 2) we transform the resulting pitch contour to loga-\nrithmic scale; 3) we normalize it to zero mean and unit variance for each\nutterance, and we have to save the original utterance-level mean and vari-\nance for pitch contour reconstruction; and 4) we convert the normalized\npitch contour to pitch spectrogram using continuous wavelet transform\nfollowing Equation 1.\nAs shown in Figure 2, pitch predictor consists of a 2-layer 1D-\nconvolutional network with ReLU activation, each followed by the\nlayer normalization and the dropout layer, and an extra linear layer to\nproject the hidden states into the pitch spectrogram.\nTo predict the\nmean/variance of recovered pitch contour for each utterance, we average\nthe hidden states output by the 1D-convolutional network on the time\ndimension to a global vector and project it to mean and variance using a\nlinear layer.\nWe train the pitch predictor with ground-truth pitch spectrogram and\nthe mean/variance of pitch contour and optimize it with mean square\nerror.\nDuring inference, we predict the pitch spectrogram and the\nmean/variance of recovered pitch contour using pitch predictor, inverse\nthe pitch spectrogram to pitch contour with inverse continuous wavelet\ntransform (iCWT) following Equation 2, and \ufb01nally denormalize it with\nthe predicted mean/variance.\n10https://github.com/JeremyCCHsu/Python-Wrapper-for-World-Vocoder\n14\nD\nCASE STUDY ON PITCH CONTOUR\nIn this section, we conduct the case study on pitch contours of the audios generated by different\nmethods. We randomly choose 1 utterance from the test set and plot the pitch countor of ground-\ntruth audio samples and that generated by FastSpeech, FastSpeech 2, FastSpeech 2s in Figure 3.

The model comprises paral-\nlel branches of polynomial functions followed by linear time-\ninvariant filters. The adversarial optimisation procedure acts to\nminimise the cosine distance between speaker embeddings ex-\ntracted from spoofed and bona fide utterances. Experiments,\nperformed using three recent ASV systems and the ASVspoof\n2019 dataset, show that Malacopula increases vulnerabilities by\na substantial margin. However, speech quality is reduced and\nattacks can be detected effectively under controlled conditions.\nThe findings emphasise the need to identify new vulnerabilities\nand design defences to protect ASV systems from adversarial\nattacks in the wild.\n1. Introduction\nThe performance of automatic speaker verification (ASV) sys-\ntems has improved remarkably in recent years. The pioneer-\ning x-vector approach [1] laid the foundation for more recent\nand robust systems including ECAPA [2], CAM++ [3], and\nERes2Net [4] which consistently outperform their predecessors\nin various benchmarks [5].\nDespite these technological advances, ASV systems remain\nvulnerable to spoofing attacks implemented using, e.g., text-to-\nspeech synthesis and voice conversion techniques. These at-\ntacks have become increasingly sophisticated, capable of pro-\nducing spoofed speech which is generally indistinguishable\nfrom bona fide speech and which effectively compromise ASV\nreliability. Nonetheless, there is evidence that recent ASV sys-\ntems have some natural defensive capabilities against spoofing\nattacks [6]. Natural defences can also be supplemented using\nauxiliary spoofing and deepfake detection solutions [7].\nWhile the study of spoofing and the development of de-\ntection solutions has attracted broad attention, a new threat\nhas emerged in the form of adversarial attacks, e.g. [8].\nThese are implemented using adversarial training which, in\nthe context of ASV, can be used by a fraudster to introduce\nnoise\u2014sometimes imperceptible or easily mistakable for real\nenvironmental sounds\u2014to deceive the classifier and provoke a\nhigher rate of false alarms/acceptances.\nIn recent work [9], we showed how adversarial training\ntechniques can be used to design a simple linear time-invariant\n(LTI) filter, named Malafide, which compromises the reliability\nof even state-of-the-art spoofing and deepfake detection solu-\ntions. In this paper we report our work to evaluate the robust-\nness of ASV systems to the same form of adversarial attacks.\nWe introduce Malacopula,1 a neural-based generalised Ham-\nmerstein model [10] designed specifically to compromise ASV\nsystem reliability through the introduction of adversarial pertur-\nbations to a test speech utterance. Unlike Malafide, Malacopula\nsupports the modification of not only amplitude and phase but\nalso frequency components in non-linear fashion, a crucial ben-\nefit for voice cloning.\nMalacpolua acts as a post-processing filter to increase ASV\nsystem vulnerabilities to spoofing attacks. Tuned to the spoof-\ning attack and speaker identity, the Malacopula filter is opti-\nmised independently of the utterance and input duration, requir-\ning the optimisation of only a small number of filter coefficients,\nin similar fashion to Malafide [9].\n2. Literature Review\nAdversarial attacks were originally introduced for image pro-\ncessing tasks [11], but have since been applied to the speech\ndomain, particularly focusing on automatic speech recogni-\ntion (ASR) [8, 12] and spoofing/automatic speaker verification\n(ASV) systems [13\u201315].\nEarly strategies involved generating adversarial noise spe-\ncific to each utterance, drawing inspiration from image process-\ning techniques [16]. These strategies adapted universal adver-\nsarial perturbations to various audio tasks, including automatic\nspeech and speaker recognition [17\u201319].\nA common theme\namong these methods is the iterative optimisation of adversarial\nperturbations across multiple data samples.\nInitial research [11, 15] primarily explored adversarial ex-\namples as additive noise and their ability to transfer to unseen\nscenarios. The study in [14] explored universal perturbations\nagainst spoofing and deepfake countermeasure (CM) systems.\nThis method targets both CM and ASV subsystems indepen-\ndently of specific attacks. However, it requires the generation of\na different array of adversarial noise for each utterance, which\nresults in a high computational effort. Moreover, the variable\nlength of speech utterances is a constraint upon the generation\nof adversarial noise, rendering these attacks impractical in real-\nworld scenarios.\nMalafide [9] introduced an adversarial technique utilising\nlinear time-invariant (LTI) filters applied in real-time to spoofed\nutterances through time-domain convolution. Unlike traditional\n1Mala copula is Latin for \u201dbad connection\u201d or \u201dbad union.\u201d It signi-\nfies an undesirable or improper association between elements.\narXiv:2408.09300v1  [eess.AS]  17 Aug 2024\nmethods, Malafide filters are optimised independently of the in-\nput utterance and its duration, tailored specifically to the under-\nlying spoofing attack. This method requires the optimisation\nof only a small number of filter coefficients, thereby offering\ngreater flexibility in its application.\nOur approach takes a different path by enhancing specific\nspoofing attacks and targeting specific speakers to increase the\nthreat to ASV systems. We operate under the assumption that\nthe spoofing attack effectively manipulates the ASV subsystem.\nIn contrast to prior research, our method involves the use\nof adversarial, non-linear filters using a generalised Hammer-\nstein model, commonly used for the identification of non-linear\nsystems. Malacopula can be applied in real-time to a spoofed\nutterance via time-domain convolution operations, specifically\ntargeting a particular speaker and the underlying attack algo-\nrithm.\n3. Generalised Hammerstein Model\nThe generalised Hammerstein model is a prominent framework\nin signal processing, employed to identify non-linear dynamic\nsystems. The model combines a static non-linear component\nwith a linear dynamic component, enabling detailed representa-\ntion and manipulation of complex signal characteristics.\nThe structure of the Generalised Hammerstein Model typi-\ncally comprises two main elements: a non-linear transformation\nfollowed by a linear time-invariant (LTI) filter. Mathematically,\nthe model can be expressed as:\ny[n] =\nK\nX\nk=1\nL\u22121\nX\ni=0\nhk[i]\u03d5k(x[n \u2212i])\n(1)\nwhere y[n] is the output signal, x[n] is the input signal,\n\u03d5k(x[n \u2212i]) represents the static non-linear transformation,\nhk[n] represents the impulse response of the LTI filter for the\nk-th branch, L denotes the memory length, K is the number\nof parallel branches and n represents the discrete sample index.\nThe non-linear transformation captures the non-linearities of the\ninput signal, often modelled using polynomials as functions of\nthe input signal: \u03d5k(\u00b7) = (\u00b7)k. The versatility and compu-\ntational efficiency of the generalised Hammerstein model have\nfacilitated its successful application to the modelling of non-\nlinear systems across various fields, including audio processing,\nacoustics, and mechanical vibrations [20\u201323].\nPolynomial Hammerstein models have been employed to\ncharacterise and model non-linear loudspeakers using empiri-\ncally measured Volterra kernels [24]. Results show the potential\nof the approach in estimating reliable non-linear models which\naccurately predict the response to complex real-speech inputs.\nFor the collection of the ASVspoof 2019 physical access (PA)\ndatabases [25], the generalised Hammerstein model was utilised\nto model and simulate loudspeaker artefacts which often stem\nfrom non-linear behaviour. Both linear and non-linear char-\nacteristics accurately simulating the distortions introduced by\nloudspeakers. RawBoost [26] leverages the generalised Ham-\nmerstein model within a machine learning framework primar-\nily for augmentation purposes rather than system identification.\nRawBoost simulates a wide range of signal distortions, thereby\nimproving the robustness and generalisation of machine learn-\ning models trained with augmented data. RawBoost was de-\nveloped specifically for the detection of spoofing and deepfakes\nin the wild but has also been used effectively in other speech-\nrelated applications [27].\n4. Malacopula\nThe generalised Hammerstein model offers a powerful method\nto manipulate multiple characteristics of a speech signal, includ-\ning the modification of amplitude and phase, but also frequency\ncomponents in non-linear fashion. This capability can be ex-\nploited by malicious actors to create adversarial perturbations\nin order to deceive ASV systems. In the following we describe\nthe implementation of the Malacopula filter.\n4.1. Malacopula filter architecture\nThe Malacopula filter structure is shown in Fig. 1. It is com-\nposed of K parallel branches, which represent the non-linear\ndepth, each involving a linear filter c of length L modulated by\na Bartlett window w.2 Each branch processes the input signal\nx by a k-th non-linear, static power polynomial function. The\nfilter operates entirely in the discrete time domain using convo-\nlution operations.\nMathematically, the filter is defined by:\nmcK,L(x) =\nK\nX\nk=1\nh\nxk \u2217(w \u2299ck,L)\ni\n(2)\nwhere \u2217denotes the convolution operator, and \u2299represents the\nHadamard product.\nAdditionally, a normalisation layer using the L\u221enorm is\napplied after the summation operator to produce the output:\nMC(x) =\nmc(x)\n|mc(x)|\u221e\n(3)\n4.2. Adversarial Optimisation Procedure\nThe Malacopula optimisation procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nEach filter is trained independently for a given speaker s, and\na spoof utterance x generated with spoofing algorithm a, and\na bona fide enrolment utterance y. The neural-based gener-\nalised Hammerstein model minimises the following objective\nfunction:\nmin\nc(s,a)\nK,L\nh\n1 \u2212CS\n\u0010\nfA\n\u0010\nMC(s,a)\nK,L (x)\n\u0011\n, fA (y)\n\u0011i\n(4)\nwhere fA(\u00b7) denotes the pre-trained speaker embedding extrac-\ntor, and CS(A, B) =\nA\u00b7B\n\u2225A\u2225\u2225B\u2225is the cosine similarity between\nembeddings A and B. The objective function aims to min-\nimise the cosine distance between the speaker embeddings of\nthe modified input signal MC(x) and the target signal y, en-\nsuring that the adversarial perturbations are effective.\nTo ensure that the adversarial attacks generalise well across\ndifferent speaker embeddings, the best Malacopula filter is se-\nlected using another speaker embedding extractor fB(\u00b7). Filter\nselection is based on the minimum Wasserstein distance3 com-\nputed across all training iterations, and between the following\n2A Bartlett window, also known as a triangular window, is used in\nsignal processing to reduce the side lobes of the filter response, which\nhelps in minimising the spectral leakage. This window is chosen be-\ncause it provides a trade-off between the width of the main lobe and\nthe level of side lobes, making it suitable for applications where both\nfrequency resolution and dynamic range are important.\n3The Wasserstein distance is chosen because it provides a robust\nmeasure of the similarity between two probability distributions by con-\nsidering the \u2019cost\u2019 of transforming one distribution into another. This\nproperty is particularly useful in evaluating the similarity between bona\nfide and spoof scores, as it captures differences in both the shape and\nlocation of the distributions, ensuring that adversarial examples remain\nFigure 1: Malacopula filter architecture based on the generalised Hammerstein model. The blue box represents the linear component,\nwhile the the orange dashed box represents the non-linear filter components.\nFigure 2: During training, Malacopula filters are optimised with the speaker embedding extractor fA(\u00b7) as denoted by Equation 4. To\nensure generalisation across different speakers, the best Malacopula filter is selected using another speaker embedding extractor fB(\u00b7).\nThe selection is based on the minimum Wasserstein distance between the following two score distributions: (i) the cosine distance\nbetween spoofed utterances processed by the Malacopula filter MC(X) and bona fide enrolment utterances y, and (ii) the cosine\ndistance between bona fide target utterances Z and bona fide enrolment utterances y. If multiple enrolment utterances are available, we\nuse the average enrolment embedding.\ntwo score distributions: (i) the cosine distance between em-\nbeddings extracted from spoofed utterances processed by the\nMalacopula MC(X) and those extracted from bona fide en-\nrolment utterances y, and (ii) the cosine distance between em-\nclose to bona fide data. Unlike the Equal Error Rate (EER), which\nonly considers the point where the false acceptance rate equals the false\nrejection rate, the Wasserstein distance evaluates the entire distribu-\ntion, offering a more comprehensive assessment of distribution similar-\nity. The EER may not effectively capture the nuances of distributional\nchanges caused by adversarial perturbations.\nbeddings extracted from bona fide target utterances Z and bona\nfide enrolment utterances y. If multiple enrolment utterances\nare available, we use the average of their embeddings as the fi-\nnal enrolment embedding. Here X and Z are batches of speech\nutterances. This approach hence ensures that adversarial exam-\nples are sufficiently similar to the voice of the original speaker.\nSpecifically, we employ a signed Wasserstein distance to incor-\nporate not only the magnitude but also the direction of the dis-\ntance. A positive Wasserstein distance is considered if the me-\nFigure 3: Pooled spf-EER for baseline spoof and Malacopula filtered spoof attacks for four different ASV systems.\ndian of the distribution of spoof scores exceeds that of the target\nbona fide scores.\n5. Experimental Setup\nWe use three distinct ASV systems, each with unique structural\nand functional characteristics. They are: CAM++ for training;\nECAPA for validation; ERes2Net for testing. By employing\nthree different ASV systems, we are able to test the transfer-\nability of Malacopula attacks across different ASV architectures\nand embedding extraction methodologies. Below, we provide a\nbrief descriptions of each system.\nThe CAM++ [3] system consists of a front-end convolu-\ntion module and a densely connected time delay neural network\n(D-TDNN) backbone and the extraction of a 512-dimensional\nspeaker embedding. Each D-TDNN layer includes a context-\naware masking (CAM) module.\nCAM++ employs multi-\ngranularity pooling to capture discriminative speaker charac-\nteristics, enhancing its ability to differentiate between speakers\neffectively.\nThe ECAPA [2] system uses the TDNN architecture,\nwhich incorporates 3 SE-Res2Block modules to extract a 192-\ndimensional speaker embedding.\nThis structure leverages\nsqueeze-and-excitation (SE) mechanisms to enhance feature\nrepresentation and improve performance in speaker verification\ntasks.\nThe ERes2Net [4] system addresses the limitations of the\ntraditional Res2Net architecture by integrating local and global\nfeature fusion to extract a 192-dimensional speaker embedding.\nThis integration allows ERes2Net to capture both detailed and\nholistic patterns in the input signal, enhancing its capability to\nrecognise speaker-specific characteristics.\n5.1. Database, protocols and filter optimisation\nAll experiments were conducted using the ASVspoof 2019 log-\nical access (LA) dataset [25]. It contains spoofing attacks gen-\nerated with a set of algorithms labelled A01 to A19. Attacks\nA01 to A06 are contained in both the training and development\npartitions, while A07 to A19 are contained only in the evalua-\ntion partition. Training and development partitions relate to the\nrealm of a defender whose role is to train and develop spoofing\nand deepfake detectors. In contrast, the test partition contains\ndata in the realm of the attacker. Speaker and attack-specific\nfilters are hence trained according to (4) using the test partition,\ni.e. using A07 to A19 spoofing attack data. We stress that, in\ncontrast to usual practice, the use of test data for training pur-\nposes is acceptable in this case; the attacker is not bound by\nexperimental protocols and can use test data in any reasonable\nway which is to their advantage.\nMalacopula filters are trained using spoofed and bona\nfide utterances sourced from the test data partition and using\nCAM++ for fA(\u00b7) and ECAPA as fB(\u00b7), while testing is per-\nformed using ERes2Net. The setup reflects a scenario in which\nfilters are trained by an attacker offline and then used to imple-\nment online/real-time attacks, e.g. in a logical access or tele-\nphony scenario.\n5.2. Implementation\nThe objective function (4) is optimised with Adam [28]. Filters\nare optimised for 60 epochs with a batch size of 12. ASV model\nweights are kept frozen during optimisation. We used two filter\nlengths L \u2208{257, 1025} and three filter depths K \u2208{1, 3, 5}\nto explore the balance between optimisation of (4), attack suc-\ncess and the preservation of speech quality. Our specific im-\nplementation, along with audio examples, is available as open-\nsource and can be used to reproduce our results under the same\nGPU environment.4\n5.3. Metrics\nAll results are obtained using the standard SASV evaluation\nprotocol [29] and are expressed in terms of spf-EERs computed\nusing target (positive class) and spoofed (negative class) utter-\nances.\n6. Experimental Results\nResults presented in Fig. 3 show pooled spf-EERs for the three\nASV systems, comparing baseline spoof results with those us-\ning Malacopula filters of different length and depth. For com-\nparison with a legacy ASV system, we include performance for\nan x-vector system among the baseline spoof results to show\nthat modern systems are less vulnerable. For Malacopula at-\ntacks, the vulnerability increases universally, and more signifi-\ncantly for CAM++ which is used for training. Still, spf-EERs\nare higher for ECAPA and ERes2Net systems than for the base-\nline condition. This shows that Malacopula filters exhibit some\ngeneralisation across different ASV architectures.\nFig. 4 show a performance comparison for baseline spoof\nand Malacopula 257-5 filters for the three systems \u2014 CAM++,\nECAPA, and ERes2Net \u2014 for all thirteen underlying spoof at-\n4https://github.com/eurecom-asp/malacopula\nFigure 4: spf-EER per attacks for baseline spoof and Malacopula 257-5 filtered spoof attacks of three ASV systems.\nFigure 5: spf-EER per attacks for baseline spoof and Malacopula 257-5 filtered spoof attacks of three ASV systems.\nFigure 6: MOS distributions for baseline spoof and Malacopula\nfiltered spoof.\ntacks. For certain attacks, such as A09, Malacopula leads to\na significant increase in the vulnerability of all three systems.\nHowever, Malacopula exhibits lower performance against cer-\ntain already-effective attacks, such as A12. For attacks A17,\nA18, and A19, which are all voice conversion based attacks, a\nsimilar increase in vulnerability is observed.\nOverall, results show that Malacopula filters provoke in-\ncreased vulnerabilities across the three ASV systems and attack\nscenarios. This underscores the importance of continuous im-\nprovement and adaptation in ASV system defences to maintain\nrobustness against evolving adversarial techniques.\nFig. 5 shows the impact of Malacopula 257-5 filters upon\nthe popular ASSIST [30] spoof and deepfake detection system.\nResults are shown in terms of spf-EERs for baseline spoof (blue\nbars) and Malacopula attacks (red bars). When the utterances\nare processed by Malacopula, AASIST performance improves\nalmost universally. Only for A13 and A14 are spf-EERs higher,\nalbeit only very marginally, and are in any case still low. These\nresults indicate that Malacopula attacks are easily detectable,\nreinforcing the need for dedicated detection solutions in order\nto protect ASV systems from manipulation.\nFig. 6 illustrates the impact on speech quality measured in\nterms of the mean opinion score (MOS) for various Malacop-\nula configurations. All scores were estimated automatically us-\ning the method described in [31]. MOS distributions are shown\nfor the baseline spoof and Malacopula attacks (L, K). As ex-\npected, distributions for the baseline spoof attacks are generally\nhigher, with distribution modes of around 3 and 4, For Malacop-\nula attacks, distribution modes are between 1 and 2. Variations\nin speech quality caused by Malacopula attacks are attributed to\nthe use of more or less aggressive filters, where smaller values\nof L and K cause less degradation.\nHowever, the controlled conditions under which ASVspoof\n2019 source data was initially collected, do not reflect factors\nsuch as background or channel noise, which typify conditions\nin the wild and which may influence results. Perturbations in-\ntroduced by Malacopula themselves resemble background or\nchannel noise. This suggests the need for further investigations\nto verify detection performance in more realistic acoustic con-\nditions and scenarios.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we introduce Malacopula, an adversarial perturba-\ntion model in the form of generalised Hammerstein framework,\nwhich acts upon a speech utterance in order to exaggerate and\nexploit the vulnerabilities of automatic speaker verification sys-\ntems to spoofing and deepfake attacks. Malacopula extends the\ncapabilities of previous models, enabling more effective manip-\nulation of the amplitude, phase, and frequency components of\nspeech signals in non-linear fashion.\nExperiments, performed using the ASVspoof 2019 dataset\nshow that Malacopula significantly increases the vulnerability\nof CAM++, ECAPA, and ERes2Net ASV systems to spoofing\nand deepfake attacks. The cross-system training and evalua-\ntion nature of the experiments underscores the robustness and\ntransferability of Malacopula attacks, highlighting the potential\nthreat in real-world scenarios.\nDespite the power of Malacopula in increasing the threat of\nspoofing attacks, our analysis reveals that the resulting perturba-\ntions reduce speech quality, as reflected by lower mean opinion\nscores. Reassuringly, though, spoofing and deepfake detection\nsystems like AASIST are capable of detecting Malacopula at-\ntacks. However, we acknowledge that our current work shows\nonly that attacks are detected effectively under controlled condi-\ntions. This suggests the need for further investigations to deter-\nmine whether the same defences remain robust in unconstrained\nscenarios. Our findings highlight the importance of continuing\nthe hunt for new vulnerabilities and efforts to tackle them so as\nto ensure the reliability of ASV systems in the wild.\n8.

    "2407.18517": "SLIM: Style-Linguistics Mismatch Model for\nGeneralized Audio Deepfake Detection\nYi Zhu\nSurya Koppisetti\nTrang Tran\nGaurav Bharaj\nReality Defender\n{yi,surya,trang,gaurav}@realitydefender.ai\nAbstract\nAudio deepfake detection (ADD) is crucial to combat the misuse of speech syn-\nthesized from generative AI models. Existing ADD models suffer from gener-\nalization issues, with a large performance discrepancy between in-domain and\nout-of-domain data. Moreover, the black-box nature of existing models limits their\nuse in real-world scenarios, where explanations are required for model decisions.\nTo alleviate these issues, we introduce a new ADD model that explicitly uses the\nStyle-LInguistics Mismatch (SLIM) in fake speech to separate them from real\nspeech. SLIM first employs self-supervised pretraining on only real samples to\nlearn the style-linguistics dependency in the real class. The learned features are\nthen used in complement with standard pretrained acoustic features (e.g., Wav2vec)\nto learn a classifier on the real and fake classes. When the feature encoders are\nfrozen, SLIM outperforms benchmark methods on out-of-domain datasets while\nachieving competitive results on in-domain data. The features learned by SLIM\nallow us to quantify the (mis)match between style and linguistic content in a sample,\nhence facilitating an explanation of the model decision.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe growing interest in generative models has led to an expansion of publicly available tools that can\nclosely mimic the voice of a real person [69]. Text-to-speech (TTS) or voice conversion (VC) systems\ncan now be used to synthesize a fake voice from only a few seconds of real speech recordings [68].\nWhen these generation tools are used by bad actors, their outputs, commonly referred to as \u2018audio\ndeepfakes\u2019 [28], can pose serious dangers. Examples include impersonation of celebrities/family\nmembers for robocalls [29], illegal access to voice-guarded bank accounts [14], or forgery of evidence\nin court [53]. Reliable audio deepfake detection (ADD) tools are therefore urgently needed.\nState-of-the-art (SOTA) detection systems [75, 86] employ self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders\nas the frontend feature extractors, and append classification backends to map the high-dimensional\nfeature representations to a binary real/fake decision [35, 86, 75]. Common SSL encoders for this task\nare the Wav2vec [7], WavLM [11], and HuBert [24], among others. These models are usually trained\nin a fully-supervised manner, with fake samples generated using off-the-shelf TTS/VC tools [34, 86,\n12, 75, 49, 85, 27]. However, current ADD systems are known to underperform on deepfakes crafted\nby unseen generative models (i.e., unseen attacks) [40, 48, 63, 86]. To tackle this issue, some works\nhave focused on extracting more robust features from the input representation [25, 67, 85]. Additional\nimprovements have been reported by finetuning the SSL frontend during downstream supervised\ntraining [67, 75, 44] and by increasing the diversity of labelled samples via data augmentation or\ncontinual training on vocoded data [66, 80, 76, 77]. While shown to be effective for in-domain\ndeepfakes, frontend finetuning increases the cost of training drastically.\nAdditionally, outputs from existing ADD systems are hard to explain, i.e., it is unclear to a typical\nuser why an ADD makes a certain prediction, which leads to lack of trust [86, 34]. For practical\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2407.18517v1  [cs.SD]  26 Jul 2024\napplications, it is crucial to understand what information the model is relying on to make decisions,\nand under which circumstances the model would fail to successfully detect deepfakes. A group\nof works uses explainable AI (xAI) methods [4] to interpret model decisions [21, 32, 36], but they\nmainly rely on post-hoc visualizations such as saliency maps, which are known to be sensitive\nto training set-ups [83] and can therefore be inconsistent. Other models focus on specific vocal\nattributes, such as breath [33], or vocal tract [10] to derive explanations. However, most of these\ninterpretable attributes only account for a subset of deepfake-related characteristics, hence resulting\nin a large gap in detection performance compared to SOTA methods [86, 34]. We note that while\n\u201cinterpretability/explainability\u201d is often ambiguous [39], in this work we mean the model\u2019s ability to\nprovide reasons for a certain prediction, e.g., a sample is likely fake because its style and linguistics\nrepresentations are more misaligned than those of real samples (as will be shown in Section 4.2).\nIn this study, we propose a generalizable ADD model that explicitly explores the style-linguistics\nmismatch in deepfakes to separate them from real ones, and thereby facilitates an explanation on\nthe model decision. We hypothesize that in real speech, a certain dependency exists between the\nlinguistics information embedded in the verbal content and the style information embedded in the\nvocal attributes, such as speaker identity and emotion. To synthesize a deepfake audio, both TTS and\nVC systems artificially combine the verbal content with the vocal attributes of a target speaker, and\nthereby introduce an artificial style-linguistics dependency that would differ from the real speech.\nOur two-stage framework explicitly studies the Style-LInguistics Mismatch (SLIM) in the fake class\nto separate it from the real class. During Stage 1, the style-linguistics dependency in the real class\nis learned by contrasting the style and linguistic subspace representations and generating a set of\ndependency features from each subspace. The learned pairs of style and linguistics features are\nexpected to be more correlated for real speech than for deepfake speech. In Stage 2, we employ\nsupervised training, wherein we fuse the learned dependency features from Stage 1 with the original\nstyle and linguistic representations and train a light-weight projection head to classify the input\nrepresentations as real or fake.\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows:\n1. We propose SLIM, a model leveraging Style and LInguistics Mismatch in deepfake audios for\ngeneralized detection with interpretation capabilities.\n2. SLIM outperforms existing SOTA methods on out-of-domain datasets (In-the-wild, MLAAD)\nwhile being competitive on in-domain datasets (ASVspoof2019, 2021). This is achieved without\nincreasing the amount of labeled data or the added cost from end-to-end finetuning.\n3. Unlike black-box ADD models, the style-linguistics features learned by SLIM can be used to\ninterpret model decisions. We present analyses to show how the interpretation can be performed\non a group level as well as on individual speech samples.\n2\nRelated works\n2.1\nAudio deepfake detection\nState-of-the-art ADD systems mainly rely on fully-supervised training, where the model architectures\ncomprise of one or more speech SSL frontends and a backend classifier [86, 2, 45]. Guo et al. [23]\ndeveloped a multi-fusion attentive classifier to process the output from a WavLM frontend; Yang\net al. [85] fused outputs from multiple SSL frontends and reported improvements over using a single\nfrontend. However, existing ADD systems experience severe degradation in performance when tested\non unseen data [48, 63], which questions their applicability and trustworthiness for real-world scenar-\nios. To address this issue, multiple works have explored methods to improve model generalizability.\nWith added training cost, improvements have been reported when frontends are finetuned alongside\nthe backend classifiers during downstream training [67, 75]. Further improvements were achieved\nwith data augmentations such as RawBoost [66, 67] and neural vocoding [76]. More recent works\nalso show that distilled student models can generalize better than large teacher models [43, 77]. Still,\nlarge discrepancies between in-domain and out-of-domain performance are common [86, 34].\nIn addition to generalization, existing ADD models also fall short on interpretability. Several studies\nhave shown that current SOTA models may be focusing on artifacts introduced in the frequency\nspectrum during voice synthesis and/or the artifacts in non-speech segments [63, 47, 40, 88]. While\na line of work proposed to extract speech-related features, such as breath [33] and vocal tract and\n2\narticulatory movement [10], the overall detection performance was inferior to SSL-based methods.\nOther works resort to xAI methods [4] for model interpretation, such as SHAP [21], GradCAM [32],\nand Deep Taylor [36]. However, these post-hoc analysis approaches are known to be sensitive to\ntraining set-ups [83] and therefore not viable for practical use. Both generalization and interpretability\nremain challenging issues for current ADD systems.\n2.2\nStyle-linguistics modelling\nOne standard approach for modelling speech is to decompose it into two subspaces, style and\nlinguistics. The former refers to short and long-term paralinguistic attributes, such as speaker\nidentity, emotion, accent, and health state [61]. The latter corresponds to the verbal content of\nspeech [31]. For representing style information, early works relied on handcrafted features, such as\nGeMAPS [19, 18]. Later studies showed improved performance by representations learned end-to-\nend by deep neural networks (DNN), such as the x-vector [64] and ECAPA-TDNN embeddings [16].\nSimilarly, the linguistic representations follow a similar trend where DNN-based embeddings, such\nas Whisper [57], outperform handcrafted features for content-related tasks [17]. More recent studies\nhave shown that style and linguistics information can be efficiently encoded together in the SSL\nrepresentations [7, 11, 24]. To investigate how speech information is encoded in DNNs, a group of\nworks conducted layer-wise analysis and showed that early to middle layers carry more style related\nattributes, such as speaker identity [5], emotion [60], and articulatory movement [13]; while later\nlayers encode linguistics attributes, such as phonetic information and semantics [52, 62].\nDespite these approaches, it is unclear if completely disentangling style and linguistics information in\nspeech is possible. Studies have shown that a certain dependency exists between these two subspaces:\nthe link between emotional states and word choices [38], the relation between prosody and language\nunderstanding [15], and the impact of age on sentence coherence [55]. Effectively modeling both the\nindependent and dependent aspects of style and linguistics in speech still remains a challenge.\n3\nMethod\n3.1\nMotivation\nFor the majority of generative speech models, the style and linguistic subspaces are assumed to be\nindependent of each other [69, 26, 73, 46]. For example, VC systems change the voice of an utterance\nby replacing the source speaker\u2019s embeddings with those of the target speaker [46, 73], assuming\nthat these embeddings contain no linguistics information. Similarly, modern TTS systems rely on\nindependently learned representations to model different speech aspects (e.g., text, speaker, emotion)\nto synthesize expressive speech [8, 16, 72].\nBecause of this disentanglement assumption, a mismatch likely exists between the style and linguistics\ninformation in TTS/VC speech that differentiates it from real speech. To study this hypothesis,\nwe conduct a proof-of-concept experiment on a sample subset of ASVSpoof2019 [71]. Following\nprevious research [58, 30, 51], we use canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to derive a subspace where\nthe linear projections of the style and linguistics embeddings are maximally correlated for the real\nclass. We choose the last layer output of pretrained wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-english [22] for\nlinguistics representation, and the pretrained ECAPA-TDNN embeddings [16] for style representation.\nTable 1: Mean and standard deviation of Pearson correlation coefficients (r) calculated between\nstyle and linguistics embeddings for real and TTS/VC samples across 5 unseen speakers. Significant\ndifference (calculated by Welch\u2019s t-test) is seen between real speech and all types of generated speech.\nClass\nReal\nA01 (TTS) A02 (TTS)\nA03 (TTS)\nA04 (TTS)\nA05 (VC)\nA06 (VC)\nr\n.308\u00b1.025\n.202\u00b1.033\n.217\u00b1.020\n.243\u00b1.024\n.253\u00b1.021\n.214\u00b1.026\n.252\u00b1.020\nWe randomly select 100 real speech samples from ASVspoof2019 [71] training set to fit 20-dim\nCCA features for both linguistics and style representations. We then apply the CCA projection to 200\naudios from 5 unseen speakers and 6 TTS/VC systems, and compute the correlation values between\nthese projected style and linguistics vectors to quantify the subpace similarities.\n3\nTable. 1 shows these results. A higher r is seen for the real samples, whereas significantly lower\ncorrelations are observed for both TTS and VC generated samples. Moreover, TTS-samples on\naverage show lower r (0.228) than VC-samples (0.236), indicating that VC-samples are closer to real\nspeech in terms of style-linguistics dependency. This could explain why VC samples were found to\nbe more challenging to detect than TTS samples in the ASVspoof2019 challenge [40]. While our\nfindings demonstrate the usefulness of CCA for validating the subspace mismatch, its limitations,\nsuch as that it only explores the linear composites of the variables [79], might make it sub-optimal\nto be used independently for deepfake detection. We therefore develop a detection framework that\nexplicitly studies the style-linguistic mismatch and scales to larger amount of data.\n3.2\nFormulation of SLIM\nOur two-stage Style-LInguistics Mismatch (SLIM) learning framework is outlined in Fig. 1. The first\nstage operates on the real class only and employs self-supervised learning to build style and linguistic\nrepresentations and their dependencies for real speech. In the second stage, a classifier is fit onto the\nlearned representations via supervised training over deepfake datasets with binary (real/fake) labels.\nFigure 1: SLIM: A two-stage training framework for ADD. Stage 1 extracts style and linguistics\nrepresentations from frozen SSL encoders, compresses them, and aims to minimize the distance\nbetween the compressed representations (Lcross), as well as the intra-subspace redundancy (Lstyle\nand Llinguistics). The Stage 1 features and the original subspace representations (pretrained SSL\nembeddings) are combined in Stage 2 to learn a classifier via supervised training.\n3.2.1\nStage 1: One-class self-supervised contrastive training\nThe goal of the first stage is to learn pairs of dependency features from style and linguistics subspaces,\nwhich are expected to be highly correlated for real samples and minimally correlated for deepfakes.\nSince only real samples are needed, we incorporate other open-source speech datasets to diversify\nthe style variations. Given a speech sample, we first extract the style and linguistics representations\nseparately using pretrained networks. Since recent SSL models achieve superior performance on\nmultiple speech downstream tasks compared to conventional speech representations (e.g., ECAPA-\nTDNN) [7, 11, 24, 84, 54] we select a group of SSL models finetuned for paralinguistics and\nlinguistics tasks as candidate encoders [20, 74, 54, 78, 6]. In addition, it has been shown that\nearly to middle model layers carry paralinguistics information, while later layers encode linguistics\ncontent [51, 5, 37, 62]; we conducted thorough analyses to examine the cross-correlation between\npretrained SSL model layers (Appendix A.1) and chose layer 0-10\u2019s output from Wav2vec-XLSR fine-\ntuned for speech emotion recognition to represent style, and layer 14-21\u2019s output from Wav2vec-XLSR\nfinetuned for automatic speech recognition, to represent linguistics information.\n4\nBoth style (XS) and linguistics (XL) embeddings are three-dimensional tensors \u2208RK\u00d7F \u00d7T where\nK denotes the transformer layer index, F denotes the feature size, and T denotes the number of\ntime steps. These subspace embeddings are sent into compression modules C(\u00b7), which average the\ntransformer layer outputs and reduce the feature size from 1024 to 256 (see also Appendix A.3). We\nrefer to the output from the compression modules as dependency features: Sf,t = C(XS) for style\nand Lf,t = C(XL) for linguistics, and their temporally averaged versions are denoted \u00afSf and \u00afLf.\nThese dependency features are learned by minimizing the self-contrastive loss Lcon, defined as:\nLcon = Lcross + \u03bbLintra,\nLintra = Lstyle + Llinguistics\n(1)\nLcross = 1\nT\nT\nX\nt=0\n\u2225Sf,t \u2212Lf,t\u22252\nF,\nLintra = \u2225\u00afSf \u00afS\u22ba\nf \u2212I\u22252\nF + \u2225\u00afLf \u00afL\u22ba\nf \u2212I\u22252\nF\n(2)\nLcross denotes the cross-subspace loss; Lintra is the intra-subspace loss, defined in terms of Lstyle\nand Llinguistics (Figure 1); \u03bb \u2208[0, 1] is a hyperparameter that weighs the two loss terms, T is the\nnumber of time steps; and \u2225(.)\u22252\nF is the Frobenius norm. The Lcross term reduces distance between\nthe compressed style and linguistic embeddings, while the Lintra term reduces redundancy within\nthe (temporally averaged) style and linguistic features by pushing off-diagonal elements to zero.\nThe learned dependency features from Stage 1 can be used to quantify whether a mismatch exists\nbetween the style and linguistics of an audio. We further demonstrate this in Section 4.2.\n3.2.2\nStage 2: Supervised training\nThe second stage of SLIM follows a standard supervised training scheme, where the dependency\nfeatures and subspace representations are concatenated and fed into a classification head to generate\na binary real/fake outcome. As shown in Figure 1, the subspace SSL encoders and compression\nmodules are obtained from Stage 1 and are all frozen during Stage 2. Since the dependency features\nare specifically designed to capture the style-linguistics mismatch alone, we complement them with\nthe original embeddings in order to capture other artifacts that can help separate real samples from\nthe fake class. The original embedding\u2019s dimensions are reduced from 1024 to 256 through an\nattentive statistics pooling (ASP) layer and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. The projected\nsubspace embeddings when concatenated with dependency features result in 1024-dim vectors. The\nclassification head consists of two fully-connected layers and a dropout layer. Binary cross-entropy\nloss is used to jointly train the ASP and MLP modules alongside the classification head.\n4\nExperiments\nBased on the preliminary results from Section 3.1, we systematically assess the in-domain and\ncross-domain detection performance of SLIM using multiple datasets, and demonstrate how such\nframework would benefit the interpretation of model decisions.\n4.1\nExperimental set-up\nStage 1 training.\nUnlike benchmark models which are trained end-to-end in a supervised manner,\nour model relies on two-stage training where each stage requires different training data to avoid\ninformation leakage. Since only real samples are needed in Stage 1, we take advantage of open-source\nspeech datasets by aggregating subsets from the Common Voice [3] and RAVDESS [41] as training\ndata and use a small portion of real samples from the ASVspoof2019 LA train for validation. Both\nCommon Voice and RAVDESS cover a variety of speaker traits. The former is a crowdsourced dataset\ncollected online from numerous speakers with uncontrolled acoustic environments, while the latter is\nan emotional speech corpus with large variations in prosodic patterns. Such data variety enables our\nmodel to learn a wider range of style-linguistics combinations.\nStage 2 training and evaluation.\nFor a fair comparison with existing works, we adopt the standard\ntrain-test partition, where only the ASVspoof2019 logical access (LA) training and development\nsets are used for training and validation. For evaluation, we use the test split from ASVspoof2019\nLA [71] and ASVspoof2021 DF[40]. ASVspoof2019 LA and ASVspoof2021 DF have been used as\n5\nstandard datasets for evaluating deepfake detection models, where real speech recordings originate\nfrom the VCTK and VCC datasets [82, 42, 87] and the spoofed ones are generated with a variety of\nTTS and VC systems. Compared to ASVspoof2019 LA, ASVspoof2021 DF contains more than 100\ndifferent types of generated speech in the evaluation set, providing a more stringent setting for testing\ngeneralization to unseen attacks. In addition, we assess our model\u2019s generalizability on out-of-domain\ndata: In-the-wild [48], and the English subset from MLAAD v3 [50]. In-the-wild consists of on\naudio clips collected from English-speaking celebrities and politicians, featuring more realistic and\nspontaneous speech samples. The English subset of MLAAD (hereinafter referred to as MLAAD-EN)\nis a recent dataset with spoofed samples generated using state-of-the-art open-source TTS and VC\nsystems (more details in Appendix A.2).\nMetrics.\nEqual error rate (EER) is a standard metric for evaluating deepfake detection systems [71,\n40]. It refers to the point in the detection error tradeoff curve where the false acceptance rate equals\nthe false rejection rate. Lower EER suggests better performance. We also report F1-beta scores (\u03b2=1)\nto account for the class imbalance. Higher F1 scores suggest better performance.\nBenchmarks.\nWe consider several SOTA models to benchmark against and broadly categorize\nthem as follows, based on the training cost: (i) methods which freeze feature extraction frontends\nand finetune only the backend classifiers, and (ii) methods which finetune frontends together with\nthe classifiers during supervised training. As benchmarks representing the former case, we consider\nWav2vec-XLSR+LLGF (W2V-LLGF) [80], Wav2vec-XLSR+LCNN (W2V-LCNN) [80], six dif-\nferent models that share a similar backend classifier as SLIM (W2V/WLM/HUB-ASP), a model\nthat fuses different SSL representations (SSL-fusion) [85], as well as three methods that do not rely\non large SSL encoders, namely, LCNN [12], RawNet2 [65], and PS3DT [81]. For the end-to-end\nfine-tuning benchmarks, we consider the model in [44] with a backend classifier similar to SLIM\u2019s\n(W2V-ASP-ft), and the model in [66] with RawBoost augmentation and AASIST backend (W2V-\nAASIST). Using frozen frontends, five variants of SLIM are considered, where the input at Stage 2\nis: (i) only the style embedding, (ii) only the linguistics embedding, (iii) the combination of style\nand linguistics embeddings, (iv) only the style-linguistics dependency features, and (v) the fusion\nof style and linguistic embeddings and their dependency features. We emphasize that the original\nSLIM framework does not involve any finetuning of frontends, since the finetuning may change the\ndisentanglement of style and linguistics embeddings and thus hamper model explainability. However,\nto compare with finetuned benchmarks, we include a variant of SLIM that finetunes all modules\nduring Stage 2, noting that this would compromise the feature interpretation.\nImplementation details.\nWe implement our models using the SpeechBrain toolkit [59] v1.0.0.\nThe hyperparameters used for Stage 1 and Stage 2 training are provided in Appendix A.6. When\nsetting up our customized benchmark models, we followed consistent training recipes where only the\nmodel architectures were changed and the same data augmentation method was used. Each round of\nevaluation was repeated three times with different random seeds, and the mean values are reported.\n4.2\nExperiment results\nDetection performance.\nTable 2 summarizes the detection performance of all models and compares\nthe number of trainable parameters. We discuss the models with frozen frontend here, and compare\nthe models with finetuned frontend in Section. 4.3. ASVspoof2019 eval set contains 19 types\nof attacks, out of which 6 are seen during training. This makes it the simplest of the four test\ndatasets. We see that a majority of the models achieve near-perfect performance, with several\nincluding SLIM reporting EER below 1%. As expected, degradation is seen when models are tested\non ASVspoof2021, where the majority of attacks are unseen. Both W2V-LCNN and SLIM are\ntop-performers, with no significant difference between the two. With the out-of-domain datasets\n(In-the-wild and MLAAD-EN), more severe degradation is observed, where the majority report EERs\nover 20%. SLIM, however, outperforms the others with EER of 12.9% and 13.5% on In-the-wild\nand MLAAD-EN, respectively. It should be noted that although ASVspoof2021 is often used as a\nstandard dataset to evaluate model generalizability to unseen attacks [40], part of the real samples in\nASVspoof2021 originate from the same dataset (the VCTK corpus [82]) as the ASVspoof2019 training\ndata [71, 12, 65, 80, 75]. As a result, the real samples from ASVspoof2019 and ASVspoof2021\nshare a similar distribution, whereas the In-the-wild and MLAAD-EN samples share nearly no\noverlap with ASVspoof (further discussion in Appendix A.2). Generalization to In-the-wild and\n6\nMLAAD-EN is therefore more challenging than to ASVspoof2021. The large gains reported by SLIM\ndemonstrates how the style-linguistics mismatch helps with generalization to unseen data.\nIn Table 2, we also demonstrate the benefits of introducing Stage 1 by considering features from\nSLIM variants as inputs to Stage 2: dependency features, the style and linguistics embeddings (Encsty\nand Encling), as well as their combination. The architecture of the classification head is kept the same,\nexcept for the number of neurons in the input layer. The dependency features outperform the rest on\nthe two out-of-domain datasets, while the subspace embeddings perform better on ASVspoof2021.\nSimply concatenating the style and linguistics embeddings does not yield significant improvements\nwhen compared to benchmark models. This suggests that the style-linguistics dependency may not\nbe fully captured by supervised training methods without explicit guidance.\nTable 2: Detection performance on different deepfake datasets. Experiments were repeated three\ntimes with different random seeds, and average metric values are reported. #Param refers to the\nnumber of trainable parameters (in millions). For SLIM, we sum up parameters trained at both stages.\nA few models do not make their code open-source, we therefore include the metrics reported in their\npapers and skip parameter calculation (N/A).

Since the distance values approximately follow a Gaussian distribution\nwith unequal variances, we further conduct a Welch\u2019s t-test [1] to examine the statistical significance\nof the difference between real and fake samples. For all three datasets, the average cosine distance is\nfound to be significantly lower for real speech than for deepfake samples (p < 1e\u22125). This further\ncorroborates our hypothesis that a higher style-linguistics mismatch exists for fakes. On the other\nhand, the distance distributions of real and fake samples still share a large overlap, indicating that\ndependency features alone are not sufficient for perfectly discriminating between the two classes.\nAnalysis of style-linguistics dependency features.\nTable 2 demonstrates that style-linguistics\ndependency features can provide better generalizability than the subspace embeddings (Table 2 SLIM\nvariants, rows 1\u20134). To examine these results, we first aggregate ASVspoof2021, In-the-wild, and\nMLAAD-EN, and project the dependency features as well as the concatenated subspace embeddings to a\n7\nFigure 2: Cosine distance (log scale) calculated between the style and linguistics dependency features\nfor ASVspoof2021 DF eval, In-the-wild, and MLAAD-EN. Whiskers from top to bottom represent\nthe 75% quartile, median, and 25% quartile of the distribution.\n2-dim space using t-SNE for visualization (Figure 3). Since we use frozen frontends, the embeddings\ninput to Stage 2 training are not affected by backpropagation. Ideal embeddings would exhibit\nmaximal separation between the real and fake classes, while showing minimal shift within each\nclass for different dataset distributions. In Figure 3, we see that the dependency features show larger\ndiscrimination between real and fakes (3(c) and 3(d)) than the concatenated subspace embeddings\n(3(a) and 3(b)), and also a smaller shift between datasets: fake and real samples from the same dataset\n(color) clusters have less overlap in distribution in the plots.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 3: Projected embeddings using t-SNE for style-linguistic representations: (a) subspace\nembeddings - real class, (b) subspace embeddings - fake class, (c) dependency features - real class,\n(d) dependency features - fake class. Data distributions are visualized on the upper and right side of\nthe embedding plots. Red: ASVspoof2021; Green: In-the-wild; Blue: MLAAD-EN.\nInterpretation of model decisions.\nNext, we perform a qualitative evaluation of the model deci-\nsions. Figure 4 shows the mel-spectrograms of four samples selected from In-the-wild.1 These\nfour demonstrate typical acoustic characteristics that represent a larger group of recordings: (1)\ntop-left is a fake sample with audible artifacts at high-frequency region; (2) top-right is a fake sample\nwith unnaturally long pauses heard before and after the phrase \u201cbut not\u201d; (3) bottom left is a real\nsample with an atypical speech style where the word pronunciations are elongated; (4) bottom right\nis a real speech recorded in a noisy condition. We find that among the top-performing systems shown\nin Table 2, only SLIM classified all four samples correctly (both frozen and fine-tuned versions; with\nall features), while others mostly failed on (2) and (4). Findings here suggest that SLIM provides\nguidance when abnormalities in style and linguistics occur. Such guidance can be complemented via\npost-hoc analysis tools such as human evaluations or saliency maps [4] for further interpretation.\nAdditionally, we note that the decisions made by dependency features and the original subspace\nrepresentations are complementary to each other. Samples in the right column are correctly identified\nas fake by the dependency features but missed by the original subspace representations, and vice\nversa (left column missed by dependency features). These results corroborate with the nature of the\ntwo feature types. The dependency features are learned by modelling the general style-linguistics\n1These recordings are available in the supplementary documents.\n8\nrelationship seen in real speech, therefore samples with mismatched style-linguistics pattern are\nlikely to be flagged as \u201cunreal.\u201d The original style and linguistics embeddings, on the other hand,\nare sensitive to signal artifacts, which could be the deepfake imperfections generated during speech\nsynthesis [63], or the amount of background noise and device artifacts. By combining the two\nfeatures, SLIM captures a variety of abnormalities and achieves improved classification.\nFigure 4: Mel-spectrograms of select samples from In-the-wild. SLIM classifies all four correctly,\nand when reporting fakes, provides guidance on abnormalities in style and/or linguistics. Also, the\ndependency and subspace features in SLIM are complementary to each other. Left: samples missed\nby dependency features but correctly identified by the style and linguistic features; right: vice versa.\n4.3\nAblation studies\nEffects of finetuning SSL frontend.\nFrom Table 2, we see that the frontend finetuning helps to\nfurther decrease the EER for SLIM. The finetuned version of SLIM performs better than the rest on\n(In-the-wild, MLAAD-EN), while providing comparable performance on (ASVspoof2019, 2021).\nHowever, it should be noted that the interpretation of style-linguistics mismatch becomes difficult\nafter finetuning, since the two subspace representations may no longer be disentangled.\nEffects of classification backend.\nIn the Stage 2, subspace representations are sent into ASP+MLP\nlayers, which output 256-dim embeddings to fuse with the dependency features. Previous works\nhave shown that different backend architectures may lead to a significant difference in the detec-\ntion performance [75]. With the input fixed (dependency features and subspace embeddings), we\nfind that removing the ASP and MLP layers degrades EER across the four datasets (Table 4, Ap-\npendix A.5), while using the LCNN [80] or LLGF [75] backends improves EER on ASVspoof2019\nand ASVspoof2021, but not on In-the-wild and MLAAD-EN.\n5\nConclusion\nWe present SLIM, a new ADD framework that models the style-linguistics mismatch to detect\ndeepfakes. Without requiring more labelled data or the added cost of end-to-end finetuning on\npretrained encoders, SLIM outperforms existing benchmarks on out-of-domain datasets, while\nbeing competitive on in-domain datasets. The learned style-linguistics dependency features are\ncomplementary to the individual pretrained style and linguistics subspace representations and also\nfacilitate result interpretation.\nLimitations\nSince our framework explicitly focuses on style-linguistics mismatch, it is possible\nthat real speech samples with atypical style-linguistics dependency (e.g., samples similar Figure 4 or\ndysarthric speech [56]) may be misclassified as fakes. One countermeasure is to increase the diversity\nof real speech in the Stage 1 self-supervised training. Also, although SLIM can benefit from frontend\nfinetuning and more advanced backends, this would affect the feature interpretation and will require\nmodified training approaches. We plan to explore these directions in the future.\n9\nReferences\n[1] Nor Aishah Ahad and Sharipah Soaad Syed Yahaya. Sensitivity analysis of welch\u2019st-test.

IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing,\n2023.\nA\nAppendix\nA.1\nLayer-wise analysis of pretrained SSL models\nAs mentioned in Section. 3.2.1, we use the Wav2vec-XLSR model finetuned for emotion recognition\n(Wav2vec-SER) and speech recognition (Wav2vec-ASR) tasks to extract the style and linguistics\nrepresentations, respectively.\nThe style representation is based on the pretrained model obtained from https://huggingface.\nco/ehcalabres/wav2vec2-lg-xlsr-en-speech-emotion-recognition and the linguistics\n14\nrepresentation is based on the pretrained model obtained from https://huggingface.co/\njonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-english. To obtain a maximal disentanglement\nbetween the two subspace representations, we calculate Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient\nvalues between different layers from the two models to examine the layer-wise similarity. These\ncorrelation values and our final layer selection are demonstrated in Figure 5. Based on existing\nworks, which showed how linguistics and paralinguistics information propagate through layers, we\nchoose layer 0-10 from Wav2vec-SER backbone to represent style information, and layer 14-21 from\nWav2vec-ASR backbone to represent linguistics information. The correlation values between these\ntwo groups are shown close to 0, indicating a better disentanglement.\nFigure 5: Spearman correlation coefficients calculated across all layers from two pretrained Wav2vec-\nXLSR backbones. Blue highlights layers 0-10 from Wav2vec-SER to represent style information.\nRed highlights layers 14-21 from Wav2vec-ASR to represent linguistics information. The correlation\nvalues between the selected layers can be read from the overlapping region.\nA.2\nDataset details\nTable 3 describes the details of datasets used for Stage 1 and Stage 2 training and evaluation. Figure 6\nshows the projected WavLM embeddings for real and fake samples from the four employed datasets\nusing t-SNE. We choose WavLM since it is the top-performing model in the single-encoder category\n(Table 2). For both classes, an overlap can be seen between ASVspoof2019 and ASVspoof2021\nsamples, while samples from In-the-wild and MLAAD-EN can be separated nearly perfectly. This\ncorroborates with the results reported in Table 2 where all employed ADD systems trained on\nASVspoof2019 perform better on ASVspoof2021 than In-the-wild and MLAAD-EN.\nA.3\nDetails of the compression module\nFigure 7 shows the architecture of the compression module. The input is first passed through a pooling\nlayer to obtain an average of different SSL layer outputs. Since the goal of compression modules is to\nproject the original style/linguistics embeddings to a subspace where the compressed embeddings can\nbe maximally correlated, we use bottleneck layers to remove the redundant information that is not\nshared across the two subspaces. Similar to the design of an autoencoder [70], the bottleneck layer\nfirst compresses the feature dimension from 1024-dim to 256-dim, then recovers it back to 1024-dim.\nIn practice, we found using only one bottleneck layer is enough to obtain meaningful compressed\nrepresentations. A projection head is applied at the end to reduce the final output dimension to 256.\nA.4\nPyTorch implementation of the Stage 1 training objective\nAlgorithm 1 shows a PyTorch-style implementation of the Stage 1 training objective, which minimizes\nthe cross-subspace distance loss and an intra-subspace redundancy loss.

That said, large-scale automatic\nspeech translation systems today lack key features that help machine-mediated communication feel seamless\nwhen compared to human-to-human dialogue. In this work, we introduce a family of models that enable\nend-to-end expressive and multilingual translations in a streaming fashion. First, we contribute an improved\nversion of the massively multilingual and multimodal SeamlessM4T model\u2014SeamlessM4T v2. This newer\nmodel, incorporating an updated UnitY2 framework, was trained on more low-resource language data. The\nexpanded version of SeamlessAlign adds 114,800 hours of automatically aligned data for a total of 76\nlanguages. SeamlessM4T v2 provides the foundation on which our two newest models, SeamlessExpressive\nand SeamlessStreaming, are initiated. SeamlessExpressive enables translation that preserves vocal\nstyles and prosody. Compared to previous efforts in expressive speech research, our work addresses certain\nunderexplored aspects of prosody, such as speech rate and pauses, while also preserving the style of one\u2019s voice.\nAs for SeamlessStreaming, our model leverages the Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA)\nmechanism to generate low-latency target translations without waiting for complete source utterances. As the\nfirst of its kind, SeamlessStreaming enables simultaneous speech-to-speech/text translation for multiple\nsource and target languages. To understand the performance of these models, we combined novel and modified\nversions of existing automatic metrics to evaluate prosody, latency, and robustness. For human evaluations, we\nadapted existing protocols tailored for measuring the most relevant attributes in the preservation of meaning,\nnaturalness, and expressivity. To ensure that our models can be used safely and responsibly, we implemented\nthe first known red-teaming effort for multimodal machine translation, a system for the detection and\nmitigation of added toxicity, a systematic evaluation of gender bias, and an inaudible localized watermarking\nmechanism designed to dampen the impact of deepfakes. Consequently, we bring major components from\nSeamlessExpressive and SeamlessStreaming together to form Seamless, the first publicly available\nsystem that unlocks expressive cross-lingual communication in real-time. In sum, Seamless gives us a pivotal\nlook at the technical foundation needed to turn the Universal Speech Translator from a science fiction concept\ninto a real-world technology.

Introduction\nGerman literary critic Friedrich Schlegel once said, \u201cWhat is lost in the good or excellent translation is precisely\nthe best.\u201d When applied to speech, this sentiment implies that even when a translation accurately renders the\nsemantic meaning of an utterance, certain defining elements of speech may be lost in the process (Schuller\net al., 2013).\nWhile the specific constituents of what Schlegel deemed the best are open for interpretation, the speech\ntranslation research community has long homed in on two components: the indexical (i.e., components marking\nthe characteristics of a person) and pragmatical (i.e., the way communication works in social situations)\ncomponents of speech that make human communication what it is. For speech to be natural, it relies on\nthe indexical or revelatory nature of the human voice (Costello, 2000). A speech translation system that\nincorporates features that help a listener make inferences about a speaker\u2019s personhood bolsters the naturalness\nof a machine-mediated interaction (Waytz et al., 2014). Preserving vocal style also involves capturing the\nprosodic elements of speech (e.g., pitch, stress, rhythm), which are key in facilitating the expression of meaning,\nemotions, and intent (Aguero et al., 2006; Anumanchipalli et al., 2012). Next, human speech and translation\nare sensitive to pragmatic nuances such as turn-taking and timing controls (Cokely, 1986; Levinson, 2016).\nPicture how human simultaneous interpreters work: they find just the right balance between low-latency and\naccurate translations. Waiting too long stifles the flow of communication, while going too fast compromises\nthe overall quality of a translation.\nExisting research efforts aimed at preserving these intrinsically human features in translation have led to the\nindependent development of expressive and streaming speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) systems. On the\nexpressive front, recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have integrated voice style transfer via speech\nlanguage model (Wang et al., 2023a; Kharitonov et al., 2022), flow matching (Le et al., 2023) and diffusion\nmodel (Shen et al., 2023). These approaches subsequently inspired S2ST models designed to preserve the\nsource speech\u2019s vocal style and style qualities with a cascaded architecture. Despite these advances, an open,\ncomprehensive S2ST system capturing semantic translation, rhythm, pauses, and sentence-level preservation\nof the style of one\u2019s voice has yet to be realized. Streaming wise, recent efforts have explored how different\nsimultaneous translation policies (e.g., rule-based or learnable policies) could be deployed to produce systems\nthat strike a balance between low latency and high-quality translations (Ma et al., 2019a; Arivazhagan et al.,\n2019; Ma et al., 2020c). That said, existing research investments in streaming have homed in on speech-to-text\ntranslation (S2TT), and the few that are S2ST compatible are limited in language coverage. Moreover, most\nstreaming translation systems focus on bilingual communication, limiting their utility in contexts where a\ngroup of speakers converse in multiple different languages.\nTo advance research in multilingual expressive and streaming speech translation, we introduce SeamlessM4T\nv2, SeamlessExpressive, and SeamlessStreaming. SeamlessM4T v2 is the foundational multilingual and\nmultimodal model on which the latter two models are initialized. As an improved version of SeamlessM4T,\nSeamlessM4T v2 delivers state-of-the-art semantic accuracy across different speech and text translation tasks\nwhile supporting nearly 100 languages as input speech or text. This new version features multitask-UnitY2\nwith its non-auto-regressive unit decoder and hierarchical upsampling, making predicting units much more\ndata-efficient. The new w2v-BERT 2.0 speech encoder of SeamlessM4T v2 was pre-trained on 4.5M hours\nof unlabeled audio data, and the multitask model was finetuned with more supervision from automatically\naligned pairs to boost SeamlessM4T v2\u2019s performance on low-resource languages. Built using commissioned\nand publicly available datasets, SeamlessExpressive enables translation that preserves vocal style and\nprosody (e.g., rhythm and tone). The model supports translations from and into English in five languages. To\nour knowledge, SeamlessExpressive is the first model to enable expressive S2ST from and into English and\nsupports underexplored aspects of prosody such as speech rate and pauses. Our SeamlessStreaming model\nleverages the Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA) (Ma et al., 2023) mechanism to generate\nlow-latency target translations without waiting for complete source utterances. As the first of its kind to\nprovide many-to-many translations in a simultaneous manner, SeamlessStreaming supports the same\nlanguage coverage as the scale of SeamlessM4T v2 in ASR, S2TT, and S2ST tasks.\nTo comprehensively evaluate our systems, we combined existing and newly developed metrics (Section 9.2).\nFor expressivity, we developed two new automatic metrics that measure prosody\u2014AutoPCP and a rhythm\n3\nDATA\nLabeled & Pseudo-Labeled\nExpressive Data\nExpressive audio aligned data\nAutomatically aligned data\nLabeled &\nPseudo-Labeled Data\nMODELING\nSEAMLESSM4T V2\nSEAMLESSSTREAMING\nSEAMLESS\nSEAMLESSEXPRESSIVE\nEVALUATION\nExpressive\nRobustness\nHuman\nEvaluation\nRESPONSIBLE AI\nSEAMLESSWM\nRedTeaming\nToxicity\nGender Bias\nFigure 1 - An overview of the technical components of Seamless and how they fit together.\nevaluation toolkit. For human evaluation, we used Cross-lingual Semantic Textual Similarity (XSTS) (Licht\net al., 2022) to measure semantics, Mean Opinion Score (MOS) to measure the speech quality of all of our\nmodels, and a modified version of the Prosodic Consistency Protocol (PCP) (Huang et al., 2023) to measure\nthe extent to which the expressive qualities in source and target audio are matched. For latency, we used\nEnding Offset (see Section 5.2.3) for speech output (i.e., the time between when a person finishes speaking\nand the last translated speech being generated) and an adapted version of Average Lagging (Ma et al., 2019a,\n2020b) (i.e., a metric that quantifies the degree to which a listener is out of sync with a speaker with regards\nto the number of seconds in the source speech) and Length-Adaptive Average Lagging (Papi et al., 2022)\nfor text output. Moreover, we used well-known metrics such as BLEU, chrF, and Blaser 2.0 to measure\ntranslation quality automatically. Lastly, we tested for robustness towards noise and vocal style variations.\nTo ensure that our models are built safely and ethically, we took a four-pronged approach to Responsible AI\nby implementing 1) the first known red-teaming effort for machine translation, 2) added-toxicity detection and\nmitigation, 3) a systematic evaluation of gender bias, and 4) an inaudible, localized watermarking mechanism\nnamed SeamlessWM . We also introduce the new concept of a metric card (Section 9.2) that compiles\ndetails of our evaluation and Responsible AI metrics.\nCombining these building blocks, our unified model Seamless (comprising of SeamlessExpressive and\nSeamlessStreaming) marks the first publicly available system that unlocks expressive cross-lingual\ncommunication in real-time (see Figure 1).\nCrucially, Seamless gives us a pivotal look at the tech-\nnical foundation needed to transform the Universal Speech Translator from a science fiction concept\nto a real-world technology.\nTo spur further research into related domains and make our work avail-\nable to the various communities that could benefit from our effort, we publicly release the following at\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication:\n\u2022 Models & code: SeamlessM4T v2, SeamlessExpressive, SeamlessStreaming, and Seamless\nmodels\n\u2022 Automatically aligned data models, code, and metadata: SeamlessAlign data and Sonar speech\nencoders\n\u2022 Evaluation tools: AutoPCP, rhythm evaluation toolkit, and a multilingual alignment extraction toolkit\nbased on the UnitY2 aligner\n\u2022 Responsible AI tools: SeamlessWM detector\nThe rest of the article is structured as follows: Section 2 contextualizes the sociotechnical need for expressive\nand streaming speech translation via an interview study with users who experience language barriers in their\nday-to-day lives.

Beyond Words: Expressive and Streaming Speech-to-Speech Trans-\nlation\nIn this section, we discuss the sociotechnical need for and the current technical landscape behind devel-\noping systems that facilitate expressive and streaming speech-to-speech translation. Then, we outline our\ncontributions by summarizing the capabilities and language coverage for each of our models.\n2.1 Towards Naturalistic Speech-to-Speech Translation\nFor long, investments in natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation research have coalesced\naround the text modality (NLLB Team et al., 2022; Seamless Communication et al., 2023). While this has\ngiven rise to systems that help us translate books, webpages, and text messages, speech translation has lagged\nbehind in terms of language coverage and performance. As a denser modality, the very paralinguistic features\n(e.g., prosody, tone, timing controls, etc.) that make speech challenging from a computational perspective are\nalso why S2ST systems are filled with promises (Kraut et al., 1992; Nakamura, 2009). The consummate system,\nwhich resembles the fictional Universal Speech Translator in Star Trek, would seamlessly offer expressive and\nreal-time translation without excessive tinkering. Fading into the background, such a tool would provide\nutility without the drawbacks of existing paradigms\u2014from waiting for translations to begin only after the\ncompletion of a sentence (i.e., offline systems that perform consecutive translations) to monotonic outputs\nlacking in character.\nTo better understand user needs when it comes to speech translation, we ground our research on the lived\nexperiences of individuals who are dependent on translation technologies in their everyday lives. While many\npeople use translation technologies while traveling or for other recreational purposes, this group of individuals\nrelies on them for essential information gathering and communication.\nAccordingly, we interviewed 34\nparticipants from diverse immigrant backgrounds to understand present limitations in real-world deployments\nof S2ST systems. The goal of this study was to understand how our interviewees, who are either Mandarin or\nSpanish speakers with limited English proficiency, navigate everyday communication in the United States. The\nnarratives drawn from these interviews not only spotlight the integral role of machine translation in achieving\neveryday goals, but they give us an empirical window into how S2ST systems designed with naturalistic\ncommunication (i.e., with expressivity and streaming) in mind could help this population gain confidence in\nself-expression and spur further integration into mainstream society.\n2.1.1 Meeting translation needs\nAs well documented by previous research, low proficiency in the languages of the receiving societies is a\nmajor source of anxiety and stress for many immigrants (Ding and Hargraves, 2009; Lueck and Wilson, 2011;\nDelander et al., 2005). Aside from acquiring language proficiency through learning, many tap into other\nstrategies to bridge communication gaps (Hutchins, 2009; Orellana et al., 2003). In our interviews, we find that\nwhile most participants rely on both their personal networks and translation applications in their everyday\nlives, most day-to-day translation work is conducted by the latter (especially for those with higher degrees of\ntechnological literacy). Moreover, even though many commercially available translation platforms support\nboth text and speech translation, the bulk of the translation tasks our participants perform via apps remain\ntext-centric (i.e., translating emails, work-related documents, etc.).\nThis observation does not suggest that text-based translation needs supplant speech-based ones. The disparity\ncould largely be attributed to the performance delta between text and speech-based translation tools and\nthe lack of familiarity with speech translation functions in widely adopted translation platforms (Seamless\n5\nCommunication et al., 2023). Compared to speech translation systems, text-based tools have enjoyed deeper\nmaturity and commercial viability. User familiarity, alongside greater confidence levels in the generated\noutputs, drives more users to deploy text-based systems even in contexts where speech is used. It is, for\nexample, more common for participants (n=26/34) to translate subtitles rather than audio speech when\nwatching the news or television shows (even though the translation apps they use support both text and\nspeech translation). One participant added that \u201cspeech translation just feels foreign\u201d and that they would\nprobably engage with it more if they saw more people using it. This is a sentiment that reverberated across\nthe sample population.\n2.1.2 Real-time translation in synchronous contexts\nDespite heavy reliance on text-based translation, many participants yearn for reliable speech translation\nsystems to help them in real time. In fact, 20 of the 34 interviewees have previously used commercially\navailable translation platforms supporting speech. That said, using translation apps to perform consecutive\nspeech translations was universally regarded as a workaround in time-sensitive situations, an imperfect solution\nto a problem. A Mandarin speaker, for example, describes a recent incident when checking out at a local\ngrocer: \u201cI had to give the cashier the phone, ask her to direct her question to it, and then wait for the app to\ntranslate. You can tell people around me were a little annoyed.\u201d\nFor all interviewees, real-time translation would be particularly handy in social situations that require\nsynchronous communication, whether it is face-to-face or digitally mediated. For instance, even though one\ncould rely on text translation to render a menu legible, conversing with or responding to questions from a\nserver poses an issue. Barriers like this not only adversely affect self-esteem but also prevent many participants\nfrom partaking in new social or cultural experiences. One participant notes that even if a speech translation\nsystem does not enable bidirectional communication, having the capability to interpret a question as it is\nbeing asked would be helpful, later adding: \u201cat least I could gesture back or use simple English to tell someone\nwhat I want.\u201d\nFor some, the lack of reliable S2ST compels them to rely on family, friends, or coworkers to help meet\ncross-lingual conversational needs in both informal and professional settings (Orellana et al., 2003). However,\nhaving network resources to tap into this social workaround is not a given, and even those who have access to\ncultural brokers (S\u00b4anchez and Orellana, 2006) express that this form of linguistic dependency stifles integration\ninto their receiving society. In light of these constraints, one participant fantasizes that having a tool that\n\u201ctranslates like a human, especially in circumstances where human interpreters are unavailable, could be a\ngame-changer.\u201d\n2.1.3 Expressive translation and the preservation of vocal style & prosody\nWhen probed on what the next generation of speech-translation technologies should look like, many participants\nstress that beyond simultaneous translation, future systems should enable them to communicate naturally. For\nthem, natural communication could be interpreted in many ways\u2014from using slang or idioms to not slowing\ndown when directing input at a translating app. That said, the most commonly shared conceptualization\n(n=29/34) of naturalness is for S2ST systems to support prosodic preservation and the preservation of the\nstyle of one\u2019s voice.\nIf text directs more attention to the content of a message, then speech more deeply emphasizes the person\nbehind an utterance (Kraut et al., 1992). The desire for translation outputs to reflect speaker characteristics,\nas framed by an interviewee, suggests that S2ST systems can do way more than convey semantic information\n(Huang et al., 2023). Without encoding the expressive nature of speech, many participants express that a\nmajor fear of engaging with S2ST in their day-to-day lives is the risk of misaligned intent. Consider this\ncomment by a Mandarin speaker: \u201cImagine if I wanted to say something sarcastically. If the system does not\ntranslate that properly, it could lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings.\u201d\nExtending this sentiment, other participants noted that faithfully reproducing vocal style and prosody in\ntheir speech breathes character into their self-expression, giving listeners a more comprehensive sense of their\nintent (Du et al., 2021). According to a Spanish-speaking participant, systems that go beyond just words\ncan deeply transform the quality of cross-lingual communication: \u201cOur tone is a part of our personality, and\n6\nit changes based on context and the language we are speaking. It\u2019s also a matter of candor when we speak\nSpanish. We get very passionate.\u201d\nReverberating across the interviews is the view that translation systems that deliver language coverage,\nexpressivity, and streaming could serve as a unique tool that helps them better integrate into everyday society.\nEquipping those with language barriers with the ability to communicate in real-time without erasing their\nindividuality could make prosaic activities like ordering food, communicating with a shopkeeper, or scheduling\na medical appointment\u2014all of which abilities non-immigrants take for granted\u2014more ordinary.\n2.2 Expressive and Streaming S2ST Today\nHaving explored the social need behind expressive and streaming S2ST systems, we now review existing efforts\ndirected at these research areas.\n2.2.1 Expressive systems\nExpressive speech systems have long been of technical interest to researchers in a multidisciplinary context.\nCombining linguistics insights and computational methods, developing systems that can accurately produce\nhumanlike utterances both at the semantic and paralinguistics levels becomes ever more pressing as the\nvolume of auditory content (i.e., podcasts, audiobooks, short-form videos, etc.) and voice-assisted technologies\n(e.g., smart home systems, autonomous driving voice controls, etc.) are on the rise. As a technical foundation,\nexpressive speech systems could meaningfully augment the performance of a wide variety of technologies,\nranging from robotics to digital assistants.\nIn the translation context, expressive speech preservation with conventional cascaded S2ST systems can be\nrealized in several ways. To preserve pre-defined word or token-level paralinguistic characteristics such as\nemphasis, automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) need to transcribe speech not only into text but also\ninto pre-defined prosody labels. Subsequently, a machine translation model then translates or maps these\nprosody labels from the source to the target text. Finally, a text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) model synthesizes\nthe speech output with the corresponding labels (Aguero et al., 2006; Do et al., 2017). For this pipeline to\nwork, parallel data with aligned prosody labels is necessary.\nTo achieve sentence-level preservation of the style of one\u2019s voice, TTS systems supporting cross-lingual transfer\nthrough a set of embeddings that disentangle speech nuances such as semantics (i.e., characters or phonemes),\nstress or tone, vocal styles, and language are typically required (Liu and Mak, 2019; Casanova et al., 2022).\nRecent advances in TTS have enabled voice style transfer through prompting via speech language model\n(Wang et al., 2023a), flow matching (Le et al., 2023), and diffusion model (Shen et al., 2023). Notably, TTS\nmodels can now be trained on non-parallel multilingual datasets and achieve cross-lingual transfer when\nstacked with translation models that predict semantic units (Borsos et al., 2023; Rubenstein et al., 2023a;\nDong et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c). Relatedly, voice-aligned speech could be generated with controllable\nTTS models, and such data enables the training of direct S2ST systems that support translations from source\nspeech into target speech with a consistent vocal style (Jia et al., 2022a).\nDespite the recent advancements in TTS and direct S2ST (Zhang et al., 2023b; Rubenstein et al., 2023a), a\ncomprehensive S2ST system capturing semantic translation, rhythm, pauses, and sentence-level preservation\nof the style of one\u2019s voice have yet to be realized. Our work explicitly tackles preserving all such features\nin S2ST under a unified framework. To build our model, we first focused on addressing S2ST data paucity\nwith aligned prosodic patterns and systematic evaluation methods. Signal-based objective metrics, such as\nmel-cepstral distortion (MCD), exist for TTS systems, but parallel S2ST data with aligned prosody and voice\nstyle are hard to come by (Neubig et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2022b; Ward et al., 2023). To rectify this, we devised\ndata and textless vocal style conversion strategies to build parallel S2ST data with aligned expressivity and\nreference-free cross-lingual automatic evaluation methods that focus on the prosodic aspects of speech.\n2.2.2 Streaming systems\nIn contrast to offline systems, which only start translating after the completion of a sentence, streaming\nsystems translate as source utterances are being produced (Cho and Esipova, 2016). The biggest technical\n7\nchallenge of effective streaming is striking a balance between low latency and translation quality. More\nspecifically, a system with very low latency may miss important information, rendering a translation subpar,\nwhile a system with high latency creates excessive delays, compromising the flow of a conversation. Typically\nempowered by simultaneous translation policies, advanced streaming S2ST systems should dynamically decide\nwhether to translate the next token or pause translating to absorb additional contextual information.\nResearch into simultaneous translation policies may be categorized into two principal categories: rule-based\npolicies (Cho and Esipova, 2016; Dalvi et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019a) and learnable policies. The main\ndifference between the two policies lies in how a system waits for more input before translating. Rule-based\npolicies rely on heuristics, such as waiting for k tokens to be read before translating, while learnable policies use\nalgorithms such reinforcement learning (Gu et al., 2017b) or monotonic attention to make this decision. Among\nthe latter, monotonic-attention based models have been deemed to produce state-of-the-art performance in\nnavigating the latency-quality trade-off (Raffel et al., 2017; Chiu* and Raffel*, 2018; Arivazhagan et al., 2019;\nMa et al., 2020c). Recently, there has been a growing interest in adapting simultaneous policies to model\nspeech inputs (Ren et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020b, 2021; Wang et al., 2020b). To direct further attention to this\nunderexplored area of research, recent shared tasks, such as one focused on simultaneous translation organized\nby the International Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies, have been established (Agarwal et al., 2023;\nAnastasopoulos et al., 2022, 2021; Ansari et al., 2020). These shared tasks serve as crucial avenues spurring\nresearchers toward developing state-of-the-art models under standardized conditions.\nDespite ongoing efforts dedicated to research on simultaneous translation, certain gaps require further\nexploration. For one, most research on streaming has focused on speech-to-text rather than speech-to-speech\napplications. The difference in output modality presents a technical challenge due to data and modeling\nconstraints. Relatedly, most existing streaming models are designed in an ad hoc manner that makes them\nparticularly sensitive to the dynamics of the offline models they are initialized on. For example, if improvements\nare made to a foundational offline model, it is typically quite challenging to adapt a newer streaming model\nto take advantage of these technical gains.\nContemporary streaming models predominantly focus on bilingual translations. However, many low-latency\napplication scenarios consist of multiple speakers from diverse language backgrounds, calling for models that\ncan process multilingual inputs and outputs simultaneously in an efficient manner. The development of\nmultilingual streaming models, also an underexplored area of research, has an added advantage\u2014cross-lingual\ntransfer, which allows related languages to learn from one another (NLLB Team et al., 2022; Nguyen and\nChiang, 2017).\nMoreover, in the domain of streaming S2ST, the research has predominantly focused on a cascaded approach\ninvolving a sequential series of processing steps. However, this approach is suboptimal for real-time streaming\napplications, a limitation that could be alleviated by direct S2ST models (especially when the scale of training\nincreases). Moreover, the cascaded model has issues such as compounding errors, additional disk storage, and\ncomputation time (Bentivogli et al., 2021; Seamless Communication et al., 2023). To address these issues, we\ncombine SeamlessM4T v2, our multilingual and multimodal foundational model, and Efficient Monotonic\nMultihead Attention (EMMA), our simultaneous policy, to build a streaming translation model that performs\ndirect translations from speech into both speech and text for many-to-many directions in real time.\n2.2.3 The overarching goals of this effort\nIn light of the gaps delineated above, our work seeks to advance speech translation in the following ways:\n1. Developing key data sets and foundational models necessary to create a unified system that enables\nend-to-end, multilingual, and real-time speech translation that captures a broader range of vocal style\nand expressive preservation.\n2. Expanding language coverage both in terms of the number of supported languages and translation\ndirections when it comes to SeamlessStreaming and SeamlessExpressive translation systems (i.e.,\ngoing beyond translations into English by including translation from English).\n3. Maintaining systematic evaluations of our systems throughout our workflow to ensure high-quality and\nsafe performance. This allows us to understand how to direct our efforts to make both current and\n8\nfuture iterations of our work more equitable and fair for different user populations.\n2.3 Overview of Model Capabilities & Languages\nToday, broadly accessible speech translation models cover anywhere between 21 to 113 source languages\ndepending on the wide range of tasks involved (Zhang et al., 2023a; Rubenstein et al., 2023b). To build a\nunified, multimodal, and multitask model that can handle both speech and text, SeamlessM4T v2 covers\n100 languages as speech input and 96 languages as text input. It can output 96 languages as text and 36\nlanguages as speech. SeamlessExpressive, capable of preserving rhythm, pauses, and sentence-level style of\none\u2019s voice, is equipped to handle six languages\u2014English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish. As\nfor SeamlessStreaming, our low-latency model can handle the same language coverage as SeamlessM4T\nv2 on ASR, S2TT, and S2ST tasks. We summarize information on our models\u2019 supported capabilities and\nlanguages in Table 1. Further details on the table header are provided below.\nCode.\nWe represent each language with a three-letter ISO 639-3 code.\nLanguage.\nThere may be multiple ways to refer to the same language; due to formatting limitations, only one\nversion is included below. The language names have been cross-referenced with major linguistic information\nplatforms such as Ethnologue (Lewis, 2009) and Glottolog (Hammarstr\u00a8om et al., 2022).\nScript.\nWe provide script information in ISO 15924 codes for writing systems.\nResource level.\nWe categorize the speech resource level as high, medium, or low depending on the volume of\navailable primary data for S2TT into English (with x the amount of primary data in hours, high if x > 1000,\nmedium if x \u2208[500, 1000] and low if x \u2208[0, 500]).\nPrimary data. Primary data is defined as open-source S2TT and pseudo-labeled ASR data. Absent such data,\nwe report the language as zero-shot (when evaluating S2TT into English).\nSource.\nWe indicate whether a source language is in the speech (Sp) or text (Tx) modality, or both.\nTarget.\nWe indicate whether a target language is in the speech (Sp) or text (Tx) modality, or both.\n9\nCode\nLanguage name\nScript\nResource\nM4T v2\nStreaming /

SeamlessM4T v2\nThe first step towards a unified Seamless model, capable of expressive cross-lingual translation in real-time,\nstarts with improving SeamlessM4T to give rise to SeamlessM4T v2 \u2014a foundational model with state-\nof-the-art semantic accuracy, wide language coverage, and multitasking capabilities (from and into text or\nspeech). In terms of coverage, SeamlessM4T v2 supports the same tasks as SeamlessM4T with the same\nset of languages detailed in Table 1 and summarized in Table 2.\nWhen designing the newer version of SeamlessM4T, adaptability to simultaneous translation was central.\nDue to the length mismatch between discrete acoustic units and text semantic tokens, the T2U model\nof SeamlessM4T responsible for generating units tends to hallucinate or truncate the output. This is\nparticularly problematic if the model is only fed partial input and is tasked with generating partial outputs for\nreal-time applications. For this reason, we pivoted in SeamlessM4T v2 to non-autoregressive text-to-unit\ndecoding in order to decouple generation from output length prediction. With this non-autoregressive T2U\ndecoder, SeamlessM4T v2\u2019s S2ST inference speed has improved by 3x (see Appendix I.1) laying the ground\nfor effective real-time translation with SeamlessStreaming.\nWe followed the same recipe from SeamlessM4T and relied on pre-training multiple blocks before finetuning\nthem jointly as a unified model. Our unified model, previously a multitask-UnitY architecture, was upgraded\nto multitask-UnitY2, boasting a stronger non-autoregressive T2U model. Compared to its predecessor,\nUnitY2 delivers stronger T2U performance thanks to its hierarchical upsampling from subwords to characters\nand then to units. This upsampling makes pre-training multilingual T2U models much more data-efficient.\nSeamlessM4T v2 also used 4.5M hours of unlabeled audio data to learn its self-supervised input speech\npresentation with w2v-BERT 2.0 (4.5x the amount used in v1). SeamlessAlign was further extended to\ncover more low-resource languages, enabling increased representation of these languages, ultimately improving\nthe downstream semantic accuracy.\nThe key ingredients of the SeamlessM4T v2 recipe are:\n(a) Unlabeled, human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, or automatically aligned data used in the different pre-\ntraining and finetuning stages (Section 3.1). Figure 2 gives a bird\u2019s eye view of the different sources of\ndata and how they were used.\n(b) T2TT model pre-trained on NLLB data (NLLB Team et al., 2022) in nearly 100 languages (Seamless\nCommunication et al., 2023).\n(c) Conformer speech encoder pre-trained with the w2v-BERT 2.0 algorithm. We scaled up the amount of\nunlabeled data from 1 million to 4.5 million hours of audio (Section 3.2.1).\n(d) X2T model trained on different sources of S2TT data (human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and automatically\naligned). This model is trained with knowledge distillation to jointly support T2TT, ASR, and S2TT\nby combining the models from (a) and (b) (Section 3.2.2).\n(e) UnitY2 based on a novel non-autoregressive T2U decoder architecture with hierarchical modeling of\nsubword, character, and discrete units. UnitY2 relies on unsupervised multilingual character-to-unit\nalignment learning and introduces a novel span-based glancing for the T2U decoder (Section 3.3).\n(f) Multitask-UnitY2 model finetuned on speech-to-unit data (pseudo-labeled with a teacher T2U or\nautomatically aligned) to build on the model from (c) with a student T2U model (Section 3.4).\n12\nSEAMLESSM4T-NLLB\nDense transformer encoder-decoder\nTEXT-TO-TEXT DATA\nNLLB-SEED\nPUBLICBITEXT\nAutomatically Aligned bitexts,\nMMTBT, SMTBT\nNLLB Team et al.

An overview of the pre-training and finetuning data used in SeamlessM4T v2.\nWe evaluated SeamlessM4T-Large v2 (a 2.3B-size model) across all its supported tasks [ASR, T2TT,\nS2TT, S2ST, T2ST (zero-shot)] and discuss its results in Section 3.5.\n3.1 Data for Speech Translation\nIn speech translation, as is the case for any other sequence modeling task, achieving state-of-the-art perfor-\nmances hinges on the availability of high-quality paired data used for learning. In comparison to text-to-text\ntranslation (T2TT), the amount of human-labeled speech data is scarce. To address this shortage of labeled\ndata, we leaned on three techniques from the first version of SeamlessM4T (Seamless Communication et al.,\n2023): (1) the pre-training of different submodels on richer tasks (e.g., T2TT with SeamlessM4T-NLLB or\nunlabeled audio with w2v-BERT 2.0), (2) automatically aligning pairs, and (3) pseudo-labeling ASR data.\nFigure 2 depicts the main building blocks of SeamlessM4T v2 and the different sources of data used in each\npre-training or finetuning stage.\n3.1.1 SeamlessAlign\nWe improved the Sonar speech encoders and increased their language coverage to 76 languages. This resulted\nin an improvement not only in the quantity of data in SeamlessAlign, but also its quality and representation\nof low-resource languages.\nExtended SONAR encoders.\nThe backbone of speech-to-text and speech-to-speech automatic alignment is\na fixed-size multilingual and multimodal sentence representation with the property that similar sentences are\nclose in that embedding space, independently of the language and modality. We used the Sonar text encoder\ndeveloped by Duquenne et al. (2023b), which was already successfully deployed in Seamless Communication\net al. (2023). We trained a new set of SONAR speech encoders using the same teacher-student approach to\nincrease the language coverage from 37 to 76, again using ASR data only. We also revisited the training data\nmix to remove low-quality datasets after inspection. Evaluating the various iterations of the speech encoder\ndirectly in an end-to-end automatic alignment pipeline would require to perform this alignment and then\ntrain S2TT or S2ST translation system on the aligned data, potentially comparing different thresholds of\nthe Sonar score. This is a very compute-intensive recipe. Instead, following Seamless Communication et al.\n(2023), we evaluated our speech encoders using the Sonar text decoder and report BLEU scores for S2TT\ninto English as a proxy for the speech encoders\u2019 performance when used for automatically aligning pairs.\nDetailed statistics for each language are shown in Tables 61 and 62 under the appendix. A summary and\ncomparison to Whisper-Large-v21 is given in Table 3. While our speech encoders perform less effectively\n1The new version v3 of Whisper seems to perform less well on S2TT\n13\nModel\ndeu\nfra\nrus\narb\nisl\nswh\nuzn\nIndian\nAvg\nWhisper-Large-v2\n34.6\n32.3\n27.8\n25.5\n9.1\n7.2\n6.0\n13.4\n19.1\nSonar\n32.7\n31.2\n26.5\n28.7\n17.3\n22.6\n17.5\n17.1\n22.0\nTable 3 - sacreBLEU scores on Fleurs test set for S2TT. The column Indian gives the average performance over 13\nIndian languages (asm, ben, guj, hin, kan, mal, mar, npi, pan, snd, tel, tam and urd). The average performance is\ncalculated over 73 languages which are supported by both models.\nthan Whisper for 23 languages (mostly high-resource languages like German, French, or Russian), they perform\nsubstantially better on low-resource languages (like Icelandic, Swahili, Uzbek, and many Indian languages).\nOverall, the speech encoders exhibit very competitive S2TT performance. This is even more remarkable given\nthat we used bottle-neck fixed-size representation rather than an attention mechanism, and performed fully\nzero-short S2TT (i.e., the speech encoder was not trained using translated data and the text decoder has\nnever seen speech input).\nThe speech encoders for all 76 languages are made publicly available in the SONAR repository.2\nSee\nAppendix A for a model card.\nAutomatic alignment procedure.\nThe speech encoders were subsequently used to perform speech-to-text and\nspeech-to-speech automatic alignment, following the same process as introduced in Seamless Communication\net al. (2023). Starting with 3.9 million hours of diverse raw audio originating from a publicly available\nrepository of web data, we applied a series of preprocessing steps and segmented raw audio files into sentence-\nlevel utterances through an off-the-shelf Voice Activity Detection model (Silero, 2021). The same language\nidentification model was subsequently used to triage segments into language buckets, and overlapping segments\nwere formed, following the over-segmentation approach of Duquenne et al. (2021).\nAll segments were then embedded with SONAR encoders, and indexed with the FAISS library (Johnson et al.,\n2019). Alignments were formed by retrieving the nearest neighbors of all elements in the forward (source\nin target) and backward (target in source) directions, and keeping pairs with a margin score (Artetxe and\nSchwenk, 2019) higher than a threshold:\nscore(x, y) = margin\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edcos(x, y),\nX\nz\u2208NNk(x)\ncos(x, z)\n2k\n+\nX\nv\u2208NNk(y)\ncos(y, v)\n2k\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8,\n(1)\nwhere x and y are the source and target sentences, and NNk(x) denotes the k nearest neighbors of x in the\nother language. We set k to 16, and the use ratio margin(a, b) = a/b. All code for automatically aligning data\nis made publicly available within the Stopes library (Andrews et al., 2022).3\nThe amount of automatically aligned speech is given in Tables 61 and 62 in the appendix (please see the\nlast three columns). All statistics are given with respect to a margin score threshold of 1.15. This value was\nobtained by limited human inspection of the aligned data and was already used in Seamless Communication\net al. (2023). Overall, this new version of SeamlessAlign has doubled its language coverage (from 37 to 76\nlanguages) and incorporated 114,800 hours of additional data:\n\u2022 English speech to non-English text (S2T eng\u2013X)\u2014approximately 45,300 hours\n\u2022 Non-English speech to English text (S2T X\u2013eng)\u2014approximately 60,200 hours\n\u2022 Non-English speech to English speech (S2S)\u2014approximately 9,300 hours\nAdding such large amounts of automatically aligned data can be a substantial computational challenge.\nTherefore, SeamlessAlign can be ranked and filtered with Sonar alignment scores.\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/SONAR\n3https://github.com/facebookresearch/stopes\n14\n3.1.2 Pseudo-labeling\nPseudo-labeling for S2TT.\nFollowing Seamless Communication et al. (2023), we circumvented the shortage\nof labeled S2TT data by pseudo-labeling available ASR data with a multilingual T2TT model (Jia et al.,\n2019; Pino et al., 2020). In this case, we used NLLB-3.3B (NLLB Team et al., 2022) with the recommended\ndecoding options. When using human-labeled data, we removed special tokens such as <silence> and\n<no-speech> from the verbatim transcriptions.\nPseudo-labeling for S2ST.\nFollowing Seamless Communication et al. (2023), we pseudo-labeled S2TT data\nusing a text-to-unit (T2U) model. This T2U model was trained on all 36 target speech languages (Section 3.2)\nand can convert text into discrete units (Tjandra et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2022a,b; Zhang et al., 2022; Chen\net al., 2023c). We also used the same 10K-units vocabulary from Seamless Communication et al. (2023). To\nextract these units, features from the 35th layer of XLS-R-1B (Babu et al., 2022) are mapped to discrete\ncategories with the k-means algorithm (k=10, 000). The k-means centroids resemble a codebook that maps\na sequence of XLS-R speech representations into a sequence of centroid indices or acoustic units. Unlike\nSeamlessM4T where we used reduced units, in SeamlessM4T v2 we used non-reduced (or duplicated)\nunits (see Section 3.3).\n3.1.3 Filtering\nWe ran the combination of human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and automatically aligned data through a series of\nfilters, described in detail below:\nToxicity filtering.\nWe removed pairs with toxicity imbalance, i.e., when the difference in the number of toxic\nitems detected in the source and target is above a certain threshold. For S2TT data, transcriptions were used\nas a proxy for speech input when counting toxic items. We set the imbalance threshold at 1.\nLength filtering.\nWe removed pairs in which the utterance is shorter than 0.1 seconds or longer than 50\nseconds. We also removed pairs where the text is longer than 250 sub-words (based on the SeamlessM4T\ntokenizer).\nSpecial characters filtering.\nWe removed pairs in which the text contains more than 20% of emojis, more\nthan 50% of punctuation, more than 50% of digits, or more than 50% of spaces.\nRepetition filtering.\nWe removed sentences with a contiguous repetition of a single character more than ten\ntimes. We additionally computed n-grams (1 \u2264n \u22644) in each text sample and filtered out the ones with less\nthan 30% unique n-grams.\nDeduplication.\nLee et al. (2021) established that training data deduplication is critical for large language\nmodel training.\nIn order to determine if two texts are duplicates, we applied a normalization process\nthat removes punctuation and non-printing characters, and then replaces all digits.\nThe filtering can\nremove duplicates where two data points have identical target text. This deduplication method is useful for\nautomatically aligned data, where the same source utterances are aligned with multiple target sentences. We\nkept up to five pairs with duplicate targets and removed the rest.\nLID filtering.\nWe discarded pairs where the target sentences do not appear to be written in the expected\nlanguages. This can be performed automatically using a language identification model with thresholds chosen\nappropriately based on the reliability of LID scores for each given language. To do so, we used the LID model\nfrom NLLB Team et al. (2022). LID filtering was performed exclusively for Dutch, English, French, German,\nItalian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish with a confidence threshold set to 0.9.\nAfter applying all the filters, the data used to train the SeamlessM4T v2 models amounts to a total of 351K\nhours in S2TT and 145K hours in S2ST, as described in Table 4\n15\nASR\nS2TT\nS2ST\nX\u2013eng\neng\u2013X\nX\u2013eng\neng\u2013X\nH\nH\nP\nA\nH\nP\nA\nP\nA\nP\nA\n47,296\n14,434\n52,977\n23,744\n8,476\n184,123\n20,377\n71,474\n5,924\n65,812\n2,352\nTable 4 - Total amounts of human-labeled (H), pseudo-labeled (P), and automatically aligned (A) audio data used to\ntrain the SeamlessM4T v2 model, measured in hours.

Following such direction, we\ncontinued to add more unlabeled speech data, increasing the amount of our pre-training data from 1M\nhours (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) to approximately 4.5M hours.\nBesides leveraging more pre-training data, we removed the random-projection quantizer (RPQ) (Chiu et al.,\n2022) and its associated loss previously incorporated in SeamlessM4T v1 (Seamless Communication et al.,\n2023).4\nAkin to v1, the v2 w2v-BERT 2.0 comprises 24 Conformer layers (Gulati et al., 2020) with\napproximately 600M parameters and the same pre-training hyperparameters.\n3.2.2 X2T: Into-text tasks\nIn SeamlessM4T, we leveraged foundational models either pre-trained on unlabeled data (w2v-BERT 2.0 for\nspeech encoder pre-training) or trained on supervised high-resource tasks (NLLB model for T2TT) to improve\nthe quality of transfer tasks (speech-to-text and speech-to-speech). To fuse these pre-trained components\nand enable meaning transfer through multiple multimodal tasks, we trained an end-to-end model with: (a) a\nspeech encoder (w2v-BERT 2.0) postfixed with a length adapter, (b) text encoder (NLLB encoder), and\n(c) a text decoder (NLLB decoder). We used the same length adaptor from Seamless Communication et al.\n(2023). The text encoder was frozen, and the model was finetuned to jointly optimize the following objective\nfunctions with respect to the speech encoder parameters \u03b8se and the shared text decoder parameters \u03b8td:\nLS2TT(\u03b8se, \u03b8td) = \u2212log p(ytext|xtext; \u03b8se, \u03b8td) = \u2212\n|y|\nX\nt=1\nlog p(ytext\ni\n|ytext\n<i , xspeech; \u03b8se, \u03b8td),\n(2)\nLT2TT(\u03b8td) = \u2212log p(ytext|xtext; \u03b8se, \u03b8td) = \u2212\n|y|\nX\nt=1\nlog p(ytext\ni\n|ytext\n<i , xtext; \u03b8td),\n(3)\nwhere xtext and xspeech are the source text and speech in the source language \u2113s, and ytext is the target text\nin the target language \u2113t. We additionally optimized an auxiliary objective function in the form of token-level\nknowledge distillation LKD to further transfer knowledge from the strong MT model to the student speech\ntranslation task (S2TT). This loss function is defined as follows:\n4As we scaled data from 1M to 4.5M hours, we encountered some optimization instability when RPQ was used. We decided\nto simply discard RPQ instead of relying on more extensive hyperparameter tuning.\n16\nLKD(\u03b8se, \u03b8td) =\n|y|\nX\nt=1\nDKL\n\u0002\np(.|ytext\n<i , xtext; \u03b8td) \u2225p(.|ytext\n<i , xspeech; \u03b8se, \u03b8td)\n\u0003\n.\n(4)\nOur triplets (xspeech, xtext, ytext) come mainly from pseudo-labeled ASR data (Section 3.1.2). Since we jointly\ntrained on ASR data, handled as translation with \u2113s = \u2113t, we replaced the translation task for the ASR\nsamples with auto-encoding (AE). As such, three additional losses are considered:\nLASR(\u03b8se, \u03b8td) = \u2212log p(xtext|xspeech; \u03b8se, \u03b8td),\n(5)\nLAE(\u03b8td) = \u2212log p(xtext|xtext; \u03b8td),\n(6)\nLKD-ASR(\u03b8se, \u03b8td) =\n|y|\nX\nt=1\nDKL\n\u0002\np(.|xtext\n<i , xtext; \u03b8td) \u2225p(.|xtext\n<i , xspeech; \u03b8se, \u03b8td)\n\u0003\n.\n(7)\nThe final loss is a weighted sum of all six losses:\nL \u221d(LS2TT + LT2TT + LKD) + \u03b1(LASR + LAE + LKD-ASR),\n(8)\nwhere \u03b1 is a scalar hyperparameter dependent on the proportion of ASR data in our mix of training data.\nWe trained our X2T model in two stages. Stage1 targeted training on supervised English ASR and into English\nS2TT data. We find that this step is necessary not only for improving the quality of X\u2013eng translations but\nalso eng\u2013X translations. In fact, we hypothesized that allowing the model to focus on one target language\nwhile finetuning multilingual speech representations shields it from the interference that can propagate back\nfrom the target side. In Stage2, we added supervised eng\u2013X S2TT and non-English ASR data to the mix.\nIn SeamlessM4T v2, we set \u03b1 (Equation (8)) to 0.04 in the first finetuning stage and 0.13 in the second\nstage. Our training batches present a mix of tasks (ASR or S2TT and the associated auxiliary losses), and\nlanguages (source only in the first stage and source-target in the second stage) with temperature sampling\n(T = 2). All speech encoder and text decoder parameters are finetuned for a total of 200K updates\u2014100K in\neach stage.\n3.3 Predicting Units with UnitY2\nSimilar to SeamlessM4T, the task of speech-to-speech translation in SeamlessM4T v2 is broken down\ninto speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and then text-to-unit conversion (T2U). While UnitY relaxes the\ntraining difficulty of direct S2ST, the T2U model often hallucinates or truncates the output. This issue can be\nattributed to the length mismatch between the speech sequence in units and the text sequence in subwords,\nthe former being on average 25 times longer. To reduce errors in the unit generation, we propose a new direct\ntwo-pass S2ST architecture, UnitY2, which enhances the unit generation of UnitY by a non-autoregressive\n(NAR) decoder that does not rely on any external aligner.\nThe overall architecture of UnitY2 is depicted in Figure 3. UnitY2 replaces the second-pass autoregressive\nunit decoder in UnitY with a NAR unit decoder. We adopted the decoder architecture of FastSpeech2 (Ren\net al., 2021b) and extended it to discrete unit generation. The original FastSpeech2 decoder, designed for\ngenerating Mel-filterbank features in TTS, relies on a variance adaptor to add different variance information\nsuch as duration, pitch, and energy as conditional inputs before decoding. Given that UnitY2 is designed to\nmodel discrete units, we only added duration information with a duration predictor; other information like\npitch or prosody are not well-preserved by discrete units (Polyak et al., 2021). The NAR unit decoder needs\nto expand the text input sequence to match the length of the unit output sequence, as such, a text-to-unit\nalignment is necessary. Unlike UnitY, UnitY2 predicts a duplicated (or non-reduced) unit sequence that\npreserves repetitive units. Although the non-reduced unit sequence is longer, fast inference with NAR unit\ngeneration can compensate for the computational overhead.\n17\n3 SEAMLESSM4T V2\nxtext(\u2113s)\nMel-Filterbanks\nextractor\n(bins=80)\nxspeech(\u2113s)\nTransformer\ntext encoder\nSEAMLESSM4T-NLLB\nConformer\nspeech encoder\nW2V-BERT 2.0\nLength\nadaptor\nTransformer\ntext decoder\nSEAMLESSM4T-NLLB\nytext(\u2113t)\nsubword-length\nT2U encoder\nsubword-to-character\nupsampler\nUnit duration predictor\ncharacter-to-unit\nupsampler\nAligner\nudup\nytext-char\nTraining supervision\nNAR unit decoder\nudup\nHiFi-GAN\nunit-vocoder\n(\u2113t)\nContinuous decoder output\nUnit duration predictor\ncharacter-to-unit\nupsampler\ncharacter-length\nT2U encoder\nytext-char\nNAR unit decoder\nudup\nPseudo-labeling\nteacher T2U\n1 UNITY2\nSpeech encoder\nText decoder\nNAR T2U\n2 Multitask-UNITY2\nText\nencoder\nSpeech\nencoder\nText decoder\nNAR T2U\nFigure 3 - Illustration of the SeamlessM4T v2 model.

Panel (3) breaks\ndown the components of SeamlessM4T v2 (a multitask-UnitY2 model) with a side panel illustration of the teacher\nT2U model used for pseudo-labeling.\nUnitY2 starts with hierarchically upsampling of the T2U encoder output from subword-length, to character-\nlength then to unit-length (Section 3.3.1). The unit duration predictor, key to the hierarchical upsampling, is\nsupervised during training by a multilingual aligner based on RAD-TTS (Shih et al., 2021) (Section 3.3.2).\nTo address the multimodality problem in the NAR generation of large-vocabulary non-reduced discrete units,\nwe propose an efficient single-pass span-based glancing training (Section 3.3.3).\n3.3.1 Hierarchical subword-to-unit upsampling\nThe T2U encoder in UnitY2 receives coarse subword-length representations from the X2T text decoder.5\nAs a first-pass decoder in UnitY2, its features are not suitable for describing acoustic details necessary for\nsubsequent unit prediction. To leverage fine-grained textual information without hindering translation quality\nor the efficiency of the X2T decoder, we propose hierarchical subword-to-unit upsampling, where we upsample\nthe subword-length T2U encoder representations to character-length then to unit-length.\nSpecifically, a subword-to-character upsampler Sub2Char repeats each subword-length representation hi\naccording to the number of characters in the subword ytext\ni\nand adds character-level embeddings. With\nytext-char, the character-length sequence corresponding to ytext, we compute the character-length representations\nhchar as follows:\ndchar\ni\n= f char\ndur (ytext\ni\n, ytext-char),\n(9)\nj =\nX\nl<i\ndchar\nl\n+ m (m = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , dchar\ni\n),\n(10)\nhchar\nj\n= Sub2Char(hi, ytext-char\nj\n, j)\n= hi + Echar(ytext-char\nj\n) +\n1\n\u221admodel\n\u00b7 Poschar(j),\n(11)\nwhere f char\ndur is a function returning the number of characters (dchar\ni\n) in the i-th subword, Echar is a character\nembedding lookup table, Poschar is a character-level positional embedding layer, and dmodel is the model\ndimension.\n5Subword vocabulary size of 256K in SeamlessM4T\n18\nThen, a character-to-unit upsampler Char2Unit further upsamples hchar to unit-length representations hunit\nas:\ndunit\nj\n= f unit\ndur (ytext-char\nj\n, udup, Ahard; \u03b8dur),\n(12)\nk =\nX\nl<j\ndunit\nl\n+ m (m = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , dunit\nj\n),\n(13)\nhunit\nk\n= Char2Unit(hchar\nj\n, k) = hchar\nj\n+ \u03b1 \u00b7 Posunit(k),\n(14)\nwhere f unit\ndur is a duration predictor (parameterized by \u03b8dur) that returns the number of duplicated units (dunit\nj\n)\naligned with the j-th character, Ahard is a hard character-to-unit alignment matrix, \u03b1 is a learnable scale\nparameter, and Posunit is a unit-level positional embedding layer. hunit is used as input to the NAR unit\ndecoder. The duration predictor f unit\ndur in Equation (12) is trained to optimize Ldur(\u03b8dur), a mean square error\n(MSE) loss taking the duration predicted by the aligner as training target in the logarithmic domain.\n3.3.2 Unsupervised multilingual character-to-unit alignment learning\nFor upsampling, the NAR unit decoder requires alignment (Ahard) between characters and units to train the\nunit duration predictor f unit\ndur . The original FastSpeech2 used a forced alignment tool (e.g., Montreal Forced\nAligner (McAuliffe et al., 2017)) to supervise the duration predictor. For our massively multilingual efforts,\nforced aligners are unavailable for many low-resource languages. To circumvent the need for external aligners,\nwe propose an unsupervised multilingual character-to-unit aligner. We adapted the aligner architecture in\nRAD-TTS (Shih et al., 2021) to our use case. Namely, the SeamlessM4T v2 multilingual char-to-unit\naligner is (1) modified to take discrete units and characters as inputs, (2) trained in a multilingual fashion on\n35 languages, and (3) trained with curriculum learning for the alignment prior.\nFor a character-length sequence ytext-char and the associated unit sequence udup, let schar and sunit be the\noutputs of the aligner\u2019s two encoders (one for characters and one for units). A soft alignment Asoft is calculated\nas follows:\nDi,j = ||schar\ni\n\u2212sunit\nj\n||2,\n(15)\nAsoft\ni,j =\ne\u2212Di,j\nP\nk e\u2212Dk,j + Pprior(i|j),\n(16)\nwhere Pprior is the Beta-binomial alignment prior to encourage near-diagonal paths (Shih et al., 2021). We\ndisabled this alignment prior after 8k training steps to let the aligner learn a more accurate alignment\nlater in the training. To extract a hard alignment Ahard from Asoft, the monotonic alignment search (MAS)\nalgorithm (Kim et al., 2020) is applied.\nTo optimize the aligner parameters \u03b8align, we maximized the log-likelihood of all possible monotonic alignment\npaths S(ytext-char), based on the forward algorithm. The forward sum loss Lfwd is formulated as:\nLfwd(\u03b8align) = \u2212log P\n\u0000S(ytext-char)|udup; \u03b8align\n\u0001\n,\n= \u2212log\nX\na\u2208S(ytext-char)\n|udup|\nY\nj=1\nP(aj|udup\nj\n; \u03b8align),\n(17)\nwhere the marginalization is efficiently implemented using a CTC loss. To enforce that Asoft matches Ahard,\na binarization loss Lbin = Ahard \u2299log Asoft with \u2299the Hadamard product. This term is simply the KL\ndivergence between the two alignments. Lbin is added after Kbin training steps.\n3.3.3 Efficient span-based glancing training for NAR unit generation\nNon-autoregressive sequence generation suffers from the multimodality problem.6\nPrevious works have\naddressed this problem by using iterative decoding (Lee et al., 2018), powerful generative models like\n6Each token\u2019s distribution depends only on the source sentence; this conditional independence assumption prevents a model\nfrom properly capturing the highly multimodal distribution of target translations (Gu et al., 2017a).\n19\nnormalizing flows (Ma et al., 2019b), or diffusion-based models (Gong et al., 2023b; Reid et al., 2022). In this\nwork, we used a single-step NAR decoder to maintain inference efficiency. Particularly, UnitY2\u2019s NAR T2U\ndecoder is a Glancing Transformer (GLAT) (Qian et al., 2021) that relaxes NAR token prediction by glancing\nat the ground-truth tokens. When the naive GLAT based on random masking is used for unit prediction,\nthe task becomes trivial since adjacent units are locally correlated. To adapt GLAT to unit prediction, we\npropose an efficient span-based GLAT that operates on the character length before glancing at the units.\nGiven a unit prediction accuracy \u03b1, we sampled character positions to mask with a probability 1 \u2212\u03b1. With\nIchar the set of the sampled positions to be masked in ytext-char, we obtained the corresponding unit positions\nIunit following the aligner\u2019s Ahard. We then replaced the decoder input in the Iunit positions with ground-truth\nunit embeddings. We demonstrate that the proposed span-based masking is more effective than random\nmasking at the unit level. Furthermore, we propose an efficient training based on a single forward pass where\n\u03b1 is estimated from the previous Kglat steps, instead of introducing a duplicate forward pass at each training\nstep.\n3.3.4 Training UnitY2\u2019s NAR T2U and aligner\nThe second-pass NAR unit decoder and aligner are jointly trained with the following objective:\nLnar(\u03b8T 2U, \u03b8dur, \u03b8align) = Lce(\u03b8T 2U) + Ldur(\u03b8dur) + Linterctc(\u03b8T 2U)\n+ Lfwd(\u03b8align) + Lbin(\u03b8align),\n(18)\nwhere Linterctc is a character-level CTC loss at an intermediate unit decoder layer, added to accelerate training\nconvergence (Lee and Watanabe, 2021).\n3.4 S2ST Training Setup.\nFollowing S2ST and T2U modeling in SeamlessM4T, we trained two NAR T2U models for different purposes:\na teacher T2U model used for unit pseudo-labeling (Section 3.1.2) and a student T2U model used for initializing\nthe T2U sub-component in UnitY2 and finetuning on S2ST data. Both T2U models are based on the NAR\ndecoder architecture (Section 3.3).\nTeacher T2U pre-training.\nSince discrete unit sequences are much longer than subword sequences, we\noccasionally observed hallucination during unit pseudo-labeling with an auto-regressive model. NAR models,\non the other hand, rarely hallucinate because duration modeling is decoupled from sequence generation.\nThe SeamlessM4T v2 teacher NAR T2U model takes characters as inputs and forgoes the subword-to-\ncharacter upsampling; it takes ground-truth text for input as opposed to a text decoder output (Section 3.3.1).\nThe teacher T2U consists of 12 encoder and 12 decoder layers.\nStudent T2U pre-training.\nThe student NAR T2U takes subwords as inputs and consists of six encoder and\nsix decoder layers. The decoder architecture is exactly the same as the unit decoder in UnitY2.\nFinetuning multitask-UnitY2.\nIn the third finetuning stage of SeamlessM4T v2, the multitask-UnitY2\nmodel is initialized with the pre-trained X2T and the student NAR T2U models described above. The X2T\nmodel is frozen, and only weights corresponding to the T2U model are updated during this finetuning stage.\nThe model is finetuned on a combination of pseudo-labeled and aligned X\u2013eng and eng\u2013X S2ST data totaling\n145K hours (see Table 64).\nThe new NAR T2U architecture with the pre-trained alignment module between text and units led to superior\nperformance and faster convergence. Given that all components are pre-trained on related tasks (S2TT, ASR,\nand T2U), the model converges after less than an epoch.\nMultilingual HiFi-GAN unit vocoder.\nUnlike SeamlessM4T, which uses the multitask-UnitY architecture,\nSeamlessM4T v2 predicts duplicated (non-reduced) units. As such, we re-trained the unit-based HiFi-GAN\nvocoder from SeamlessM4T (Seamless Communication et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023a) on ASR data to\nconvert the duplicated units to waveform without performing duration prediction.\n20\nS2TT\nFleurs\n(\u2191BLEU)\nS2ST\nFleurs\n(\u2191ASR-BLEU)\nS2ST\nCVSS\n(\u2191ASR-BLEU)\nModel\nsize\nX\u2013eng\n(n=81)\neng\u2013X\n(n=88)\nX\u2013eng\n(n=81)\neng\u2013X\n(n=26)\nX\u2013eng\n(n=21)\nWL-v2 (S2TT)\n1.5B\n17.9\n\u2013\n17.8\n\u2013\n29.6\nWL-v3 (S2TT)\n1.5B\n16.98\n\u2013\nA8B (S2TT)\n8B\n19.7\n\u2013\nWM (ASR) + NLLB-1.3B\n2B\n19.7\n20.7\n20.7\n21.5\nWM (ASR) + NLLB-3.3B\n4B\n20.4\n22.0\n21.4\n22.4\nWL-v2 (ASR) + NLLB-1.3B\n2.8B\n22.0\n21.2\n22.9\n21.8\nWL-v2 (ASR) + NLLB-3.3B\n4.8B\n22.7\n22.4\n23.7\n22.7\nSeamlessM4T-Medium\n1.2B\n20.9\n19.4\n20.2\n15.8\n30.6\nSeamlessM4T-Large\n2.3B\n24.1\n21.8\n25.8\n20.9\n35.7\nSeamlessM4T v2\n2.3B\n26.6\n22.2\n29.7\n26.1\n39.2\nTable 6 - State-of-the-art S2TT/S2ST models.

We abbreviate Whisper-Large as WL, Whisper-Medium as WM and\nAudioPaLM-2-8B-AST as A8B.\n3.5 Results and Discussion\nIn this section, we trained SeamlessM4T-Large v2, a 2.3B model in the multitask-UnitY2 architecture\nwith the same coverage (i.e., tasks and languages) as SeamlessM4T (Seamless Communication et al., 2023).\nA card for this model is available in Appendix B.\nWe evaluated SeamlessM4T-Large v2 on all four supervised tasks (T2TT, ASR, S2TT, and S2ST), as\nwell as the zero-shot task of text-to-speech translation (T2ST, also referred to as cross-lingual text-to-speech\nsynthesis (Zhang et al., 2023b)).\nTo generate text hypotheses, we decoded with beam-search (width=5). We scored T2TT with chrF2++ and\nS2TT with SacreBLEU [default 13a tokenizer and character-level tokenizer for Mandarin Chinese (cmn),\nJapanese (jpn), Thai (tha), Lao (lao), and Burmese (mya)]. For ASR, following Radford et al. (2022), we scored\nnormalized transcriptions and references with WER (word error rate). See metric details in Appendix H.\nDuring S2ST and T2ST inference, we performed two-pass beam-search decoding\u2014the best hypothesis out\nof the first-pass decoding is embedded with the text decoder and is sent to T2U to search for the best unit\nsequence hypothesis. We used a beam-width of 5 for both searches. We evaluated S2ST and T2ST accuracy\nwith ASR-BLEU (Lee et al., 2022a) with Whisper-Large as the underlying ASR model.7 We set the\ndecoding temperature of Whisper at zero and used greedy decoding to ensure a deterministic behavior of the\nASR model. The transcribed hypotheses, as well as the references, are normalized following (Radford et al.,\n2022) before computing BLEU scores (with the tokenization described for S2TT). In the following, we report\naverages for the per-language scores across all the evaluated tasks (see Appendix I.3).\nComparison to SeamlessM4T and cascaded models.\nOn the set of languages supported by both Seam-\nlessM4T/SeamlessM4T v2 and the baselines included as a reference, we compare in Table 6 the performance\nof our unified and direct model to that of the first version of SeamlessM4T, as well as cascaded models.\nFor S2TT, the cascaded models comprise Whisper ASR models and NLLB T2TT models. For S2ST, two\noptions were considered for cascading: (1) 3-stage with ASR, T2TT, and TTS and (2) 2-stage with S2TT and\n7This is different from Seamless Communication et al. (2023), where Whisper-Large-v2 was used for eng\u2013X directions and\nWhisper-Medium was used for X\u2013eng directions. We re-evaluated SeamlessM4T models here with Whisper-Large for a\ndirect comparison.\n8We evaluated Whisper-Large-v3 on S2TT Fleurs X\u2013eng using https://github.com/openai/whisper/. For Whisper-\nLarge-v2, we used the results from Radford et al.

Performance of SeamlessM4T-Large on X2T tasks (S2TT, ASR and T2TT)\ncompared to SOTA direct translation models. For MT, we average chrF scores over the supported written languages\nin SeamlessM4T (n=96). For Fleurs ASR, we report the average normalized WER over languages supported by\nboth SeamlessM4T and Whisper Large (WL) (Fleurs-77). For MMS, we report the results of the\nMMS-L1107-CCLM-LSAH model (CTC-based with an n-gram language model for each language) on Fleurs-54. For\na direct comparison with Whisper-Large-v3, we average over whisper\u2019s reported WER scores on Fleurs-60. To\ncompare all ASR models on a common benchmark, we included averages over Fleurs-41.\nTTS. We used YourTTS for English-TTS (Casanova et al., 2022) and MMS\u2019s TTS models for non-English9\nTTS (Pratap et al., 2023).\nIn Fleurs, SeamlessM4T v2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in S2TT, improving in X\u2013eng by 10%\nover SeamlessM4T-Large, and by more than 17% over the strongest cascaded model (Whisper-Large-v2\n+ NLLB-3.3B). When compared against direct models (e.g., Whisper and AudioPaLM), SeamlessM4T v2\nsignificantly outperformed both in X\u2013eng directions by more than 35%.10\nIn speech-to-speech translation, SeamlessM4T v2 improves over SeamlessM4T-Large in Fleurs by more\nthan 15% in X\u2013eng and 25% in eng\u2013X. Compared to the strongest cascaded models, this is an improvement\nof 25% and 15% in X\u2013eng and eng\u2013X, respectively. Results on CVSS show a similar trend and a consistently\nstrong performance with generalizability to other domains.\nMulitasking results.\nWe compare in Table 7 the performance of SeamlessM4T v2 to that of state-of-the-art\nmodels in T2TT and ASR tasks. Evaluated for Fleurs ASR, on the overlapping 77 languages between\nWhisper-Large-v2 and SeamlessM4T, SeamlessM4T-Large v2 improved over SeamlessM4T-Large\nby a relative -21% WER and over Whisper-Large-v2 by a relative -56% WER. For comparison against MMS,\nwe also report the average on Fleurs-54, where SeamlessM4T-Large v2 improves over SeamlessM4T-\nLarge by a relative -19% WER, closing the gap with MMS\u2019s best model (MMS-L61-noLM-LSAH) to -0.4\nWER.

Its T2TT accuracy is still, however, on par\nwith the equally-sized NLLB-1.3B for X\u2013eng and NLLB-3.3B for eng\u2013X.\nEvaluated on CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2021), a multilingual S2TT benchmark dataset, SeamlessM4T-Large\nv2 improved over SeamlessM4T-Large by +2.5 BLEU in X\u2013eng directions and by +1.1 in eng\u2013X directions.\nIn X\u2013eng directions SeamlessM4T still lags behind AudioPaLM-2-8B-AST (-1.2 BLEU).\nZero-shot text-to-speech translation.\nWe next evaluated SeamlessM4T-Large v2 on the task of T2ST\nin a zero-shot way. Given that Fleurs collected three recordings by three different native speakers for\neach sample, we randomly select one for the task of T2ST (the input being text). We report in Table 8 a\ncomparison between SeamlessM4T models and cascaded models with NLLB and either YourTTS (English\nTTS) or MMS (non-English TTS) for synthesizing translated text. We averaged ASR-BLEU scores over 88\nX\u2013eng directions (the overlap between Fleurs and the languages supported by SeamlessM4T v2). We also\naveraged ASR-BLEU over 26 eng\u2013X directions (the overlap between our 35 and the languages supported by\nMMS\u2019s TTS models). SeamlessM4T-Large v2 improved by a large margin over SeamlessM4T-Large\n(+1.8 and +5.8 ASR-BLEU points in X\u2013eng and eng\u2013X respectively). Compared to cascaded models,\nSeamlessM4T-Large v2\u2019s zero-shot capability is on par with NLLB-3.3B + YourTTS in X\u2013eng, and\noutperforms NLLB-3.3B + MMS by more than +3.9 ASR-BLEU points in eng\u2013X.\nResults by resource-level.\nWe show in Table 9 the improvements in Fleurs S2TT X\u2013eng, S2ST X\u2013eng\nand ASR achieved in SeamlessM4T-Large v2 when buttressed with additional supervised data (mostly\nautomatically aligned) and unlabeled data used to train our w2v-BERT 2.0 speech encoder. Our efforts\nto increase supervised and self-supervised data targeted low- and medium-resource languages.\nOverall,\nSeamlessM4T-Large v2 improved on low-resource languages by an average of 2.8 BLEU points, 4.3\nASR-BLEU points and -7.5 WER in the three tasks respectively. As for medium-resource languages, it\nimproved by an average of 3.0 BLEU points, 4.5 ASR-BLEU points and -4.7 WER respectively.\nAblation on the input representations for T2U.\nWe investigated better input and output representations\nfor both AR and NAR T2U models. To do so, we compared subword and character as input with reduced and\nnon-reduced units as output in Table 10a. We found that the previous setting with subword input and reduced\n23\nunit was the best for the AR T2U model, while character input and non-reduced unit were the best for the\nNAR T2U model. The best NAR T2U model outperformed the best AR T2U model by 35% in ASR-WER.\nModel\nText input\ntokenization\nOutput units\ndeduplication\n\u2193ASR-WER\n(n=32)\nAR T2U\nSubword\nReduced\n20.79\nSubword\nNon-reduced\n24.78\nCharacter\nReduced\n35.49\nCharacter\nNon-reduced\n78.35\nNAR T2U\nSubword\nReduced\n16.66\nSubword\nNon-reduced\n16.54\nCharacter\nReduced\n13.91\nCharacter\nNon-reduced\n13.41\n(a)\nA comparison of input and output representations in\nteacher T2U modeling.\nModel\n\u2193ASR-WER\n(n=32)\nNAR T2U\n13.41\nw/o GLAT\n14.97\nw/o Span-based masking\n15.17\nw/o Efficient GLAT\n13.54\nw/o InterCTC\n13.92\n(b)\nAblation studies in character-level teacher\nNAR T2U modeling.\nTable 10 - Ablation studies in T2U modeling.

We confirmed that GLAT significantly improved intelligibility and both span-based\nmasking and character-level InterCTC also contributed to further improvement. Efficient GLAT did not\ndegrade ASR-WER despite a single forward pass.\nUnitY2\u2019s multilingual char-to-unit aligner.\nThe UnitY2-based aligner component, used as a duration\nteacher in the T2U training, presents itself as a universal tool to align arbitrary text-audio pairs for any\ndownstream task. The presence of extremely large, unlabeled audio corpora makes this tool very attractive\nfor pseudo-labeling. We release a multilingual aligner component that supports all 36 target languages of\nSeamlessM4T v2, together with a front end for alignment extraction. The front end uses a character-based\nSentence-piece model to tokenize a raw text sequence and a 10K acoustic unit extractor, which outputs a\ndiscrete unit sequence from SeamlessM4T v2\u2019s unit space. We found that our aligner also works pretty well\nwhen using a normalized text.

SeamlessExpressive\nProsody contains rich paralinguistics functions in human communication, such as portraying a speaker\u2019s\nemotional state, attitude, and intent. How a speaker says an utterance can dramatically alter its meaning\n(holding semantic content constant). For instance, humans leverage variations in pitch (high or low), loudness\n(strong or soft), and duration (fast or slow) to express themselves in different situations.\nIn this section, we describe how we built SeamlessExpressive, a model that captures certain underexplored\naspects of prosody, such as speech rate and pauses, while preserving the style of one\u2019s voice and high content\ntranslation quality. More specifically, we developed SeamlessExpressive with the following techniques: 1) we\nleveraged SeamlessM4T v2 as a foundational model to achieve high accuracy in translation quality from a\nsemantics standpoint, 2) we proposed Prosody UnitY2, integrating an expressivity encoder in SeamlessM4T\nv2 to guide unit generation with proper rhythm, speaking rate and pauses, and 3) we replaced the unit\nHiFi-GAN vocoder in SeamlessM4T v2 with PRETSSEL, an expressive unit-to-speech generator conditioned\non the source speech for waveform generation to transfer tones, emotional expression, and vocal style.\nSeamlessExpressive, which preserves not only sentence-level rhythm and tone but also token-level prosody\nsuch as pauses, required prosody-aligned parallel speech data for Prosody UnitY2 training. As a re-\nsult, we describe our effort to collect hours of prosody-aligned parallel speech data in six high-resource\nlanguages\u2014English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish.\n4.1 Expressive Speech-to-Speech Translation Data\nIn this section, we introduce our efforts on collecting prosody-aligned parallel speech through data commis-\nsioning, automatic alignment, and synthesizing. Commissioned data, including mExpresso and mDRAL, are\nwell-aligned in emotions but limited in data size and diversity. We explore large-scale expressive aligned\ndata\u2014finding expressivity preserving cross-lingual alignments between speech segments from corpora. Finally,\nsynthetic data is part of our data augmentation strategy with Sonar, controllable TTS (cTTS), and Unit\nVoicebox, which contributed a large amount of aligned expressive speech.\n4.1.1 mExpresso\nThe Expresso corpus (Nguyen et al., 2023) is an English expressive speech dataset that includes both\nexpressively rendered read speech (comprising eight styles) and improvised dialogues. We created mExpresso,\na multilingual version of Expresso, by expanding six styles of read speech (i.e., default, happy, sad, confused,\nenunciated, and whisper) to five other languages\u2014French, German, Italian, Mandarin and Spanish.\nTo expand the Expresso dataset, bilingual translators first translated the English transcriptions into other\nlanguages, including the emphasis markers in the transcription. Second, a different set of gender-matched\nbilingual speakers (native in the target languages) read the translation in the style suggested by the markers.\nThe speakers had access to the original English recordings to learn how a sentence was uttered initially. To\ncontrol the quality of the recording, a different set of bilingual reviewers reviewed each recording to check the\nexpressiveness preservation and recording quality, and the speakers re-recorded utterances until all recordings\npassed the quality check.\n4.1.2 mDRAL\nDialogues Re-enacted Across Languages (DRAL) Corpus, proposed in Ward et al. (2023), is a bilingual speech\ncorpus of parallel utterances in Spanish and English created by recording spontaneous conversations and\nfragments re-enacted by bilingual speakers in a different language. More specifically, during a recording,\ntwo speakers were instructed to carry out unscripted conversations. The moderator then selects \u201cinteresting\u201d\nfragments, which are utterances that elicited more active engagement between the speakers and guided the\nspeakers to re-enact.\nWe followed the data collection protocols described in Ward et al. (2023), expanded the collection to native\nspeakers of French, German, Italian, Mandarin, or Spanish who are proficient in English, and created the\nmultilingual DRAL corpus dubbed mDRAL (see Appendix N for an overview of the collection protocol).\n25\nUnlike the original DRAL collection, we performed the collection remotely with the moderator and the two\nspeakers meeting over Zoom. One challenge in scaling up the data collection effort is the throughput\u2014the\nnumber of meaningful speech segments we can acquire from each conversation. We provided the speakers\nwith 32 emotion categories found in EmpatheticDialogues (Rashkin et al., 2019) as topic prompts to increase\ndata collection efficiency. Compared to mExpresso, mDRAL has less exaggerated and performed emotions,\nwhile the prosody is more natural.\n4.1.3 Automatically extracting expressive audio alignments\nSpeech-to-speech pairs that are automatically aligned based on semantics (like SeamlessAlign), do not\nalways contain the same expressive characteristics. While a simple filtering approach based on heuristics\ncould be devised, the volume of the resulting dataset would likely be drastically reduced as no explicit\nprosody-preservation goal was enforced to begin with (i.e., data would be expressively aligned by chance).\nInstead, we chose to modify the algorithm of SeamlessAlign to not only seek alignments based on semantic\npreservation but also to incorporate prosodic similarity.\nThe core algorithm behind SeamlessAlign relies on the computation of a semantic-based margin score (see\nSection 3.1). We supplement that semantic score with the result of an auxiliary model capable of determining\nprosodic similarity. Based on these two components, we introduce a new weighted scoring function defined as:\nblended-score(x, y) = \u03b1 \u00b7 margin + (1 \u2212\u03b1) \u00b7 prosody-score.\n(19)\nGiven the above formulation, an overview of the expressive audio alignment is shown in Figure 5. We began\nwith the same process as SeamlessAlign by semantically retrieving the k-nearest neighbors in a multilingual\nembedding space. Then, instead of choosing a neighbor with the best margin (i.e., semantic score), we applied\na prosodic-based auxiliary model to each neighbor and chose a candidate with the highest blended score as\ndefined in Equation (19).\nFigure 5 - Expressive audio alignment process. Similar to SeamlessAlign, audio was first language-identified and\nover-segmented, and then the resulting segments were embedded into a multilingual embedding space. k-nearest\nneighbor candidates were then retrieved based on the semantic-based margin and subsequently re-ranked with the\nblended score, resulting in expressively- and semantically-aligned pairs.\nIn order to tune the \u03b1 hyperparameter in the blended score, which controls the trade-off between semantic\naccuracy and prosody preservation, we introduce a new proxy metric for expressive audio alignment: p-xsim.\nThis new benchmark builds upon xsim, introduced in NLLB Team et al. (2022). Unlike xsim, where the goal\nis to reconstruct a dataset through semantic-only audio alignment and measure the percentage of incorrect\nalignments, p-xsim instead applies the same re-ranking as described in Equation (19) and aims to reconstruct\na dataset both semantically and expressively. We applied p-xsim to the mExpresso dataset (see Section 4.1.1).\nOur choice was driven by a need for variety. For one, mExpresso contains sentences repeated multiple times\nwith varying prosody. This makes it a challenging dataset for expressive audio alignments, as multiple\ncandidates with identical semantics will be retrieved during the k-nearest neighbor search. On the contrary, a\n26\nprosody-aligned dataset with no repetition would offer no such challenge, as alignments could be recovered\nbased on semantic features only.\nResults from p-xsim on the mExpresso benchmark dataset are shown in Table 11. We tuned \u03b1 using a grid\nsearch. To help our explorations, we also collapsed the mExpresso classes into three coarse emotion labels\nsimilar to Parry et al. (2019): positive (happy, laughing), negative (sad, confused), and neutral (default,\nwhisper, enunciated). As a baseline, we used the margin score only and then tried several auxiliary models\nfor the prosody score, namely AutoPCP12 (Section 7.1), and different embedding layers extracted from\nw2v-BERT. Adding a prosody-aware component to the audio alignment scoring function clearly boosted\nperformance, and AutoPCP provided significantly higher quality alignments than representations from\nw2v-BERT.\nOpt. param.\n\u03b1\n\u2193p-xsim\nall emotions\npos/neg/neu\nsemantic-only baseline\n-\n84.86\n60.57\nw2v-BERT - layer 23\n0.2\n84.79\n60.27\nw2v-BERT - layer 20\n0.1\n54.40\n36.04\nAutoPCP\n0.1\n47.06\n28.90\nTable 11 - Performance of p-xsim. Error rate when recreating gold alignments of various prosody-aware auxiliary\nscorers on the Spanish\u0001English mExpresso test set.\nOnce the \u03b1 parameter was optimized using p-xsim, we ran expressive S2ST audio alignment at scale on a\ncurated selection of publicly available data in our target languages. The resulting alignments were used to\nsupplement the final training data for SeamlessExpressive.\nSeamlessAlignExpressive\nSeparate to the data used to train SeamlessExpressive, we apply this expressive\nalignment method at scale on a different publicly available corpus. The total number of hours collected can be\nfound in Table 16. We release the metadata of this data set to the community as SeamlessAlignExpressive\nto foster future research in expressive speech-to-speech translation as well as to validate the effectiveness of\nour expressive alignment method.\nUpon manual inspection, we identified several emerging properties when several semantically viable candidates\nwere available:\n\u2022 expressive audio alignment seems to remove candidates with mismatched background music,\n\u2022 emotion/intonation imbalance is highly reduced, and\n\u2022 segments with singing are also much less common in final alignments.\nWhile further analysis of those properties was out of the scope of this study, we hypothesized that expressive\naudio alignment could also have a net-positive effect on non-expressive speech translation, as it produced\nmuch cleaner alignments overall.\n4.1.4 Extracting parallel segments from videos\nWe also processed videos in multiple languages to extract bilingual expressive segments. This process is\ndifferent from the standard audio alignment approach described in Section 3.1 because the audio data is\nalmost parallel in this case. The task is then to segment and monotonically align the multilingual audio\ncontent.\nThe process was performed as follows: the audio was extracted from the video, segmented, and transcribed\nwith Whisper (Radford et al., 2022). One issue we faced is that the segmentation provided by Whisper is\noften inconsistent across languages. Therefore, the segments cannot be matched directly, leading to a low\n12For expressive audio alignment, we used an earlier version of the AutoPCP model. It has the same architecture as the\nmodel we used for evaluation and it uses embeddings from a different layer of the XSL-R speech encoder.\n27\nrecall. To solve this issue, we took advantage of the word boundaries provided by Whisper and adopted a\nsplit-merge approach, which consists of first splitting the current segments based on the pauses (available by\nanalyzing the transcriptions) and then concatenating them back together to form new overlapping segments.\nSegments longer than 25 seconds and segments having pauses longer than 1.5 seconds were excluded. Then,\nthe speech segments and their transcriptions were each encoded separately with our encoders to produce two\nembeddings per segment. The next step was to align the segments. If they were disjointed, we could use a\nsimple monotonic alignment algorithm. Yet, if not the case, finding an optimal solution would be intractable\ndue to the large number of alignments to consider. Therefore, we used a greedy algorithm that matched\nbilingual segments having the highest overall score, removed all overlapping segments from the pool, and\nrepeated the process until the candidate pool was empty. Each segment pair candidate was associated with a\nscore corresponding to an average of the cosine similarities of both the text and speech embeddings. This score\nwas modified according to an estimation of the lag (i.e., the time gap between the centers of both segments).\nFinally, all matching candidates were filtered based on predefined rules (defined by manually inspecting the\ndata), such as similarity threshold, duration mismatch, and time gap. Table 12 shows the statistics of the\nresulting aligned data.\nLanguage\nTotal hours\n# segments\nAvg. segment\nduration (s)\nEnglish\nLang.\nEnglish\nLang.\nFrench\n300.7\n299.1\n499.0k\n2.17\n2.16\nGerman\n118.8\n121.8\n224.2k\n1.91\n1.96\nItalian\n69.3\n68.1\n122.4k\n2.04\n2.00\nMandarin\n254.9\n286.1\n268.5k\n3.42\n3.84\nSpanish\n242.6\n237.9\n363.4k\n2.40\n2.36\nTable 12 - Statistics of aligned audio data. The total duration and average segment length per language are reported\nfor data obtained from aligning multilingual videos.\n4.1.5 SONAR expressive\nSONAR is a multilingual and multimodal fixed-sized sentence embedding space introduced by Duquenne\net al. (2023b). The modalities cover both text and speech representations. However, this space is primarily\ngrounded in text as it was tuned on speech-to-text and text-to-text datasets. Given this grounding in text,\nthe space is centered on semantics, so the existing Sonar space is not explicitly tuned to encode anything\nother than semantics from the input text or speech. Sonar Expressive (Duquenne et al., 2023a) extends\nthe capabilities of this space to also include representations for prosodic characteristics.\nAn overview of the architecture of Sonar Expressive is shown in Figure 6. It comprises two encoders: a\nfrozen Sonar text/speech encoder to capture semantics (Sonar embedding) and a trainable speech encoder\nthat captures speech properties other than semantics (SpeechProp embedding). Then, given a combination\nof both the SpeechProp vector (i.e., prosody, etc.) and the semantic vector, the objective is to reconstruct\nthe input speech, represented using EnCodec units (D\u00b4efossez et al., 2022).\nGiven that Sonar Expressive has the ability to expressively decode input speech, we leveraged this\nas another data source for model training. We began with unaligned speech segments, applied the same\npre-processing as used for Sonar Expressive model pre-training (Duquenne et al., 2023b), and randomly\nsampled segments from each non-English language (French, German, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish). As we\nobserved that semantic preservation for the Sonar semantic encoder was higher given an English text-based\ninput (Duquenne et al., 2023b), segments from each non-English language were translated into English text\nusing the Sonar encoders/decoders. Each non-English speech segment and English text translation were\nthen expressively decoded into English. An overview of the decoded data is shown in Table 13.\n4.1.6 Controllable TTS (cTTS) data augmentation\nOne limitation of automatically aligned expressive data is that the prosody of the audio data may not be\nperfectly aligned between source and target speech (e.g., speech rate and pause location).

Therefore, we leveraged controllable TTS to synthesize more prosody-aligned speech-to-speech data.\nWe first sample English monolingual text to augment from. Then, we inserted one paired quote into each\nEnglish text and ran NLLB (NLLB Team et al., 2022) Dense-3.3B model for translating into all five languages\n(French, German, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish). Followed by further filtering on the translation output to\nensure only one paired quote exists, we randomly replaced the paired quote in the source and target text\nwith one of the three augmentation instructions: 1) no augmentation, 2) equal chance to insert the pause at\nthe first or second quote, with a randomly chosen pause duration between 0.3 and 1.5 seconds and the quote\nconverted to a special pause token. We used an internal controllable TTS system for all languages except\nMandarin Chinese. For Mandarin Chinese, we trained a VITS (Kim et al., 2021) model on 15-hour speech\ndata. We used these systems to synthesize speech with a random utterance-level speech-rate manipulation\nbetween 70% and 130%.\n4.1.7 Comparing across data sources\nTable 14 describes the characteristics of each dataset in four aspects: style, speaker diversity, expressiveness,\nand expressivity alignment. Spontaneous style indicates that the speech is more natural, while acted speech\nimplies that the speech can be more expressive yet less natural. The commissioned datasets have the lowest\nspeaker diversity because the data collection was expensive and time-consuming. While expressive alignment\ncan provide a large amount of parallel data, such speech pairs are mostly aligned in sentence-level styles due\nto the choice of prosody score. Further filtering can be done to refine the datasets to be better aligned in\nspeech rate and pauses. In theory, video alignment should generate speech pairs with the best expressivity\nalignment. However, we find that due to the constraint of time alignment in videos and the characteristics\nof different languages, speech for some languages may be much faster than others. Controllable TTS data\nprovides speech pairs that have the best alignment in speech rate and pauses, but the speech is monotonic\nand lacks sentence-level expressiveness such as emotions.\n29\nCommissioned\nAutomatically Aligned\nSynthetic\nmExpresso\nmDRAL\nExpressive\nAlignments\nVideo\nAlignments\nSonar\nExpressive\ncTTS\nStyle\nacted\nspontaneous\nspontaneous\nacted\nspontaneous and\nsynthetic pairs\nsynthetic\nSpeaker\ndiversity\nlow\nlow\nhigh\nmedium\nhigh\nlow\nExpressiveness\nhigh\nmedium\nmedium\nhigh\nmedium\nlow\nExpressivity alignment\nSentence-level\nstyle\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\nspeech rate\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2713\npause\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2713\nsame voice\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2713\nTable 14 - Datasets characteristics. We compare commissioned, automatically aligned, and synthetic data on style,\nspeaker diversity, expressiveness, and sentence-level prosody alignment.\n4.1.8 Training data pre-processing\nOnce data was collected, we then performed the following augmentations in order to form (source-target)\nspeaker-aligned, clean speech data with transcriptions: (1) denoising, (2) silence removal, (3) transcription,\nand (4) vocal style conversion. Since datasets come from various sources (with varying audio qualities), not\nall preprocessing steps described above must be applied to each. For example, cTTS has no background\nnoise, so no denoising was needed. We have a commissioned dataset with no background noise but with\nleading and trailing silence, so silence removal is required. Vocal style conversion was applied to all datasets\nexcept for Sonar Expressive since we observed such qualities were already mostly preserved. Since cTTS\nand commissioned datasets already had transcriptions available, no ASR was needed. An overview of which\npreprocessing steps were applied for each dataset is shown in Table 15, and an overview of the number of\nhours collected for each dataset is shown in Table 16.\nExpressive\nAlignments\nSonar\nExpressive\nVideo\nAlignments\nCommissioned\ncTTS\nDenoising\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2717\nSilence Removal\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\nVocal Style Conversion\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nTranscription\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2717\nTable 15 - Data pre-processing. pre-processing steps applied to each dataset.\nIn order to perform denoising we used the publicly available Demucs tool13 (Rouard et al., 2023). Leading\nand trailing silences were removed using Silero voice activity detection (Silero, 2021), and ASR was run\nusing Whisper14 (Radford et al., 2022). Denoising and silence removal were applied in sequence (i.e. once\ndata was denoised, the outputs were fed as input to the silence removal step). Additionally transcription,\nwhere applicable, was performed following silence removal since it is possible in rare cases that some verbal\nutterances may not be recognized by voice activity detection.\nVocal style conversion with Unit Voicebox.\nThe lack of speaker and prosody-aligned data is one challenge\nof translation modeling with expressivity. We created such aligned data with a unit-based Voicebox. Voicebox\nis a flow-matching model supporting preserving the style of one\u2019s voice via text-to-speech synthesis (Le et al.,\n2023). It takes prompt audio and phoneme sequence as input and then generates speech output with the\nspeaking style of the prompt and semantics of the phonemes. We propose Unit Voicebox, adapted from the\nphoneme-based Voicebox framework with the following changes:\n13https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs\n14Whisper-Large-v2 model\n30\nExpressive\nAlignments\nSonar\nExpressive\nVideo\nAlignments\nCommissioned\ncTTS\nFrench\n4,376\n1,784\n299\n0\n1,515\nGerman\n2,122\n1,865\n122\n17\n1,503\nItalian\n1,118\n1,891\n68\n18\n1,614\nMandarin\n116\n1,694\n286\n14\n1,402\nSpanish\n4,242\n1,841\n237\n31\n1,637\nTotal\n11,974\n9,075\n1,012\n80\n7,671\nTable 16 - Data statistics. Number of source hours per dataset.\n\u2022 Speech units. To remove the reliance on texts and phonemes, we replaced phonemes with discrete units\nas semantic representations of speech. These speech units have been used by SeamlessM4T v2, which\nare speech representations from XLS-R quantized with k-means clustering.\n\u2022 Language embedding. As we aimed to enable multilingual speech synthesis, integrating language\ninformation helps the model distinguish languages and generate more natural-sounding speech in various\nlanguages. We do this via language embedding. Specifically, each language was assigned a set of\nlearnable embeddings, and the language embeddings were concatenated with the unit embedding when\nthe semantic units were vectorized.\nUnit Voicebox was first pre-trained on large-scale multilingual speech corpora (c.f. Section 4.4) to learn\nprompt-based natural-sounding speech synthesis. To enable the model to better capture speaking styles, we\nfurther finetuned it on high-quality emotional speech.\nThe trained Unit Voicebox was applied to mExpresso, expressive, and video alignments to boost their\nprosody matching by explicitly converting paired utterances to the same vocal style. As for cTTS data aligned\nin pauses and speed but lacking in emotions, we applied Unit Voicebox to enhance emotional strength and\nvocal style variation in speech. We prepared multilingual emotional data as the style prompt and multi-speaker\nspeech as the speaker prompt. Unit Voicebox takes either style or speaker prompt and transfers its voice\nstyle to the aligned speech in the cTTS data. Some heuristics were adopted below to optimize the synthesized\nspeech quality when pairing prompt with cTTS data:\n\u2022 Speech rate matching. We measured the speech rate of prompt and cTTS speech by the number of\nsyllables per second, and they are paired when the speech rate difference is no larger than one.\n\u2022 Duration matching. As demonstrated in recent studies (Borsos et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a), it is\nharder to transfer the prompt\u2019s voice style to a long speech, and thus, a longer prompt is needed to\nprovide more acoustic information and improve the transfer quality. A prompt is paired with cTTS\nspeech when it is no less than one-third of the cTTS duration.\n\u2022 Mixing style and speaker prompts. Style prompts from multilingual emotional data are usually limited in\nquantity and further constrained by the number of speakers. To balance the style and speaker diversity\nin augmented speech, we set the ratio between style and speaker prompt to 0.8 (i.e., 80% of cTTS speech\nwere paired with style prompts, and the rest were paired with multi-speaker prompts).\n4.2 Expressive Modeling\nThe proposed SeamlessExpressive translation system, as illustrated in Figure 7, incorporates expressivity\nembedding in both the translation model and speech generator of the SeamlessM4T v2\u2019s design. This allows\nus to maintain high semantic translation quality given by the backbone system. In other words, we propose a\ncascaded expressive modeling pipeline that consists of two main sub-modules: (1) Prosody UnitY2, which\nis a prosody-aware speech-to-unit translation model based on UnitY2 architecture, and (2) PRETSSEL, a\nnovel textless acoustic model featuring cross-lingual expressivity preservation during unit-to-speech generation.\nProsody UnitY2 and PRETSSEL are designed to complement each other in transferring the expressiveness\nof source language speech. That means, Prosody UnitY2 aims to transfer phrase-level prosody such as\n31\nPROSODY UNITY2\nMel-Filterbanks extractor\n(bins=80)\nSpeech encoder\nText decoder\nExpressivity\nencoder\nNAR T2U\nPRETSSEL\ndeduplication\nTextless\nacoustic model\nconcat\nExpressivity\nencoder\nLanguage\nembedding\nHiFi-GAN\nMel-vocoder\nFigure 7 - Overview of SeamlessExpressive.

Then, we discuss\nhow both components are used together to give rise to expressive speech-to-speech translation.\n4.2.1 PRETSSEL: Expressive unit-to-speech generator\nFor the high-quality cross-lingual expressivity transfer, we propose a Paralinguistic REpresentation-based\nTextleSS acoustic modEL, or PRETSSEL. PRETSSEL can efficiently disentangle semantic and expressivity\ncomponents from source language speech through unsupervised speech reconstruction pretraining. The\noverall architecture of PRETSSEL and its pretraining process are illustrated in Figure 8. More specifically,\nPRETSSEL was pretrained to reconstruct 80-dimensional Mel-filterbank features of input speech from the\ndeduplicated (or reduced) XLS-R units with 10k k-means clustering and the same Mel-filterbank features.\nAfter pretraining, the model is capable of expressivity-preserving Mel-filterbank generation by taking a unit\nsequence in the target language and Mel-filterbank features in source speech as the expressive prompt. Lastly,\nthe HiFi-GAN vocoder (Kong et al., 2020) synthesizes speech waveform from the Mel-filterbank features.\nThe proposed PRETSSEL is composed of expressivity encoder that extracts expressivity embedding vector\nfrom the source language speech and the textless acoustic model that generates the Mel-filterbank features\nfrom expressivity embedding and the XLS-R units. We detail each module in the following subsections.\nExpressivity encoder.\nThe expressivity encoder extracts a 512-dimensional expressivity embedding vector\ncontaining high-level paralinguistic representations from the input 80-dimensional Mel-filterbank features. As a\nbackbone network, we adopted a modified version of the ECAPA-TDNN architecture. The choice of the model\narchitecture was motivated by its high performance in extracting speech\u2019s acoustic representation (Desplanques\net al., 2020). In our model, we replaced the batch normalization layer (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) with layer\nnormalization (Ba et al., 2016) for consistent performance at different batch sizes. Once expressivity embedding\nis extracted, we normalized it with the L2 norm to make the training process more stable.\nNote that the XLS-R units mainly contain linguistic information of speech (Seamless Communication et al.,\n2023). Thus, as mentioned by Skerry-Ryan et al. (2018), the information that expressivity embedding learns\nbecomes paralinguistic information, including prosody information and other acoustic properties such as the\nstyle of one\u2019s voice. As a result, when it comes to expressive S2ST, both prosody and vocal style characteristics\ncan be efficiently transferred to output speech by extracting expressivity embedding from source language\n32\nMel-Filterbanks\nextractor\n(bins=80)\nx(\u2113s)\nExpressivity\nencoder\nTEXTLESS ACOUSTIC MODEL\nSEAMLESSM4T V2\nunit extraction\n(udedup, ddedup)\nContent\nencoder\nLocal prosody\nencoder\nLanguage\nembedding\n\u2113s\nconcat\nGaussian\nupsampler\nMel decoder\nPostNet\nudedup\nddedup\n\u02c6x(\u2113s)\nMel-Filterbanks\nLlocal\nLmel\nLfilm\nF0/VUV/energy\nEstimated\nF0/VUV\nenergy\nFigure 8 - PRETSSEL pre-training.

We adopted a non-autoregressive (NAR) Transformer model\nderived from FastSpeech2 (Ren et al., 2021a), where the XLS-R units are used as a linguistic input instead of\ntext or phoneme sequence.\nSpecifically, the content encoder first extracts a high-level context representation from XLS-R units using a\npositional encoding layer followed by feed-forward Transformer (FFT) blocks. Then, expressivity encoder\npredicts unit-level local prosody features defined by F0 and energy contours and adds them to the context\nencoder output. The Gaussian upsampler proposed by Shen et al. (2020) is adopted to upsample the unit-\nlevel hidden sequence to the frame-level time scale using unit duration. Mel-decoder then generates the\nMel-filterbank features of output speech from an upsampled hidden sequence using a positional encoding\nlayer followed by FFT blocks. To predict more naturally generated Mel-filterbank features, we used PostNet,\nproposed by Shen et al. (2018), to compensate for the residual signal that the decoder\u2019s FFT blocks could not\ncapture.\nEven though the overall architecture is similar to FastSpeech2, there are clear differences. First, we actively\nused expressivity embedding and language embedding vectors during the Mel-filterbank generation process for\neffective language-dependent expressivity transfer. In particular, inspired by Za\u00a8\u0131di et al. (2022), we applied\nFiLM conditioning layer (Perez et al., 2018; Oreshkin et al., 2018) for conditioning prosody and language\n33\nembeddings to every FFT block output and local prosody predictor as:\nfilm(h, c) = (\u03b3 + 1) \u00b7 h + \u03b2,\n\u03b3 = f1(c) \u00b7 \u03b8\u03b3,\n(20)\n\u03b2 = f2(c) \u00b7 \u03b8\u03b2,\nwhere h, c are respectively the hidden representation and the corresponding conditional embedding; f1, f2 are\nlinear projections and \u03b8\u03b3, \u03b8\u03b2 are learnable scalar parameters. The intuition behind this parameterized layer is\nto adjust the conditional embedding vector given its value relative to the hidden representation at every time\nstep.\nSecond, instead of predicting the unit duration with the internal local prosody predictor (Ren et al., 2021a),\nwe used predicted duration from UnitY2 for its better unit sequence modeling. For a given unit duration\nobtained by UnitY2, we simply converted it to Mel-duration by scaling it by a factor of two, which is the\nratio between intervals of Mel-filterbank features (i.e., 10 ms) and unit extraction (i.e., 20 ms). Then, we used\na Gaussian upsampler (Shen et al., 2020) to upsample unit-scale features to match the Mel-scale features.\nUnlike the original Gaussian upsampler that predicts the standard deviation of the Gaussian component, we\nset it to a constant value T 2 = 10 for simplicity. As mentioned in Shen et al. (2020), this is more similar to\nthe single Gaussian soft monotonic attention compared to the length regulator of FastSpeech2 mimicking hard\nmonotonic attention. Thus, the upsampled hidden features show continuous transition at the unit boundary,\nwhich is more efficient for representing continuously varying target Mel-filterbank features.\nWe also propose to split the binary voiced/unvoiced (VUV) flag from the F0 contour and separately predict\nthem during the local prosody prediction process. After predicting continuous F0 contour and binary VUV\nflag, we combine them by simply masking F0 values at unvoiced regions to zero. By externally imposing\nVUV properties during the local prosody encoding process, the model can more distinctively represent VUV\nproperties in its output Mel-filterbank features.\nUnsupervised pretraining.\nDuring pretraining, expressivity encoder and textless acoustic model are jointly\ntrained to minimize three loss terms:\nLtotal = Lmel + \u03bbl \u00b7 Llocal + \u03bbf \u00b7 Lfilm,\n(21)\nwhere Lmel, Llocal, and Lfilm denote Mel-filterbank prediction loss, local prosody prediction loss, and L2\nregularization loss at the FiLM layer, respectively; \u03bbv and \u03bbv denote weight terms for Llocal and Lfilm that\nare set to be 1.0 and 0.001, respectively. Each term is formulated as follows:\nLmel = L1(\u02c6ybefore, y) + L2(\u02c6ybefore, y) + L1(\u02c6yafter, y) + L2(\u02c6yafter, y),\n(22)\nLlocal = L2(\u02c6p, p) + BCE(\u02c6u, u) + L2(\u02c6e, e),\n(23)\nLfilm =\nX\n\u03b8\u03b3,\u03b8\u03b2\n\u0000\u03b82\n\u03b3 + \u03b82\n\u03b2\n\u0001\n,\n(24)\nwhere L1(\u00b7, \u00b7), L2(\u00b7, \u00b7) and BCE(\u00b7, \u00b7) denote L1, L2, and binary cross-entropy losses, respectively; \u02c6y and y\ndenote predicted and reference Mel-filterbank features, respectively; before and after subscripts imply the\none before and after PostNet, respectively; p, e, and u denote log-scale pitch contour where its unvoiced\nregion is linearly interpolated, log-scale energy, and VUV flag, respectively. We involve Lfilm for better\ngeneralization performance of the textless acoustic model as reported in Oreshkin et al. (2018). Note that\neach loss term does not require any text transcriptions or human data annotations, and it is easily scalable to\nlarge-scale data and more language directions.\nRelationship to prior works.\nThe key difference of PRETSSEL-based expressive S2ST system compared to\nSeamlessM4T v2 is that it utilizes source language\u2019s expressivity embedding during the speech generation\nprocess. The unit-based HiFi-GAN for SeamlessM4T v2 reconstructs speech waveform from XLSR-R units\nand language embedding without any connection to expressivity information. Thus, it tends to produce\nmonotone speech in terms of vocal style and prosody. In contrast, the proposed PRETSSEL overcomes this\nlimitation by explicitly conditioning source language\u2019s expressivity embedding.\n34\nA work similar to PRETSSEL is the Prosody2Vec framework (Qu et al., 2022). It similarly proposed a\ntextless acoustic model based on Tacotron2 (Shen et al., 2018) by replacing phoneme input with HuBERT\nunits (Hsu et al., 2021). The major differences between our effort and Prosody2vec are: (1) we adopted\nNAR FastSpeech2-based acoustic model for fast inference, (2) we integrated this model into expressive S2ST\nsystem, and (3) we adopted XLS-R units for the easy language scalability.\nOn the other hand, the PolyVoice (Dong et al., 2023) also adopted a similar cascaded approach for\nexpressive S2ST by incorporating cascaded language models (LMs) at speech-to-unit translation and unit-\nto-speech generation modules. In particular, it uses hybrid AR and NAR LM to generate SoundStream\nunits (Zeghidour et al., 2022) at target language from the target language\u2019s HuBERT units and the source\nlanguage\u2019s SoundStream units. Despite its high-quality expressive translation, PRETSSEL has strong\nbenefits considering hybrid AR and NAR LM\u2019s lower inference speed. Even though Unit Voicebox described\nin Section 4.1.8 can be a good alternative as an NAR unit-to-speech generator, it still lags inference speed\ncompared with PRETSSEL because its architecture requires heavier model size. More analysis is included\nin Section 4.4.\n4.2.2 Prosody UnitY2: Expressive speech-to-unit translation model\nMel-Filterbanks\nextractor\n(bins=80)\nxspeech(\u2113s)\nConformer\nspeech encoder\nLength\nadaptor\nTransformer\ntext decoder\nytext(\u2113t)\nExpressivity\nencoder\nsubword-length\nT2U encoder\nsubword-to-character\nupsampler\nUnit duration\npredictor\ncharacter-to-unit\nupsampler\nNAR unit decoder\nudup(\u2113t)\nContinuous decoder output\nFigure 9 - Prosody UnitY2. Illustration of modules building on UnitY2.\nFor the expressive speech-to-unit translation, we propose a Prosody UnitY2, which incorporates PRETS-\nSEL\u2019s expressivity embedding during the unit generation process. As illustrated in Figure 9, the proposed\nProsody UnitY2 is based on UnitY2\u2019s architecture that takes Mel-filterbank features of source language\nspeech as input, and outputs 20-ms interval XLS-R 10K units of target language speech.\nProsody-aware NAR T2U architecture.\nTo better transfer expressivity information of source speech during\nthe unit generation process, Prosody UnitY2 injects expressivity embedding extracted by expressivity\nencoder from the source speech into various positions of NAR T2U component: (1) adding expressivity\nembedding to the output of subword-length T2U encoder, and (2) conditioning the unit duration predictor and\nNAR unit decoder on the transformed expressivity embedding by a FiLM layer, as described in Equation (20).\nComponents in UnitY2, such as the duration predictor and NAR unit decoder, are capable of word/phrase-\nlevel prosody modeling concerning pauses and speech rate. However, it remains a non-trivial task for UnitY2\nto preserve them because its T2U component does not predict units explicitly conditioned on acoustic\n35\nSet\ncmn\ndeu\neng\nfra\nita\nspa\nTraining\n12,771\n1,965\n44,571\n1,073\n247\n915\nValidation\n20\n14\n16\n10\n5\n10\nTable 17 - PRETSSEL data statistics. Duration in hours of PRETSSEL pretraining datasets per language.\ninformation from source speech. The proposed prosody-aware T2U component can effectively address this\nlimitation by integrating expressivity embedding into unit prediction.\nFine-tuning pretrained components.\nWe used the S2TT model described in Section 3.2.2 as the foundation\nmodel and deployed it to initialize the speech encoder and the first-pass text decoder of Prosody UnitY2.\nThe MAdaptor layer of the S2TT component of Prosody UnitY2 is initialized using the GeLU activation\nfunction (where the original model uses ReLU), allowing the model to avoid quick overfitting during finetuning.\nIn contrast to the training design of Section 3.4, we finetuned the parameters of the S2TT component so that\nthe text decoder is able to learn pause labels located in our text training data.\nIn addition, for efficient prosody-aware training, we initialized expressivity encoder from the parameters of\nthe pretrained PRETSSEL. Then, all model parameters, including S2TT and expressivity encoder, were\njointly trained to optimize conventional UnitY2 training criteria, as explained in Section 3.3.4.\n4.2.3 Expressive S2ST with SeamlessExpressive\nAs illustrated in Figure 7, we separately trained Prosody UnitY2 and PRETSSEL and constructed the\nproposed SeamlessExpressive by cascading the two components. During inference, Prosody UnitY2\ntranslates source speech into XLS-R units of target language conditioned by expressivity embedding. Given\nunit duration and reduced units, the textless acoustic model of PRETSSEL synthesizes the Mel-filterbank\nfeatures of target language speech from XLS-R units. Specifically, the concatenated vector of the source\nlanguage\u2019s expressivity embedding and the target language\u2019s language embedding are used as the conditional\nvector of the acoustic model. Finally, the HiFi-GAN vocoder (Kong et al., 2020) converts Mel-filterbank\nfeatures into the speech waveform.\n4.3 Experimental Setup\nPRETSSEL.\nTo train PRETSSEL, we extracted 80-dimensional Mel-filterbank features and 10K XLS-\nR units using the same methods as SeamlessM4T v2. Then, we applied zero-mean and unit-variance\nnormalization to input and output Mel-filterbank features to stabilize model training.\nTo extract F0 and VUV flag, we first extracted F0 in every 5 ms by using DIO algorithm (Morise et al., 2016).\nThen, we obtained VUV flag specifying non-zero values of F0, while obtaining continuous F0 contour by\nlinearly interpolating zero values. To extract energy, we extracted energy contour every 5 ms using a 35-ms\nHanning window. Using the duration of unit, all F0, VUV flag, and energy features were averaged to have a\nreduced unit-scale. Finally, we converted linear F0 and energy values into log-scale.\nAt the pretraining stage, we collected several multilingual datasets covering six languages described at Sec-\ntion 4.1. We summarize the data statistics in Table 17. To alleviate language imbalance in training data, we\napplied temperature-based resampling with the temperature set to 5. For better generalization of expressivity\nembedding, SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019) with frequency mask with a maximum width of 8 and time mask\nwith a maximum width of 10 was applied on the fly during training. The PRETSSEL model was trained by\n500k iteration using 16 V100 GPUs with a learning rate of 10\u22124.\nWe randomly sampled 10k utterances from each language of PRETSSEL training data. and trained a\nHiFi-GAN model (Kong et al., 2020) for one million iterations with a fixed batch size of 16, batch length of\n8,960, and 8 V100 GPUs. We modified the original HiFi-GAN\u2019s upsampling scales from [8, 8, 2, 2] to [5, 4,\n4, 2] because the Mel-filterbank features\u2019s 10-ms frame interval equals 160 samples. We further fine-tuned\nthe HiFi-GAN vocoder by using the output of the PRETSSEL for 400k iterations to prevent the quality\n36\ndegradation from over-smoothing problem (Bishop, 1994). Specifically, we generated over-smoothed Mel-\nfilterbank features by inference PRETSSEL under teacher-forcing mode to prepare a pair of Mel-filterbank\nfeatures and waveform for fine-tuning. All other training settings follow the original HiFi-GAN training\nsetup (Kong et al., 2020).\nUnit Voicebox is pre-trained on the data in Table 17 as PRETSSEL. We include a baseline S2ST system\nwith PRETSSEL as the acoustic model (see Model 4 in Table 19) to compare with PRETSSEL in speech\nsynthesis. For data preprocessing introduced in Section 4.1, we further finetune Unit Voicebox on emotional\ndata to synthesize diverse speech. We describe more pre-training and finetuning details in the Appendix.\nExpressive\nAlignments\nSonar\nExpressive\nVideo\nAlignments\nCommissioned\ncTTS\nFrench\n1,949\n646\n299\n0\n1,515\nGerman\n994\n662\n122\n17\n1,503\nItalian\n286\n688\n68\n18\n1,614\nMandarin\n110\n42\n286\n14\n1,402\nSpanish\n1,729\n866\n237\n31\n1,637\nTotal\n5,068\n2,904\n1,012\n80\n7,671\nTable 18 - Prosody UnitY2 data statistics. Number of source speech hours in training data per data source and\nlanguage direction.\nProsody UnitY2.\nWe combined data from all training data sources and language directions described in\nTable 18. Given the large amount of Sonar data,we set thresholds and filtered the high-quality data: for\nSonar data, we selected source-target pairs with AutoPCP scores greater or equal to 3.2 and cosine scores\ngreater or equal to 0.75 for all directions. The amount of other data sources used for training is the same as\nreported in Table 16. With training data in 10 directions between English and five languages, we trained\na single multilingual speech-to-unit translation model for conducting objective evaluation with automatic\nmetrics and subjective human evaluation (Section 7.3). For the ablation study, we trained five bidirectional\nmodels for each language pair (X\u2013eng and eng\u2013X), one eng-to-many (E2M) model, and one many-to-eng\n(M2E) model. Those models help us understand how multilingual training affects translation performance.\nAll models were trained with a learning rate of 5 \u00d7 10\u22125. Bidirectional and M2E models were trained in a\ndistributed setup with an effective batch size of 302k tokens; E2M and M2M have a larger batch size of 360k\ntokens. We set a maximum of 600k training steps and adopted an early stop policy such that model training\nis stopped when validation loss has not been improved for the last 5 runs. The checkpoint with the best\nvalidation loss is used for evaluation.\nAutomatic metrics.\nWe adopted the following automatic metrics to measure both the semantics and the\nexpressive aspects of SeamlessExpressive.\n\u2022 ASR-BLEU. Our expressive translation systems must maintain high-quality content translation. We do\nmodel selection and analysis using average BLEU for S2TT and ASR-BLEU for S2ST (see Appendix H).\nThis pair of scores allows us to see the final model performance and how much the translation quality\nalters between text and its audio realization.\n\u2022 Vocal style similarity (VSim). Embeddings are extracted from generated and source speech using\na pretrained WavLM-based encoder (Chen et al., 2022). We measured the cosine similarity of the\nembeddings (as in Voicebox (Le et al., 2023)).\n\u2022 AutoPCP score. For sentence-level prosody transfer, we relied on the AutoPCP model trained on\nmultilingual data (see Section 7.1 for more details).\n\u2022 Rhythm: speech rate Spearman correlation (Rate) and joint pause alignment score (Pause). Speech rate\nis estimated from source and generated speech as described in Section 7.1, and we report Spearman\ncorrelation between the rates of the source and the target. Pause preservation was measured using the\nweighted mean joint pause alignment score from the rhythm evaluation toolkit described in Section 7.1.\n37\n4.4 Results and Discussion\nIn this section, we trained SeamlessExpressive models for expressive speech-to-speech translation. A card\nfor these models is available in Appendix C. We also perform empirical evaluation on SeamlessExpressive\nmodels together with different baselines, and 10 translation directions are included: English\u2194{French (fra),\nGerman (deu), Italian (ita), Mandarin (cmn), Spanish (spa)}.\nModels.\nTable 19 summarizes the model list for expressive S2ST evaluation. Given current progress in vocal\nstyle-preserved text-to-speech such as Coqui-XTTS15, we included a strong cascaded baseline, Model 1, which\nconsists of speech-to-text modules in SeamlessM4T v2 and the text-to-speech model Coqui-XTTS.\nOur proposed model is Model 5, SeamlessExpressive trained with 5-eng and eng-5 translation data.\nA natural baseline is Model 2, SeamlessM4T v2, which serves as our foundational model. To analyze\nthe performance of PRETSSEL, Model 3, which replaced the unit HiFi-GAN in SeamlessM4T v2 with\nPRETSSEL, is included as another baseline to measure the effectiveness of Prosody UnitY2 when compared\nagainst Model 5 and evaluates PRETSSEL in comparison with Model 2.\nAs Unit Voicebox is able to convert units to speech and is also used for training data augmentation,\nwe introduced Model 4 to compare PRETSSEL with Unit Voicebox in speech generation. For a fair\ncomparison with PRETSSEL, the pretrained checkpoint of Unit Voicebox is used in Model 4, and the\nfinetuned Unit Voicebox is only for the purpose of data augmentation.\nID\nModel\nSpeech-to-Unit/Text\nUnit/Text-to-Speech\n1\nS2TT +TTS\nSeamlessM4T v2S2TT\nCoqui-XTTS\n2\nSeamlessM4T v2\nUnitY2\nUnit HiFi-GAN\n3\n-\nUnitY2\nPRETSSEL\n4\n-\nProsody UnitY2\nUnit Voicebox\n5 (proposed)\nSeamlessExpressive\nProsody UnitY2\nPRETSSEL\nTable 19 - List of models for expressive S2ST.

FLEURS is mostly used to examine how the model is maintaining content\ntranslation quality from SeamlessM4T v2.\nMore detailed results in each language direction can be found in the appendix, where Table 73 reports results\non mExpresso, Table 74 on mDRAL, and Table 75 on FLEURS data. In this section, we focus on comparing\nthe models\u2019 performance on test sets because all conclusions we make also hold on development sets.\nExpressive speech-to-unit translation.\nWe compare Prosody UnitY2 and UnitY2 by looking at Models\n5 and 3, which differ in the speech-to-unit module. Model 5 demonstrates competitive ASR-BLEU. Averaged\nover five X\u2013eng directions, the gains of Model 5 on test data are +4.73 BLEU in mExpresso and +1.59\nBLEU in mDRAL while falling behind Model 3 by 1.34 BLEU in FLEURS. The average gains in five eng\u2013X\ndirections are +4.14 and +9.07 BLEU on mExpresso and mDRAL test sets, respectively. Both models have\ncomparable ASR-BLEU in FLEURS eng\u2013X data.\nExpressive speech generator.\nThe comparison of Model 3 against Model 2 reflects the effectiveness of\nPRETSSEL. Models 3 and 2 are close in terms of rate and pause metrics across three datasets, as these\naspects are mainly controlled by the speech-to-unit translation model. PRETSSEL makes good improvements\nin preserving prosody and the style of one\u2019s voice in generated speech. Given mDRAL test data in Table 22,\nPRETSSEL yields +0.22 vocal style similarity and +0.56 AutoPCP in X\u2013eng translations, +0.27 vocal\nstyle similarity and +0.4 AutoPCP in eng\u2013X translations. Both models have similar ASR-BLEU, indicating\nthat the preserved expressivity did not severely degrade the intelligibility of the output audio.\nCombining into SeamlessExpressive.\nCombining the strengths of Prosody UnitY2 and PRETSSEL,\nSeamlessExpressive (Model 5) demonstrates not only improved content translation but also better preser-\nvation of rhythm, tone, and the style of one\u2019s voice over the baseline SeamlessM4T v2 (Model 2). Figure 10\nfurther focuses on prosody-related metrics (Pause, Rate, AutoPCP) and breaks down the performance of\n40\neach language measured on mDRAL test data, where we see consistent improvement across different language\ndirections.\nAlternative expressive speech generator\nWe examine using Unit Voicebox as an alternative option\nfor expressive speech generation. We note that Unit Voicebox, with 329M parameters, is a much larger\nmodel than PRETSSEL with 65M parameters. Furthermore, PRETSSEL is faster in speech synthesis:\nthe real-time factor (RTF) of PRETSSEL is 0.014 and 0.089 for Unit Voicebox. Given the 6x lower\nRTF, PRETSSEL is a better fit as a speech generator considering the model size and inference efficiency\nwhen we equip SeamlessExpressive with streaming capability in Section 6. Models 5 and 4 show that the\nspeech generator choice mainly results in a trade-off in vocal style similarity (with Unit Voicebox having\nhigher vocal style similarity), while the performance in AutoPCP is similar across different language pairs\n(Figure 10).\nExpressive S2TT +TTS cascade\nWe observe that the strong cross-lingual vocal styles and style-preserving\nTTS system is sensitive to the noise in the source speech, resulting in a much lower ASR-BLEU than\nSeamlessExpressive, which is the most fundamental metric of an S2ST system. The TTS system is\nbetter in preserving the source speakers\u2019 vocal styles, while SeamlessExpressive outperforms in prosody\npreservation with consistent gains on AutoPCP, speech rate, and pause metrics across language directions\n(Figure 10).\n4.5 Ablation Study\nWe conducted ablation experiments to study the effectiveness of different training data and modeling choices.\nWe focused on mDRAL for the ablation studies as it allows us to examine all the semantic and prosodic\nmetrics meaningfully.\n4.5.1 Data ablation\nWe validated the effectiveness of all data sources listed in Table 18 on SeamlessExpressive by ablating each\nof them from training with a leave-one-out approach, with results presented in Table 24. We see the major\neffect of the data sources is on ASR-BLEU. A large amount of parallel training data helps achieve high content\ntranslation quality, while the prosody preservation performance can be maintained due to prosody-aligned\nparallel datasets.\n\u2191ASR-BLEU \u2191VSim\n\u2191AutoPCP \u2191Rate \u2191Pause\nAll data\n54.35\n0.27\n3.28\n0.64\n0.63\nw/o Commissioned\n53.09\n0.26\n3.25\n0.64\n0.64\nw/o Video Alignments\n53.11\n0.27\n3.26\n0.64\n0.61\nw/o cTTS\n52.60\n0.26\n3.27\n0.60\n0.59\nw/o Sonar Expressive\n54.30\n0.27\n3.25\n0.61\n0.59\nw/o Expressive Alignments\n53.54\n0.27\n3.28\n0.66\n0.63\nTable 24 - Data source ablation. Results on unidirectional spa-eng mDRAL test set.\n4.5.2 Semantic and prosodic data filtering\nThe quality of collected expressive data is variable. Some segments may contain different semantic content,\nharmful for translation, while others may evince similar content but with different prosody, harmful for\nexpressive translation. With this idea in mind, we conducted an analysis to better understand how to\ncharacterize and filter data based on their relevance for training an expressive translation system. For the sake\nof time, the ablation study described below is conducted only on video-aligned data. We chose this dataset\nbecause it is very rich (and also noisy) in terms of both semantic and prosody.\n41\nSemantic analysis.\nThe data is split into three equal-sized parts, one for each semantic quality, i.e., high,\nmedium, and low semantic score. The semantic score of a sample is a mixture of several semantic scores:\n\u2022 BLASER speech similarity,\n\u2022 cosine similarity between source and target text embeddings, and\n\u2022 cosine similarity between source and target speech embeddings.\nModel 5, SeamlessExpressive, is then finetuned with each data split, all other parameters unchanged, and\nthen evaluated (see Table 25).\nProsody analysis: the case of speech rate.\nAnother important aspect of training an expressive speech\ntranslation model is the prosodic quality of the training data. To evaluate the finetuning data\u2019s impact, we\nanalyzed the expressive training data and trained several models to contrast the results. For the sake of\nsimplicity, we only considered speech rate in this study, but we evaluated all semantic and prosodic scores.\nTo compare the speech rates of several languages, it is important to take their relative differences into account\nsince some languages are naturally uttered faster than others. Thus, we first normalized the speech rate of\naudio files in a language by the mean for that language and calculated the relative difference between source\nand target normalized speech rates, by dividing by their average, as follows:\nSRDnorm(SL1, SL2) = SRnorm(SL1) \u2212SRnorm(SL2)\nSRnorm(SL1) + SRnorm(SL2),\n(25)\nwhere SLx is a segment in language Lx, SRnorm is the normalized speech rate of SLx, and SRDnorm is the\nrelative speech rate difference.\nThis measure is then used to split the data into three parts of equal size, similar to what was done for the\nsemantic analysis. By doing this, we hoped to train systems that better model the relative speech rate\ndifference without considering intra-language variance. It is worth noting that by looking at the data, we\nrealized that the data labeled as \u201csemantic/low\u201d added too much noise to the statistics and that removing\nthem before performing the prosodic analysis was beneficial. This means that the three prosodic splits are\ntaken from the high and medium semantic quality data samples only.\nStudy\nQuality\n\u2191ASR-BLEU\n\u2191VSim\n\u2191AutoPCP\n\u2191Rate\n\u2191Pause\nX\u2013eng\n(n = 5)\nSemantic\nLow\n32.15\n0.26\n3.09\n0.62\n0.25\nMedium\n35.40\n0.27\n3.12\n0.64\n0.20\nHigh\n40.19\n0.27\n3.14\n0.59\n0.27\nProsody\nLow\n38.90\n0.27\n3.10\n0.50\n0.16\nMedium\n39.61\n0.27\n3.18\n0.62\n0.45\nHigh\n39.06\n0.27\n3.18\n0.66\n0.44\neng\u2013X\n(n = 5)\nSemantic\nLow\n22.56\n0.31\n2.84\n0.51\n0.13\nMedium\n28.19\n0.32\n2.88\n0.56\n0.11\nHigh\n33.48\n0.32\n2.84\n0.54\n0.17\nProsody\nLow\n32.57\n0.32\n2.83\n0.49\n0.10\nMedium\n32.96\n0.33\n2.88\n0.57\n0.33\nHigh\n33.48\n0.32\n2.90\n0.63\n0.31\nTable 25 - Results of data filtering based on semantic and prosody alignment quality on mDRAL test sets.\nAblation results with semantic and prosodic filtering.\nTable 25 shows the results of finetuning the model\nwith the semantic and prosodic splits of video data for X\u2013eng and eng\u2013X languages pairs, respectively.

The comparison of the finetuning results with the three data splits allows us to draw conclusions on the\nqualitative aspects of the selected data.\nLet us first look at the semantic study results. The performance gain is consistent across all datasets and\nlanguage pairs (see Appendix J.3 for language-level breakdown). We clearly see that the high and medium\nsemantic quality data leads to better ASR-BLEU scores, with an increase of up to 8% between semantic/high\nand semantic/low setups. This motivated us to keep only the average and high semantic quality data splits\nfor the prosodic study. However, models trained with the semantic splits do not necessarily exhibit better\nprosodic metric scores.\nLooking at the results obtained by finetuning the baseline model with prosodic splits, we observe consistent\nimprovements in speech rate and pause evaluation, which is expected. By selecting data according to a\nprosodic criterion (speech rate in our case), we observe improvements in the prosody metrics without hurting\nthe semantic score (ASR-BLEU) (and sometimes slightly improving it). This makes sense as it tends to\nconfirm that both aspects are correlated and that segments having the same prosody are more prone to be\nsemantically parallel. We can also notice that the vocal style similarity metric is not sensitive to the data\nrefinement and remains stable in all our experiments, since it is mainly controlled by the speech generator.\nThe results are also consistent across language directions (eng\u2013X and X\u2013eng) and show that all the considered\nlanguages can benefit from selecting higher semantic and prosodic quality data. Those good results suggest\nthat a better expressive model could be trained by carefully selecting the expressive data from all corpora\nbefore finetuning the model. We note that models reported in Section 4.4 and Section 7.3.2 have not applied\nsuch filtering to the training data due to time limit, so we leave that for future work.\n4.5.3 Training ablation\nJoint training.\nWhile our main results come from the cascade of Prosody UnitY2 and PRETSSEL\nmodels trained separately, we also explored joint training of the two components with the same initialization\nas the cascade. Joint training could mitigate the issue of error propagation in the cascaded model, while it\nsuffers from the constraint of requiring parallel S2ST training data fully aligned in prosody and voice style,\nwhich we tackled in data pre-processing described in Section 4.1.8. Specifically, we directed hidden states of\nNAR T2U decoder to PRETSSEL and jointly trained Prosody UnitY2 and PRETSSEL to reconstruct\ntarget Mel-filterbank features conditioned on outputs from one single shared PRETSSEL encoder. While\nPRETSSEL encoder should take input from the source speech features during inference, we found that\ntarget speech features could help the PRETSSEL decoder improve Mel-filterbank prediction during training.\nEmpirically, during training, we always fed source speech to PRETSSEL encoder for Prosody UnitY2\nconditioning, and randomly fed target or source speech to the PRETSSEL encoder with a probability of 80%\nand 20% respectively for PRETSSEL conditioning.\nAs shown in Table 26, joint training exhibits degradation in vocal style similarity and AutoPCP. We conjecture\nthat our pseudo-parallel S2ST data still lags on speaker and prosody alignment compared with human speech.\nWhen PRETSSEL is finetuned on our paired training data, its speaker and prosody preservation performance\ndegrades.\nMultilingual training.\nWe conducted an ablation study of models trained with different language directions\nto quantitatively compare how multilinguality affects model performance. Specifically, the following four\nmultilingual variants are considered:\n\u2022 SeamlessExpressive-Bilingual: bidirectional SeamlessExpressive models which are trained for\neach language pair respectively.\n43\n\u2191ASR-BLEU\n\u2191VSim\n\u2191AutoPCP\n\u2191Rate\n\u2191Pause\nX\u2013eng\n(n = 5)\nBilingual\n40.18\n0.27\n3.18\n0.63\n0.36\nM2E\n39.58\n0.27\n3.19\n0.63\n0.38\nM2M\n40.17\n0.27\n3.18\n0.63\n0.38\neng\u2013X\n(n = 5)\nBilingual\n33.08\n0.32\n2.91\n0.54\n0.35\nE2M\n32.37\n0.33\n2.87\n0.48\n0.34\nM2M\n33.82\n0.33\n2.92\n0.58\n0.35\nTable 27 - Results of different multilingual models on mDRAL test sets.\n\u2022 SeamlessExpressive-M2E: multidirectional models trained in 5-to-eng directions.\n\u2022 SeamlessExpressive-E2M: multidirectional models trained in eng-to-5 directions.\n\u2022 SeamlessExpressive-M2M: multidirectional model trained in both 5-to-eng and eng-to-5 directions.\nTable 27 compares the translation performance of multilingual models.

SeamlessStreaming\nIn this section, we present SeamlessStreaming, the first direct simultaneous multilingual and multimodal\ntranslation model, initialized from the foundational model SeamlessM4T v2 model (Section 3). More\nspecifically, SeamlessStreaming builds on SeamlessM4T v2\u2019s language coverage and semantic accuracy\nto perform direct translations from speech into both speech and text in real time. Like SeamlessM4T v2,\nSeamlessStreaming supports 101 source languages for speech input, 36 target languages in speech output,\nand 96 target languages in text output. SeamlessStreaming also support streaming ASR on 96 languages.\nAn overview of SeamlessStreaming and its relationship with SeamlessM4T v2 is shown as Figure 11. All\nin all, the highlights of SeamlessStreaming include:\n\u2022 Simultaneous text decoder empowered by Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA) (Sec-\ntion 5.1),\n\u2022 Fine-tuning from foundational SeamlessM4T v2 model and streaming inference (Section 5.2).\nMel-Filterbanks\nExtractor\nSpeech Encoder\nSimultaneous\nText Decoder\nEMMA\nNAR\nT2U Model\nHiFi-GAN\nunit-vocoder\nytext\nyspeech\nSpeech Encoder\nText Encoder\nText Decoder\nNAR\nT2U Model\nHiFi-GAN\nunit-vocoder\nShare Weights\nShare Weights\nInitialize\nInitialize\nSEAMLESSSTREAMING\nSEAMLESSM4T V2\nFigure 11 - A overview of SeamlessStreaming, and relationship with SeamlessM4T v2.\n5.1 Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA)\nIn SeamlessStreaming, the encoder first generates hidden representations from streaming input audio,\nwhich are then fed into a simultaneous text decoder. The simultaneous text decoder operates a policy, which\ndecides whether to predict the next token or pause the prediction to consume more context. In our case, we\nadopted Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA) (Ma et al., 2023) as the simultaneous policy.\nEMMA is a monotonic attention-based method (Raffel et al., 2017; Chiu* and Raffel*, 2018; Arivazhagan et al.,\n2019; Ma et al., 2020c), that estimates the monotonic alignment during the training time in an unsupervised\nfashion. In EMMA, each attention head operates an individual simultaneous policy. For simplicity, we only\ndiscuss the algorithm for one head, which can be easily extended it to multi-lyaer multihead attention.\n45\n5.1.1 Numerical stable estimation\nThe policy in the simultaneous text decoder is parameterized by a stepwise probability pi,j, which represents\nthe probability of generating the next prediction ytext\ni\ngiven partial input xspeech\n\u2264j\nand partial output ytext\n\u2264i\u22121.\npi,j is computed through the stepwise probability networks.\npi,j = Sigmoid\n\u0012FFNs(si\u22121)T FFNh(hj) + b\n\u03c4\n\u0013\n,\n(26)\nwhere FFNs and FFNh are multi-layer feedforward networks serving as energy projections, si\u22121 is i \u22121-th\ndecoder state and hj is j-th encoder states. b is a learnable bias, initialized by a negative value, which makes\nit an easier optimization from the offline policy. \u03c4 is the temperature factor to encourage polarized output\nfrom the stepwise probability network.\nTo train the stepwise probability network, we estimated the probability of the alignment of partial output\nytext\n\u2264i\u22121 with partial input xspeech\n\u2264j\n, or the event where there happens to be j source input when the partial\noutput length is i \u22121. Denote this probability as \u03b1i,j. Given the stepwise probability from Equation (26),\n\u03b1i,j can be represented as:\n\u03b1i,j = pi,j\nj\nX\nk=1\n\u03b1i\u22121,k\nj\u22121\nY\nl=k\n(1 \u2212pi,l),\n(27)\nwhich is also known as monotonic attention.\nThe computation of Equation (27) is not trivial in training time. In prior work on monotonic attention,\nEquation (27) was estimated into a closed-form representation (Raffel et al., 2017), which computed \u03b1 in\nparallel. However, such an estimation is numerically unstable and biased. EMMA, however, introduces a\nnumerical stable estimation of monotonic attention duration training time. This expression can be reformulated\ninto a parallel version (Ma et al., 2023) 18:\n\u03b1i,: = pi,: \u2299\u03b1i\u22121,:triu0\n\u0000cumprod2(1 \u2212triu1\n\u0000J|xspeech|\u00d71roll1(pi,:)\n\u0001\n)\n\u0001\n.\n(28)\nNotably, this estimation process is of closed-form, with the benefit of numerical stability and unbiasedness (as\nit does not require a denominator within the equation in (Raffel et al., 2017)). A comprehensive derivation of\nthis closed-form estimation is provided in Appendix K.1.2.\nFurthermore, during training, we adapted the infinite-lookback (Arivazhagan et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2020c)\nversion of monotonic attention. Once the \u03b1 is estimated, we then estimated the softmax weights \u03b2 in\nencoder-decoder attention as\n\u03b2ij =\n|xspeech|\nX\nk=j\n \n\u03b1ikeij\nPk\nl=1 eil\n!\n,\n(29)\nwhere eij is the attention energy between j-th input and i-th output. Equation (29) can be also computed in\nparallel as\n\u03b2i: = ei: \u2299flip2\n\u0012\ncumsum\n\u0012\nflip2\n\u0012\n\u03b1i: \u2299\n1\ncumprod (ei:)\n\u0013\u0013\u0013\n.\n(30)\nFinally, the attention of each head used in the training can be expressed as\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = \u03b2V.\n(31)\n5.1.2 Policy regularization\nBecause only the infinite lookback variant of monotonic attention is applied to SeamlessStreaming, it is\nnecessary to add regularization loss functions in order to prevent the model from learning a trivial offline\npolicy. As such, we applied two regularizations to the monotonic attention.\n18See Appendix K.1.1 for the definition of the operators\n46\nLatency describes how much partial information is needed for the model to start translating. Consistent\nwith prior work (Arivazhagan et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2020c), we used expected delays for latency regularization.\nDenoting the expected delays for i-th target text as \u00afdtext\ni\n, which is computed as\n\u00afdtext\ni\n= E[j|i] =\n|xspeech|\nX\nk=1\nk\u03b1i,k.\n(32)\nGiven a latency metric C, the loss term is then computed as\nLlatency = C( \u00afdtext\n1\n, . . . , \u00afdtext\n|ytext|).\n(33)\nVariance of the alignment characterizes the certainty of an estimation. Arivazhagan et al. (2019) proposed a\nmethod to reduce uncertainty by introducing a Gaussian noise to the input of stepwise probability network in\nEquation (26). However, empirical results show that the method is inefficient, especially when used in speech\ntranslation models. Therefore, we propose an alternative regularization-based strategy based on variance\nestimation. Denoting \u00afvi as the expected variances of the monotonic alignment for target token ytext\ni\n, \u00afvi can\nbe expressed as\n\u00afvi = E[(j \u2212E[j|i])2|i] = E[j2|i] \u2212E[j|i]2 =\n|xspeech|\nX\nk=1\nk2\u03b1i,k \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n|xspeech|\nX\nk=1\nk\u03b1i,k\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n2\n.\n(34)\nWe then introduced the alignment variance loss as follows:\nLvariance =\n1\n|ytext|\n|ytext|\nX\ni=1\n\u00afvi.\n(35)\nFinally, we optimized the model with the following objective:\nL(\u03b8) = \u2212log p(ytext|xspeech) + \u03bblatencyLlatency + \u03bbvarianceLvariance,\n(36)\nwhere \u03bblatency and \u03bbvariance are the loss weights.\n5.2 Experimental Setup\n5.2.1 Fine-tuning from SeamlessM4T v2\nMost existing frameworks in streaming translation require training the model from scratch. These approaches\noften require substantial resources, especially in large multilingual scenarios, such as SeamlessM4T v2. To\nleverage the language coverage and semantics accuracy achieved with the foundational SeamlessM4T v2\nmodel, we introduced a two-stage scheme for streaming fine-tuning, as shown in Figure 12.\nIn the first stage, we only trained a simultaneous speech-to-text model. For the encoder, we reused the\nSeamlessM4T v2 speech encoder and froze it during training. For the decoder, we initialized the parameters\nof generation network from SeamlessM4T v2 text decoder, and randomly initialize stepwise probability\nnetworks. Furthermore, we added a negitive bias to the stepwise probability networks to let policy optimize\nfrom offline policy.\nIn the second stage, we froze the speech-to-text part of the model, and only trained the text-to-unit model.\nSimilar to the text decoder, we initialized the text-to-unit model from SeamlessM4T v2.\nFor streaming-finetuning, we only used the label and pseudo-labled data described in Section 3.1.\n47\nSpeech Encoder\nSimultaneous\nText Decoder\nEMMA\nSEAMLESSM4T V2\nText Decoder\nInitialize\nSpeech Encoder\nSimultaneous\nText Decoder\nEMMA\nSEAMLESSM4T V2\nNAR T2U Model\nNAR T2U Model\nInitialize\nStage 1\nStage 2\nFigure 12 - Streaming Finetuning of SeamlessStreaming from SeamlessM4T v2. The weight of the module in\nshadowed boxes were frozen during training.\n5.2.2 Streaming inference\nWe used SimulEval (Ma et al., 2020a) to build the streaming inference pipeline. The overall inference\nalgorithm is illustrated in Algorithm 1. For streaming speech input, we updated the whole encoder every\ntime a new speech chunk is received by the model. Then, we ran the text decoder to generate partial text\ntranslation based on a policy. Finally, we passed the text output and decoder states to the text-to-unit model.\nBecause of the new non-autoregressive design of UnitY2 text-to-unit decoder (Section 3.3), we were able to\ndirectly feed text decoder states to text-to-unit model to generate aligned unit chunks We only synthsized\nspeech when the length of unit chunks were greater than a minimal number Lunit.\n5.2.3 Latency metrics\nGiven the input of the model xspeech, define the delay of the output text as dtext, where each element dtext\ni\nis\nthe length of input utilized in generating the corresponding output element ytext\ni\n. dtext\ni\nis measured by the\nnumber of seconds for speech input. In a simultaneous translation system, dtext\ni\n< |xspeech|. Meanwhile, an\noffline translation means dtext\ni\n= |xspeech| for all i.\nBesides quality, we also evaluated the latency of the system. For text output, we used the commonly used\nmetrics Average Lagging (AL) (Ma et al., 2019a) and Length-Adaptive Average Lagging (LAAL) (Papi et al.,\n2022), with AL defined as\nAL =\n1\n\u03c4(|ytext\ni\n|)\n\u03c4(|ytext\ni\n|)\nX\ni=1\ndtext\ni\n\u2212d\u2217\ni ,\n(37)\nwhere \u03c4(|ytext|) = min{i|dtext\ni\n= |xspeech|} is the index of the first target translation when the policy first\nreaches the end of the source sentence. d\u2217\ni is the ideal policy defined as\nd\u2217\ni = (i \u22121) \u00b7 |xspeech|\n|ytext| ,\n(38)\nwhere ytext is the reference translation.\nIn LAAL, d\u2217\ni is instead defined as\nd\u2217\ni = (i \u22121) \u00b7\n|xspeech|\nmax{|ytext|, |\u02c6ytext|},\n(39)\nwhere \u02c6ytext is the predicted translation.\nAs suggested by Ma et al. (2020b), |xspeech| is measured by the number of source words for text input and in\nnumber of seconds of source speech for speech input.\nFor speech output, we simply used the ending offset,which is the time difference between the end of source\nspeech and the end pf translated speech.\n48\nAlgorithm 1 SeamlessStreaming Inference Algorithm\nRequire: ytext\nlang: Target language tag\nRequire: tEMMA : Decision threshold for EMMA\nRequire: Lunit: Minimal chunk size for units\nInput: Streaming speech xspeech\nOutput: Streaming speech yspeech\nOutput: Streaming text ytext\n1: i \u21901, j \u21900, k \u21900, ytext\n0\n\u2190ytext\nlang\n2: s0 \u2190TextDecoder(ytext\n0\n)\n3: while ytext\ni\u22121 \u0338= EndOfSequence do\n4:\nj \u2190j + 1\n5:\nh\u2264j \u2190SpeechEncoder(xspeech\n\u2264j\n)\n6:\nwhile ytext\ni\u22121 \u0338= EndOfSequence do\n\u25b7S2T Policy\n7:\np \u21901\n8:\nfor StepwiseProbabilty in all attention head do\n9:\np \u2190min(p, StepwiseProbabilty(hj, si\u22121))\n10:\nend for\n11:\nif p < t0 then\n12:\nBreak\n13:\nelse\n14:\nytext\ni\n, si \u2190TextDecoder(s<i, h\u2264j)\n15:\nk \u2190k + 1\n16:\ni \u2190i + 1\n17:\nend if\n18:\nend while\n19:\nif k > 0 then\n\u25b7Speech Generation\n20:\nhunit \u2190T2UEncoder(s\u2264i)\n21:\nudup \u2190T2UDecoder(hunit, si\u2212k:i)\n22:\nif |udup| \u2265Lunit then\n23:\nyspeech \u2190yspeech + Vocoder(udup)\n24:\nk \u21900\n25:\nend if\n26:\nend if\n27: end while\n5.3 Results and Discussion\n5.3.1 Quality-latency trade-Off\nIn this section, we present the translation quality and latency of the SeamlessStreaming Model. Because\nSeamlessStreaming can process two modalities at the same time, we report results for both speech-\nto-text and speech-to-speech translations.\nWe only report the model trained with a set of loss weight\nhyperparameters. The full results and metrics per evaluation direction can be found at https://github.\ncom/facebookresearch/seamless_communication.\nBy default, we set decision threshold tEMMA as 0.5 in Algorithm 1, which is also the default of EMMA\nmodel. We then adjusted latency at a granular level by changing tEMMA. We followed the post processing in\nSection 3.5 when computing BLEU scores on translation. When evaluating the streaming models, we removed\nthe starting and ending silence in the source audio to follow real life setting.\nWe first present the speech-to-text results on Fleurs, shown in Table 28. We report averaged all the\nquality and latency under on tEMMA setting. To make latency comparable across different languages, we\nevaluated average lagging (AL) and length-adaptive average lagging (LAAL) based on SentencePiece (Kudo\nand Richardson, 2018) tokens.\nWe also report the ASR performance of SeamlessStreaming in Table 29.

We show the percentage of BLEU score drop of\nthe model from the offline SeamlessM4T v2 large and latency under different setting, in Table 31 for text\noutput and Table 32 for speech output.\n50\nWe observe that in both speech and text output, high resource languages have smaller quality drop from\noffline SeamlessM4T v2. Furthermore, the latency on high resource languages are also smaller, especially\nunder X\u2013eng setting.\nIn zero-shot setting, we can see a significant drop in translation quality. We can also see very small average\nlagging under the zero-shot setting. A small average lagging and big quality drop indicate the model has over\ngeneration issue under such setting.\nResource Level\nX\u2013eng\n(n=101)\neng\u2013X\n(n=87)\n\u2193BLEU loss (%)\n\u2193AL\n\u2193LAAL\n\u2193BLEU loss (%)\nAL\n\u2193LAAL\nHigh\n10.1\n1.75\n2.08\n10.5\n1.94\n2.06\nMedium\n14.8\n2.09\n2.40\n13.1\n1.97\n2.11\nLow\n21.5\n1.89\n2.30\n17.9\n2.00\n2.16\nZero-Shot\n31.4\n0.44\n1.74\n23.3\n1.97\n2.18\nTable 31 - Average translation drop from SeamlessM4T v2 large and latency for languages in different resource\nsetting for speech-to-text task, tEMMA = 0.5\nResource Level\nX\u2013eng\n(n=101)\neng\u2013X\n(n=35)\n\u2193ASR BLEU loss (%)\n\u2193Ending\nOffset\n\u2193ASR BLEU loss (%)\n\u2193Ending\nOffset\nHigh\n16.0\n2.25\n19.7\n3.68\nMedium\n19.6\n2.45\n13.1\n4.03\nLow\n20.7\n2.61\n26.7\n4.15\nZero-Shot\n20.2\n2.20\n\u2014\n\u2014\nTable 32 - Average translation drop from SeamlessM4T v2 large and latency for languages in different resource\nsetting for speech-to-speech task, tEMMA = 0.5\nLanguage family.\nThe quality of streaming translation varies with language pairs due to linguistic divergence,\ncultural disparities, and speech speed. Intuitively, close language relationships and shared cultural contexts\nease streaming translation , while vast linguistic gaps, dissimilar syntax, and unfamiliar cultural nuances pose\nchallenges.\nBecause SeamlessStreaming is trained on English centered data, we also investigate the its performance\nwhen translate from or into different language families.

Seamless\nIn this section, we introduce Seamless, which combines two derivatives of SeamlessM4T v2, namely\nSeamlessExpressive \u2014an offline translation model with comprehensive prosody preservation\u2014and Seam-\nlessStreaming \u2014a multilingual streaming speech-to-speech translation model\u2014to engender a unified system\nthat provides real time and expressive S2ST. To the best of our knowledge, Seamless marks the first, publicly\navailable system of its kind, paving the way for a myriad of downstream possibilities that can help those\nexperiencing language barriers better communicate in the wild.\nNotably, Seamless maintains the same semantic accuracy and latency shown in SeamlessStreaming.\nIn addition, Seamless captures a key expressivity transfer features from SeamlessExpressive. More\nspecifically, it focuses to preserve sentence-level expressivity, e.g., tone, emotional expression and the style of\none\u2019s voice rather than phrase-level one, e.g., speech rate and pauses. Based on preliminary user testing, it\ndoes not appear that not offering the full suite of expressive preservation impacted the overall experience of\nour test subjects.\n52\nPRETSSEL\nSEAMLESSSTREAMING\nInput\nStreaming\nSpeech\nMel-Filterbanks\nExtractor\nSpeech Encoder\nSimultaneous\nText Decoder\nEMMA\nNAR\nT2U Model\ndeduplication\nTextless\nacoustic model\nconcat\nExpressivity\nencoder\nLanguage\nembedding\nHiFi-GAN\nMel-vocoder\nOutput\nStreaming\nSpeech\nFigure 15 - The architecture of Seamless.\n6.1 Architecture\nFigure 15 provides an overview of the architecture for the Seamless model. First, SeamlessStreaming\ngenerates streaming text and discrete units from source speech. SeamlessStreaming, empowered by EMMA\nand NAR T2U model, can be quickly adapted from the large-scale trained foundational SeamlessM4T v2, as\ndescribed in Section 5. Then, the generated units are fed into the expressive speech generator, PRETSSEL\nto preserve the sentence-level prosody and the style of one\u2019s voice from the partial source speech. Finally, the\nsynthesized Mel-filterbank features from the textless acoustic model will be fed to the HiFi-GAN vocoder to\nproduce expressive translated speech in real-time.\nThe base version of PRETSSEL in SeamlessExpressive supports six high-resource languages. In order\nto study the behavior of this unified architecture when language support is further scaled, we also trained\na version of PRETSSEL with an extended set of 36 languages and tested it with Seamless. Details on\nlanguage coverage and training data statistics can be found in Appendix L.1.\nWe present two versions of Seamless \u2014Seamless-6 and Seamless-36. While Seamless-6 shares Seamless-\nExpressive\u2019s coverage for high-resource languages, Seamless-36 extends its language coverage to that of\nSeamlessStreaming by leveraging the language-extended PRETSSEL model.\n6.2 Results and Discussion\nWe only conducted automatic evaluations on the Seamless.\n6.2.1 PRETSSEL extension\nWe report the automatic measurement of PRETSSEL trained with different data. We document the offline\nperformance of two different PRETSSEL models, namely PRETSSEL-619 and PRETSSEL-36, in Table 33.\nAs evidenced by the results, English output remains of similar quality overall. The significantly expanded\nset of languages does, however, come at the cost of lowering performance for non-English target languages,\nas measured by ASR-BLEU and vocal style similarity. Overall, results demonstrate the feasibility of broad\nlanguage support for PRETSSEL, although a larger model might be required for increased capacity.\n19Note that this model is same PRETSSEL model used for SeamlessExpressive.\n53\nMetrics\nX\u2013eng\n(n=101)\neng\u2013X\n(n=5)\neng\u2013X\n(n=35)\nPRETSSEL\nLanguage Coverage\n6\n36\n6\n36\n6\n36\nASR-BLEU\n25.8\n25.5\n29.3\n28.3\n\u2013\n22.78\nVocal Style Similarity\n0.30\n0.30\n0.24\n0.19\n\u2013\n0.18\nAutoPCP\n2.35\n2.46\n2.80\n2.88\n\u2013\n2.86\nTable 33 - The automatic measurement on Fleurs of the PRETSSEL models trained on six and 36 languages.

We can see that the model has a small degradation from Seam-\nlessStreaming on ASR-BLEU in both X\u2013eng and eng\u2013X directions. Seamless has a lower ending offset,\nwhich means the PRETSSEL model can generate speech with a shorter duration. Seamless-6 has better\nperformance for SeamlessExpressive\u2019s six target language directions than Seamless-36, while Seamless-36\nhas the same coverage as SeamlessStreaming.

Automatic and Human Evaluation\nTo properly evaluate our models we relied on a combination of existing and novel metrics which are compiled\nin the newly proposed concept of metric card Section 9.2. In this section, we specifically detailed the novel\ncontributions in automatic expressivity metrics, followed by presenting results of our models in terms of\nrobustness and several human evaluation protocols.\n7.1 Automatic Expressivity Metrics\nTo ensure the quality of SeamlessExpressive, we relied on measures that evaluate the prosodic consistency\nof source and target speech.\nEarly work on comparing prosody across languages (Cummins et al., 1999) used an LSTM-based (Hochreiter\nand Schmidhuber (1997)) model with features based on F0 contour and amplitude envelope. In Ward et al.\n(2023); Avila and Ward (2023), the authors created an English-Spanish corpus (DRAL) and provided an\nanalysis of the prosodic relation between a pair of audios by calculating the Spearman correlation of 100\nfeatures (e.g., intensity, speaking rate, pitch) and provided a simple metric corresponding to the Euclidean\ndistance between the two prosodic representations.\nWe contribute two types of automatic measures of prosodic preservation in speech translation: 1) AutoPCP\nto evaluate prosody at the sentence level and 2) a rhythm evaluation toolkit.\nAutoPCP.\nOur main measure of prosodic preservation, PCP (Huang et al. (2023); see also Section 7.3.1),\ncorresponds to human judgments (using a 4-point Likert scale) of how similarly two spoken utterances sound\nin prosody. AutoPCP is a neural model trained to predict PCP scores of \u201csentence-level prosody similarity\u201d.\nThis model has an architecture similar to BLASER (Chen et al., 2023b): embedding vectors of two audios (in\nour case, obtained by pooling embeddings from the 9th layer of an XLS-R model (Conneau et al., 2020)) are\npassed into a small fully-connected neural network that predicts the target score.\nWe trained AutoPCP with two tasks: supervised regression and an unsupervised contrastive task. For\nregression, we annotated with simplified PCP in which annotators are asked about a single expressive dimension\n\u201cOverall Manner,\u201d analogous to the dimension \u201cOverall Expressive Intent\u201c described in Section 7.3.1. In total,\nwe collected nearly 800 sentence pairs for each translation direction (from French, Italian, German, Mandarin,\nand Spanish to English). To ensure that the dataset contains audio pairs with diverse prosodic similarity\ndegrees, we compiled it from several sources:\n\u2022 Audio pairs from multilingual videos (Section 4.1.4), with naturally diverse quality;\n\u2022 M4T training data (Section 3.1), with either original or re-synthesized target speech;\n56\n\u2022 Audio pairs synthesized using cTTS, with both matching and mismatching speech rate and pauses\n(following Section 4.1.6);\n\u2022 mExpresso audio pairs (Section 4.1.1) with matching and mismatching styles.\nAs a source of contrastive data, we used the parallel corpus from multilingual videos (Section 4.1.4); the model\nis trained to predict higher scores for positive examples (the original audio pairs) than for hard negative\nexamples (re-combined audio pairs with similar semantic embeddings of their transcriptions). We return to the\ndiscussion of human- and automatic-metric correlation under our human evaluation test sets in Section 7.3.5.\nWe evaluated the resulting model with three metrics on a test set annotated with PCP: item-level and\nsystem-level Spearman correlations and RMSE. As Table 38 shows, the model performs robustly across\nlanguages, and its results are comparable to human-level, computed as judgments of a single randomly chosen\nannotator compared to the median score of the other annotators. We also validate the model by comparing it\nto a simple baseline: cosine similarity of the same XLS-R speech embeddings, rescaled to minimize RMSE on\nthe test set. The AutoPCP model demonstrates much better item- and system-level correlation with the\ntarget than the baseline.\nThe model card for AutoPCP is given in Appendix G.\nAutoPCP\nbaseline\nhuman\nSystem\ndeu\nspa\nfra\nita\ncmn\navg\navg\navg\nItem-level correlation \u2191\n0.58\n0.50\n0.44\n0.50\n0.44\n0.49\n0.31\n0.46\nSystem-level correlation \u2191\n0.60\n0.58\n0.60\n0.77\n0.72\n0.65\n0.28\n0.84\nRMSE \u2193\n0.68\n0.61\n0.88\n0.85\n0.90\n0.79\n0.81\n0.97\nTable 38 - Evaluation of the AutoPCP model. To estimate human-level performance, for each sample, we randomly\nselected the label from one randomly chosen annotator and compared it to the median label from the other annotators.\nThe same target is used to estimate model performance. By \u201csystem\u201d here, we denote a combination of the data source\nand the method to obtain the target audio.\nRhythm evaluation toolkit.\nTo complement AutoPCP, a blackbox predictor of overall prosodic similarity,\nwe designed tools for quantifying and comparing several individual aspects of prosody in a more interpretable\nway. More specifically, we focused on evaluating rhythm as realized in speech rate and pauses.\n\u2022 Speech rate: the number of syllables per second21. We obtained the syllables by running the \u201csyllables\u201d\npython package on the transcription (except for Mandarin, where we counted each character as a syllable)\nand dividing their number by the net duration of the audio in seconds, computed using Silero VAD\n(Silero, 2021).\n\u2022 Pauses: we detected pauses and their durations with Silero VAD and located them between the words\nof the transcription using the UnitY2 aligner (Section 3.3.2). To evaluate whether a pause is located\ncorrectly in the translation, we aligned the source and translation words with AwesomeAlign (Dou and\nNeubig, 2021), and used the proportion of word alignment edges that do not cross the edge connecting\ntwo matched pauses as the metric of pause location. For each source-translation pair, we computed the\njoint score as the average product of the location score of each pause and its shorter-to-longer duration\nratio in the pair. To aggregate these scores over multiple sentence pairs, we computed their average\nweighted by total pause duration in each pair.\nWe evaluated these evaluation metrics by computing their correlation with PCP labels on the Expresso-based\nsubset of the English-Spanish data annotated in Huang et al. (2023), reported in Table 39. As expected,\ncomputed speech rate similarity and pause similarity moderately correlate with overall judgments of prosody\npreservation.\nThese tools are used for annotating training data in Section 4.5.2 to apply prosodic filtering and selecting the\nmost relevant samples from the expressive data that has been aligned or generated.

Simulated noises are sampled from MUSAN (Snyder et al., 2015) on the \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cmusic\u201d\ncategories.\n7.2 Robustness Automatic Evaluation\nWe evaluated model robustness against background noise and vocal style variations as examples of non-\nlinguistic perturbations in real-world speech inputs. We used benchmarks from Seamless Communication\net al. (2023) and compared our models to Whisper-Large-v2.\nRobustness against background noise.\nFigure 16 shows the average test BLEU and test WER over the\nfour languages for X\u2013eng S2TT and ASR on Fleurs with low-to-high input noise level (high-to-low SNR).\nBoth BLEU-SNR curves for our new model, SeamlessM4T-Large v2 are consistently above those for\nWhisper-Large-v2 and SeamlessM4T-Large. Similarly, SeamlessM4T-Large v2\u2019s WER-SNR curves\nare consistently below the ones for Whisper-Large-v2 and SeamlessM4T-Large. These indicate the\nsuperior robustness of SeamlessM4T-Large v2 in noisy speaking environments. SeamlessM4T-Large\nv2 outperforms Whisper-Large-v2 by an average of 53.2% and 50.5% over various noise types and levels\nfor X\u2013eng S2TT and ASR, respectively. It also outperforms our earlier model, SeamlessM4T-Large by an\naverage of 14.9% and 14.5% for X\u2013eng S2TT and ASR, respectively.\nRobustness against vocal style variations.\nTable 40 shows the chrFMS and CoefVarMS scores of SeamlessM4T-\nLarge v2, SeamlessM4T-Large and Whisper-Large-v2 on Fleurs X\u2013eng S2TT and ASR test sets. We\nsee that SeamlessM4T-Large v2 outperforms Whisper-Large-v2 on CoefVarMS by an average of 66.4%\nover X\u2013eng S2TT and ASR tasks. Moreover, SeamlessM4T-Large v2 outperforms Whisper-Large-v2 on\nchrFMS by an average of 31.5%. Note that SeamlessM4T v2 also outperforms SeamlessM4T-Large on\nboth tasks and metrics. These suggest the superior robustness of SeamlessM4T-Large v2 when it comes\nto vocal style variations.\n58\nModel\nFleurs X\u2013eng S2TT\nFleurs ASR\nchrFMS\u2191\nCoefVarMS\u2193\nchrFMS\u2191\nCoefVarMS\u2193\nWhisper-Large-v2\n40.8\n13.7\n58.7\n17.0\nSeamlessM4T-Large\n45.3\n9.1\n72.5\n6.4\nSeamlessM4T-Large v2\n51.6\n6.3\n79.2\n4.0\nTable 40 - Evaluation results of model robustness against vocal style variations.

In a later update,\nwe will present the complete set of human evaluations, including the full set of languages, directions, and\nmodels.\nFirst, we provide an overview of each protocol used in human evaluations, a description of human evaluation\nbenchmark test-set data, followed by analysis and results.\n7.3.1 Human evaluation protocols\nProtocol\nDirection\nSystems\nLanguages\nPCP\nX\u2013eng\n5\n5\nPCP\neng\u2013X\n-\n-\nMOS\nX\u2013eng\n5\n3\nMOS\neng\u2013X\n5\n5\nTable 41 - Summary of evaluations: languages, models, and protocols used in the current expressivity human\nevaluations. Note that at the time of writing, human evaluation for PCP had not been completed in the eng\u2013X\ndirection.\nMOS.\nAs in Seamless Communication et al. (2023), we adopted the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) protocol\n(a 5-point Likert scale) ITU-T Recommendation P.808 (2018) to evaluate the speech quality of all models\npresented in this paper, except for a subset of data in the X\u2013eng direction.22 The MOS protocol utilized here\nmeasures three aspects:\n1. Naturalness: \u201chow natural is the speech?\u201d\n2. Sound quality: \u201chow good is the sound quality?\u201d\n3. Speech clarity: \u201chow clear is the speech?\u201d\nA more detailed protocol explanation can be found in Seamless Communication et al. (2023). In this work,\neach item is evaluated by three annotators. No calibration set is evaluated, and we did not source additional\nannotators upon disagreement, as we did for Cross-Lingual Semantic Textual Similarity (XSTS; (Licht et al.,\n2022), (Seamless Communication et al., 2023)).\n22In particular, for expressivity, we only evaluated MOS on a subsample of n=100 items from each dataset in the X\u2013eng\ndirection\n59\nPCP.\nTo measure the extent to which expressive characteristics are matched between source- and target-\naudio, we used a modified version of the Prosodic Consistency Protocol (PCP), previously presented in Huang\net al. (2023). In this task, bilingual annotators are asked to listen to both source and target audio and rate\nsimilarity along three \u201cexpressive\u201d dimensions\u2014rhythm, emotion, and overall expressive intent (abbreviated\nOEI throughout) and one semantic dimension, using a 4-pt Likert scale ranging from 1\u2014 Completely different\nto 4\u2014 Completely similar. Annotators were asked to complete this task while ignoring differences in the\nspeakers\u2019 voices. This represents a reduced set of prosodic dimensions (minus emphasis and intonation)\ncompared to the original protocol presented in Huang et al. (2023). The simplification in expressive aspects,\nalong with refinements in annotator instructions and the inclusion of more diverse language examples, reflects\na more cross-linguistic compatible protocol amenable to \u201cdistant\u201d language pairs, including English-Mandarin,\nas evaluated in this work. The entire protocol can be viewed (with format adapted) in Appendix M.2.\nPCP annotation process.\nDuring annotation, five bilingual annotators23 examined each source-target audio\npair and evaluated the pair\u2019s similarity in semantics, emotion, rhythm, and OEI using the PCP protocol.\nBefore annotating, all annotators went through a set of pre-study calibration (practice) examples with score\njustifications. To expedite evaluation, more than five annotators were used per language pair (up to n = 40);\neach evaluated sentence pair was shown to five annotators, assigned randomly. The median score over\nannotators of the same audio pair was then taken for each evaluation sentence pair; the median is used for\nrobustness. For overall direction scores, we report the mean of this median score across all evaluated items in\nthe dataset generated by a particular system in a language direction.\n7.3.2 Human evaluation test sets\nExpressivity benchmark test-sets.\nHuman evaluations for the Expressivity comparison set (Models 2-5 as\ndescribed in Table 19) were conducted on a subset of test partitions (Table 20) selected from mExpresso,\nmDRAL, and Fleurs test partitions (see Table 43). Filtering logic for the benchmark test-set required\nthat all samples be 1 second or longer in duration and contain at least three tokens (or characters when\nappropriate).\nEach domain in the benchmark test set contributes different characteristics of interest. Given these differences,\nhuman evaluation protocols were selectively assigned to domains in the benchmark set for which the underlying\ndata contained variations of interest. For example, mExpresso read-speech recordings are acted in distinctive\nstyles, which make use of the PCP protocol appropriate.\nWe evaluated MOS-quality measures across\nall domains; however, we subsampled in the X\u2013eng direction by domain as we did not expect significant\nvariation between languages translated into English. Table 42 summarizes the mapping between protocols\nand benchmark test sets.\nmExpresso human evaluation test set.\nmExpresso data is described in Section 4.1.1 (along with the\ncollection procedure in Appendix N), however we provide additional details here. Data in this test set is unique\namong the Expressive evaluation sets as all utterances are pivoted through the original English read-speech\ncollection of (Nguyen et al., 2023). That is, semantic content and read styles are matched across all languages\nfor X\u2013eng and eng\u2013X directions. To this end, we sampled the mExpresso human evaluation test-set such that\nsamples (in their content and styles) are matched across the languages. The final mExpresso style-set includes\n\u201cconfused\u201d, \u201cdefault\u201d, \u201cenunciated\u201d, \u201chappy\u201d, \u201csad\u201d, \u201cwhisper\u201d.\nmDRAL human evaluation test set.\nmDRAL data is described in Section 4.1.2 (along with the collection\nprocedure in Appendix N), however we provide additional details here. mdRAL data is the only benchmark\nset in which reference source- and target-speakers are matched. Due to the nature of the collection process\n(spontaneous conversations occur in one language, then re-enacted by the original bi-lingual speakers in the\nsecond language), we sampled our benchmark test set to ensure near-uniform coverage across speakers.\nFleurs human evaluation test set.\nTest data was sampled from the test-partition of Fleurs data (Conneau\net al., 2020) for each language pair. Seamless Communication et al. (2023) gives a more complete overview\n23Annotators must pass language proficiency tests to be included in the study.\n60\nof the Fleurs test-set and standard sampling recipes for conducting translation quality evaluation such as\nXSTS (Licht et al., 2022). For the current Expressivity human evaluation, in which we were only interested in\nevaluating MOS-measures on FLEURs, we sampled uniformly from the test set.\nPCP\nMOS\nmExpresso\n\u2713\n\u2713\nmDRAL\n\u2713\n\u2713\nFleurs\n\u2717\n\u2713\nTable 42 - Protocol use by Human Evaluation benchmark test-set domain.\nmExpresso\nmDRAL\nFleurs\nSample #\n4818\n2020\n1500\nHours\n6.24\n2.07\n4.47\nTotal # Speakers\n9\n55\n-\nTotal # Male Speakers\n4\n19\n-\nTable 43 - Descriptive statistics of the human evaluation benchmark test-set aggregating over all language directions.\nNote that we do not have speaker information for Fleurs so these rows are left empty.\n7.3.3 Analysis and results\nWe present an analysis of available human evaluation data focusing on the language pair by protocol\ncombinations with adequate samples. Please note the use of model identifiers, which refer to model naming\nconventions described in Table 19. Throughout, we report bootstrap re-sampled mean and standard error\nestimates, re-sampling nb = 500 times at the item level. At the time of writing, we had sufficient sample to\nreport results on a subset of PCP X\u2013eng directions (excluding cmn and fra) and no results in the eng\u2013X\ndirection. We report results for all MOS directions. Subsequent updates will include data and analysis for the\nremaining language directions and protocols. Note that unless stated otherwise, in both tables and written\ntext we standardly report estimated mean values with standard errors included in parentheses.\nA note on baseline model (SeamlessM4T v2) used in Expressivity Human Evaluation.\nFor transparency,\nwe note that there is a minor difference in the baseline systems (Model 2, SeamlessM4T v2) used to report\nHuman Evaluation results and used to report automatic evaluation results (Section 4.4). The discrepancy is\nbased on how the two models\u2019 unit-level duration information is produced during inference. In particular, the\nmodel used in the automatic results section uses a frame-level sequence of acoustic units, which are then used\nby a unit vocoder to produce the waveform. In contrast, the human evaluation baseline model relied on a unit\nvocoder to generate frame-level duration using the reduced sequence of acoustic tokens. That mismatch has\nshown only a slight change in the automatic scores as described in Appendix J. Given the minimal changes to\nautomatic scores, we do not believe this discrepancy impacts conclusions related to the comparison of the\nbaseline and Expressivity models.\nKey findings\n\u2022 PRETSSEL. Comparisons between Model 2 (SeamlessM4T v2) and Model 3 (SeamlessM4T v2\n+PRETSSEL) serve as an ablation of the PRETSSEL module. We see consistent improvement with\nthe inclusion of PRETSSEL with higher scores for Model 3 across all PCP expressive dimensions, but\nwith declines in some MOS subscores.\nOn expressivity dimensions, aggregating across language and datasets, we see nominal improvements\nfor \u201crhythm\u201d (\u03b4=0.30; 3.03 (0.14) vs 2.73 (0.14)), \u201cemotion\u201d (\u03b4=0.60; 3.18 (0.13) vs 2.58 (0.14)), and\n\u201cOEI\u201d (\u03b4=0.39; 3.03 (0.11) vs 2.64 (0.11)) across all X\u2013eng directions (see rows 4 and 5 of Table 44\nfor within-domain results). While variation between languages exists, PRETSSEL has higher PCP\nsubscores compared to SeamlessM4T v2 for all languages (see Table 78).\n61\nOn MOS dimensions, aggregating over languages by system we observe that the addition of the\nPRETSSEL module results in lower MOS subscores for \u201cclarity of speech\u201d (\u03b4=-0.49; 4.09 (0.08) vs 4.58\n(0.06)) and \u201csound quality\u201d (\u03b4=-0.79; 3.64 (0.08) vs 4.42 (0.07)), but remains at parity for \u201cnaturalness\u201d\n(\u03b4=0.03; 4.01 (0.09) vs 3.97 (0.09)) compared to the SeamlessM4T v2 model without the PRETSSEL\nmodule (see Table 45 for within-domain results).\n\u2022 SeamlessM4T v2 +PRETSSEL vs SeamlessExpressive. Comparisons between Model 3 (SeamlessM4T\nv2 +PRETSSEL) and Model 5 (SeamlessExpressive) serve as an ablation of the Prosody UnitY2\ncomponent, which controls the speech rate and pauses. We see consistent improvement across all PCP\nexpressive dimensions, but with some declines in MOS \u201cnaturalness\u201d subscores.\nOn expressivity dimensions, aggregating across language and datasets, we see improvements for \u201crhythm\u201d\n(\u03b4=0.58; 3.60 (0.07) vs 3.03 (0.14)), \u201cemotion\u201d (\u03b4=0.41; 3.60 (0.08) vs 3.18 (0.13)), and \u201cOEI\u201d (\u03b4=0.44;\n3.47 (0.09) vs 3.03 (0.11)). Note that in the case of mExpresso data, in which different speakers enact\nsource- and target-pairs, Model 5 (and Model 4 for that matter) exceeds Human Reference on PCP\nexpressive dimensions. While Model 5 PCP scores are also high for mDRAL, they do not reach the level\nof Human Reference (see Table 44).\nOn MOS dimensions, aggregating across language and datasets, we see that Model 5 has lower \u201cnatural-\nness\u201d ratings, (\u03b4=-0.38; 3.62 (0.11) vs 4.01 (0.09)), but is at parity for \u201csound quality\u201d and \u201cclarity of\nspeech\u201d (\u03b4=-0.03; 3.60 (0.08) vs 3.64 (0.08)) subscores. Of the current comparison set, Model 5 performs\nworst overall on \u201cnaturalness\u201d and \u201csound quality\u201d ratings.\n\u2022 SeamlessExpressive vs. Prosody UnitY2 +Unit Voicebox. Comparisons between Model 5\n(SeamlessExpressive) and Model 4 (Prosody UnitY2 +Unit Voicebox) serve as an ablation of\nthe speech generation module. Results indicate that the use of Unit Voicebox can further improve on\nMOS subscores, including \u201cclarity of speech\" (\u03b4=0.26; 4.41 (0.06) vs 4.14 (0.07)) and \u201csound quality\u201d\n(\u03b4=0.55; 4.15 (0.07) vs 3.60 (0.08)), while it does not improve on the aspects of expressivity preservation.\nmDRAL\nmExpresso\nID\nOEI\nEmotion\nRhythm\nOEI\nEmotion\nRhythm\nX\u2013eng\nReference\n3.71 (0.08)\n3.82 (0.09)\n3.82 (0.08)\n3.33 (0.07)\n3.38 (0.07)\n3.54 (0.07)\n5\n3.48 (0.11)\n3.48 (0.09)\n3.65 (0.08)\n3.46 (0.06)\n3.56 (0.06)\n3.56 (0.06)\n4\n3.42 (0.12)\n3.42 (0.10)\n3.59 (0.11)\n3.35 (0.06)\n3.56 (0.07)\n3.55 (0.07)\n3\n3.18 (0.14)\n3.27 (0.16)\n3.20 (0.17)\n2.89 (0.07)\n3.09 (0.09)\n2.85 (0.11)\n2\n2.79 (0.16)\n2.79 (0.19)\n2.90 (0.19)\n2.50 (0.07)\n2.44 (0.09)\n2.56 (0.10)\nTable 44 - Human Evaluation results for PCP expressive dimensions (scale is 1-4).

See Table 78 for aggregate scores on the language direction and dataset\nlevel.\n7.3.4 Understanding MOS-quality measures for expressive models\nResults as discussed in Section 7.3.3 indicate a somewhat curious finding\u2014the inclusion of expressivity-\npreserving modules such as PRETSSEL and Prosody UnitY2 (in particular Models 3 and 5) lead to\nsubstantial improvements on expressivity-preservation measures such as \u201cRhythm\u201d, \u201cEmotion\u201d and \u201cOEI.\u201d\nHowever, these improvements appear to come at a cost of lower \u201cSound Quality\u201d and \u201cClarity of Speech\u201d, as\nmeasured by the MOS protocol (Table 44). We explore the hypothesis that sensitivity to acoustic features (of\nspeaker vocal style and recordings), which allows the models to preserve high-level expressive characteristics,\nmay also make the models sensitive to unwanted artifacts located in source audio. To do so, we examine four\nacoustic measures of speech that are often used in studies of speech pathology and audio quality, namely the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), shimmer, and jitter.\n62\nFleurs\nmDRAL\nmExpresso\nID\nClar.\nNat.\nQual.\nClar.\nNat.\nQual.\nClar.\nNat.\nQual.\nX\u2013eng\nReference\n4.68\n4.79\n3.65\n4.48\n4.67\n4.58\n4.95\n4.52\n4.97\n5\n4.69\n3.85\n4.03\n4.63\n3.70\n4.21\n4.71\n3.87\n4.23\n4\n4.79\n3.82\n4.63\n4.82\n3.75\n4.58\n4.84\n4.02\n4.61\n3\n4.63\n4.27\n3.99\n4.59\n4.19\n4.09\n4.59\n4.16\n4.25\n2\n4.76\n4.32\n4.24\n4.85\n4.32\n4.52\n4.77\n4.27\n4.47\neng\u2013X\nReference\n4.36\n4.52\n4.00\n4.35\n4.61\n4.23\n4.40\n4.27\n4.24\n5\n2.98\n3.48\n2.34\n4.14\n3.68\n3.55\n4.03\n3.28\n3.58\n4\n3.56\n3.67\n2.97\n4.37\n3.82\n4.06\n4.29\n3.37\n4.32\n3\n2.94\n3.65\n2.36\n4.06\n4.00\n3.64\n4.02\n3.88\n3.77\n2\n4.34\n3.71\n4.39\n4.46\n3.70\n4.43\n4.42\n3.73\n4.49\nTable 45 - Human Evaluation results for MOS dimensions\u2014mean estimates (scale is 1-5).

Mean\ncorrelation values and confidence intervals estimated via bootstrap re-sampling with nb = 500.\nMeasuring noise-like characteristics in speech.\nSNR, HNR, jitter, and shimmer describe different aspects\nof speech\u2019s noise-like characteristics. SNR measures the energy ratio between speech and non-speech signal of\nan audio waveform. HNR measures the energy ratio between periodic and aperiodic components of the speech\nsignal. Higher values of SNR and HNR can generally be interpreted as less background noise (or cleaner audio)\nand less rough or hoarse-sounding speech (or a more stable speech signal), respectively. Jitter and shimmer\nmeasure pathological instability characteristics of vocalization. Specifically, jitter quantifies the instability of\nvocal fold vibration (pitch). Shimmer quantifies the instability of the amplitude of the speech waveform. High\njitter and high shimmer values are often interpreted as the speech sounding as if it is trembling and coarse\nsounding, respectively.24\nA comparison of the acoustic correlates of expressivity and noise.\nWe compute utterance-level SNR, HNR,\njitter, and shimmer for both source and target audio25 for our Expressivity comparison set (Figure 41). We\nanalyze the data in three ways. First, we examine the degree to which each of our systems preserves these\nacoustic characteristics by examining the correlation between measures for input source and output target\nspeech. Examining the correlation values gives us an indication of how well these characteristics are preserved\nby each model. Second, we compute the average difference between source and target values to measure the\ndegree to which the systems either reduce or amplify these characteristics. Third, we examine the overall\nrelationship between these acoustic features and MOS ratings for target outputs.\nAs shown in Figure 17, the correlation results indicate that all expressivity-preserving models preserve\nSNR, HNR, shimmer, and jitter from source audio to some extent, and significantly over what we see with\nSeamlessM4T v2 (for which target outputs are essentially independent of source inputs for these acoustic\ncharacteristics). In particular, HNR is preserved to the largest degree in models that make use of the\nPRETSSEL module (Models 3 and 5).\nIn addition, we examine the degree to which expressivity-preserving models reduce or amplify these acoustic\ncharacteristics. Interestingly, all models perform noise reduction to some degree, as measured by SNR.\nHowever, this effect is most pronounced in Model 2 (SeamlessM4T v2) and reduced in both Models 3 and\n5 (SeamlessM4T v2 +PRETSSEL and SeamlessExpressive) (gray bars of Figure 18). Of particular\nimport, the negative components of HNR, which are realized in more hoarse or breathy sounding speech, is\nactually increased (lower HNR values) in Models 3 and 5 (purple bars of Figure 18).\n24Jitter and Shimmer were computed using the openSMILE audio feature extraction toolkit (Eyben et al., 2010) (using the\neGeMAPSv02 feature set). HNR was computed using PRAAT implementation parselmouth (Jadoul et al., 2018). SNR was\ncomputed using an internal library.\n25For this analysis, we restrict ourselves to pairs for which both source- and target-audio had MOS ratings (reducing the total\nsample to n = 19233 items).\n64\nModel 2\nModel 3\nModel 4\nModel 5\nReference\n\u22122\n0\n2\n4\n6\nTarget-Source\nmean difference\nModel 2\nModel 3\nModel 4\nModel 5\nReference\nSNR\nHNR\nShimmer\nJitter\nTest MDRAL\nTest MEXPRESSO\nFigure 18 - The average difference between paired target and source audios for \u201cSNR\u201d, \u201cHNR\u201d, \u201cshimmer\u201d, and \u201cjitter\u201d\nvalues. Lower values for HNR indicate more perceived hoarseness in speaker speech, while higher HNR indicates less\nperceived hoarseness. Mean estimates and 95% CIs computed from nb = 500 bootstrap resampling.\nUp to this point, we have shown that the expressivity models uniquely preserve features of source audio\nin target outputs, and in the case of Models 3 and 5, aspects such as HNR are actually amplified. We\nnow examine the relation between noise-related features (SNR, HNR, shimmer, and jitter) on MOS ratings\nacross all model-based outputs. To do so, we extract item-level noise features and compute Spearman\u2019s\nRank correlation with MOS-ratings across the three dimensions \u201cClarity of Speech\u201d, \u201cSound Quality,\u201d and\n\u201cNaturalness\u201d (Figure 41).\nResults (Figure 19) indicate that HNR and SNR have a non-zero (positive) association with \u201cClarity of\nSpeech\u201d ratings while jitter and shimmer appear to have little relation. By contrast, we see that both shimmer\nand jitter have a substantial positive association with \u201cNaturalness\u201d\u2014presumably non-pathological amounts\nof these characteristics are seen as more human-like. Also, we see that HNR has a substantial negative\ncorrelation with \u201cNaturalness,\u201d meaning that as HNR increases, \u201cNaturalness\u201d actually declines. This is a\nsomewhat curious effect, but it may be similar to the finding for shimmer and jitter such that a small amount\nof breathiness or roughness may be seen as more natural, so long as that level is not pathological. Finally, we\nsee that both HNR and SNR have a substantial positive correlation with \u201cSound Quality\u201d such that higher\nHNR and SNR values result in higher sound quality ratings. To a small degree, both shimmer and jitter\ndisplay the opposite association.\nThis analysis, in the aggregate, provides converging evidence that in some cases (particularly Models 3 and\n5), sensitivity to the acoustic correlates of expressivity may also lead to sensitivity to noise-related acoustic\nfeatures (unless explicitly mitigated), leading to lower \u201cSound Quality\u201d and \u201cClarity of Speech\u201d ratings. These\nfindings are largely consistent with the architecture and training recipes for the current model set. For\nexample, in the case of Model 2 (SeamlessM4T v2), the speech-to-unit translation model is trained on a\nlarge amount of pseudo-labeled data with target units generated from a T2U model, and the unit vocoder\nis trained on a distribution of clean speech without any notion of the noisiness of the source speech during\ninference. By contrast, during training, the PRETSSEL module (Models 3 and 5) uses reference audio to\ncondition the Mel-filterbank feature distribution it models. During training, it inevitably associates noise\npatterns between the reference input and the target audio in the Mel-filterbank feature space (where noise is\nwell presented).\n7.3.5 Correlation between automatic metrics and human evaluation\nWe considered the relationship between automatically-derived expressive quality measures (as described in\nSection 7.1) and our Human Evaluation measures (as described in Section 7.3.1).26 We examined Spearman\n26Note this analysis is similar in spirit to the analysis presented in Section 7.1.\n65\nClarity of\nspeech\nNaturalness\nSound\nquality\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\nSpearman\u2019s \u03c1\nSNR\nHNR\nShimmer\nJitter\nFigure 19 - Relation of noise-related features (shimmer, jitter, hnr, snr) and MOS ratings (Clarity of Speech,\nNaturalness, and Sound Quality.

By contrast, the association is greatly\nreduced between expressive- and semantic-related measures28, which is expected. All pairwise correlations\ncan be viewed in Figure 42.\nOf particular interest is the strong correlation (\u03c1 = 0.796) between \u201cAutoPCP\u201d and the PCP\u2019s \u201cOverall\nExpressive Intent\u201d (OEI) dimension (Figure 20), as well as the correlation between both speech-rate and\npausing and PCP\u2019s rhythm dimension (\u03c1 = 0.771 and \u03c1 = 0.811, respectively). Strong associations between\nthese metrics provide an important sanity check of the validity of both types of measures. The fact that\nnearly all expressivity-related measures show strong association is not a surprise\u2013while the PCP elicits ratings\nindependently, expressive characteristics such as emotion, rhythm, and overall expressive intent naturally\nco-vary.29\n8. Responsible AI\nWarning: this section contains examples that may be offensive or upsetting in nature.\nTo build and develop our models in a responsible manner30, we worked on assessing and strengthening the\nsafety of our models in order to understand, quantify, and mitigate potential harms. To this end, we designed\nand developed one of the first known red-teaming efforts in multimodal machine translation research. This\ninitiative has allowed us to quantify the prevalence of certain types of critical errors. Then, we focused\non studying and mitigating toxicity by means of training a novel textless speech toxicity detector, MuTox,\nand using a recently developed tool, MinTox (Costa-juss`a et al., 2023a), for added toxicity mitigation at\ninference time. Subsequently, we quantified the amount of gender bias using the Multilingual HolisticBias\n27PCP: \u201crhythm\u201d, \u201cemotion\u201d and \u201coverall expressive intent\u201d; Automatic: \u201cAutoPCP\u201d, \u201cSpeaker-sim\u201d, \u201cSpeech-rate\u201d, \u201cSpeech-rate\n+ Pausing\u201d, \u201cPausing\u201d\n28PCP: \u201csemantics\u201d; Automatic: ASR-BLEU and BLEU\n29As a toy example, consider angry or agitated speech\u2013as a listener, the inference that the speaker is \u201cangry\u201d is likely in part a\nfunction of speech-rate (such that in many languages and cultures faster speech is seen as angrier).\n30https://ai.meta.com/blog/facebooks-five-pillars-of-responsible-ai/\n66\n2\n3\n4\n2.2\n2.5\n2.8\n3.1\nOEI\nAutoPCP\n2\n3\n4\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nRhythm\nPause durations\n2\n3\n4\n0.1\n0.3\n0.5\n0.7\nRhythm\nSpeech rate\nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish\nMandarin\nItalian\nEnglish\nSource language:\nMEXPRESSO\nMDRAL\nSpearman\n\u03c1=0.796\nSpearman\n\u03c1=0.811\nSpearman\n\u03c1=0.771\nFigure 20 - Human Evaluation (PCP) OEI and Rhythm correlations to AutoPCP, Pause durations, and Speech rate\nautomatic metrics.

Finally, we present our robust watermarking module, which digitally labels\nour outputs to prevent potential misuse of our systems.\n8.1 Red Teaming\nRed teaming aims to generate edge cases where a generative AI model produces harmful content. In this sense,\nred teaming is different from standard evaluations or dogfooding in that its purpose is less to assess the overall\nquality of models than to evaluate under what stress conditions models can break and generate irresponsible\noutputs\u2014e.g., outputs that impact user safety, misrepresent the level of input toxicity, or propagate various\nsocial biases.\nThere have been several red-teaming efforts for Large Language Models (LLMs) (Perez et al., 2022; Touvron\net al., 2023). However, we are unaware of previous red-teaming efforts for conditional generative AI and/or\nspeech models. While risks may be lower for conditional generation, and more specifically translation, where\nall sorts of outputs are permitted as long as they are faithful to their respective inputs, these models are still\naffected by a wide range of critical errors and hallucinations (Specia et al., 2021; Dale et al., 2023). While\nthese failure modes are less likely to occur, such less frequent occurrences can still be catastrophic (Reed,\n2020).\n8.1.1 Methods and implementation\nThe task of a red team explicitly consists of creating inputs (MT equivalent to prompts for LLMs) and assessing\nthe corresponding outputs for critical errors. In our case, we tested both text and speech outputs. In other\nwords, we are not only concerned with lexical semantics but also with the illocutionary and perlocutionary31\neffects of various speech components (e.g., prosody aspects, especially as they relate to conveyed sentiment).\nWe categorize critical errors as follows:\n1. Safety concerns. This could mean physical safety, such as loud saturated noises (more specific to speech\noutputs). The system should not produce outputs that can be a physical safety concern. This category\nalso includes deviation in material information (e.g., health, legal). In cases where the input contains\n31By illocutionary effect, we refer to the communicative impact of an utterance. Perlocutionary effect refers to the resulting\nimpact of the utterance on the recipient of the message.\n67\nhigh-stakes information, mistranslations could cause harm associated with heightened health or legal\nrisks. Such errors have to be avoided.\n2. Opposite sentiment (meaning or emotion). Models should not produce translations that convey the\nopposite meaning conveyed by the input (e.g., affirmations translated as negations, \"always\" translated\nas \"never\"). They should not produce translations expressed in the opposite manner (e.g., translations\nthat sound sad when the input sounds happy).\n3. Deviation in toxicity (added or deleted). When the input contains toxicity, models should be able to\nproduce similar toxicity in the output but not add toxicity to or delete toxicity from the output.\n4. Deviation in instructions. When the input contains instructions, models should not produce errors such\nthat if users were to follow the translated instructions, they would be facing risks.\n5. Named entity error. If the input contains named entities, models should not produce translation errors\nthat mislead by pointing to other existing entities.\n6. Deviation in numbers and units. Models should not mistranslate digits, numbers, or units, such as\nthose used in measurements, time, or date. Care should be taken here to dissociate translation from\nlocalization. Models should translate but they should not be expected to localize. For example, if the\ninput language conveys a distance in the form of a certain number of miles, the translation should show\nthe same number and the same unit (miles, as expressed in the output language), even if native speakers\nof the output language do not commonly use miles as a distance unit.\n7. Gender bias. Models are supposed to use all linguistic information available at the sentence level to\ninfer grammatical gender. If there is sufficient linguistic information to infer grammatical gender in a\nsentence, models should not produce translations with the wrong grammatical gender.\n8. Pitch bias. Input representation may be sensitive to pitch; therefore, different input pitch ranges may\nproduce slightly different translations. This being said, models should not produce more translation\nerrors for a particular pitch range than for others.\n9. Accent bias. Input representation may be sensitive to accents; therefore, different input accents may\nproduce slightly different translations. This being said, models should not produce more translation\nerrors for a particular accent than for others.\n10. Hallucination of personally identifiable information (PII). Long spans of hallucinated language are\na known translation model issue, especially in translation directions where parallel data are sparse.\nHowever, hallucinated content should never contain personally identifiable information (PII).\nBeyond these categories, we also encouraged red-teaming participants to uncover other critical error categories\nin order to reveal unknown unknowns.\nImplementation.\nWe conducted five one-hour red-teaming sessions with a total of 24 internal employees\nand designed a dedicated red-teaming interface for these employees, as well as 30 additional ones, to expand\ntheir red-teaming activity beyond the scheduled sessions. The participants needed to have a high level of\nproficiency in both English and one of the languages supported by the models. The models for which we\nreport red-teaming results here are SeamlessM4T v2 and SeamlessExpressive.\nParticipants were asked to produce input utterances using recipes that had shown prior efficacy in triggering\ncritical errors (see Table 47 for details). In addition, participants were instructed to test various manners of\nspeech, as reported in Table 48.\nPrior to being quantified at a more granular level, red team outputs were inspected by our team\u2019s linguists for\npotential mislabeling. Where miscategorization occurred, labels were corrected. For SeamlessM4T v2, our\nlinguists recategorized 64 labels, 25 of which from critical to non-critical categories. For SeamlessExpressive,\nour linguists recategorized 59 labels, 25 of which from critical to non-critical categories.\n68\nUtterance Recipe\nExamples\nSpecific demographics and groups of people\nWords that denote nationalities, ethnicities,\nprotected groups, occupations, etc.\nOut-of-vocabulary words\nNeologisms and blends (frunk, goblintimacy,\nsharenting, bossware), technical terms,\narchaic words, infrequent named entities, etc.\nTongue twisters or alliterative language\nBetty Botter bought a bit of butter but . . .\nNumbers/units of measurement/date/time\n67%, 2023, 2:30pm, 90 km/h, etc.\nWords including toxic-sounding subwords\nUranus, Maine Coon, niggardly, etc.\nClear references to grammatical gender\nMy boss is very fair to her employees.\nVery short/long and structurally complex utterances\nInterjections or long and complex sentences\nHealth, safety, or legal matters\nDisclaimers, information related to\nmedication, caution signs, etc.\nTable 47 - Red Team recipes\nManners of speech\nVery fast or slow speech\nLong pauses between speech segments\nUnnatural pauses between speech segments\nVery loud or very quiet voice\nVery happy or angry expression\nDifferent accents (if possible)\nDelivery including many gap fillers\nMixing any number of the above manners of speech\nTable 48 - Red Team manners of speech\n8.1.2 Findings for SeamlessM4T v2\nWe collected 438 analyzable records (444 records in total, six of which were test prompts, and only 301 had\na speech output). Table 49 shows the breakdown per category and modality. The drill mainly included\nchallenges for out-of-English and into-English directions in nine languages (arb, cmn, fra, hin, ita, rus, spa,\nand ukr).\nCritical errors in toxicity are by far the most prevalent in both modalities. However, it is important to note\nthat only approximately 25% of toxicity instances constitute added toxicity, while 48% of instances show\ndeleted toxicity, and the remaining instances can be best categorized as toxicity that varies in intensity.\n8.1.3 Findings for SeamlessExpressive\nWe collected 1,168 records, two of which were test prompts. A breakdown per category is available in Table 50.\nThe drill mainly included challenges for out-of-English and into-English directions in four languages (deu,\nfra, spa, and ita). As is the case for SeamlessM4T v2, we find that the most prevalent category for\nSeamlessExpressive is toxicity (on average 4.2% of all challenges and 27.5% of all successful ones), and\nwe note that approximately 28% of toxicity instances constitute deleted toxicity, 56% added toxicity, and\nthe remaining instances can be best categorized as toxicity that varies in intensity. We should also note\nthat participants did not necessarily use the same toxicity-triggering prompts for SeamlessExpressive as\nthey did for SeamlessM4T v2, which does not allow a direct comparison between models. The next most\nprevalent category is deviations in numbers, units, or dates/time.\nAdded Toxicity Mitigation.\nTo mitigate added toxicity, a technique such as MinTox (Costa-juss`a et al.,\n2023a) (described in Section 8.2.2) could be applied.\n69\nCategory\nspeech\ntext\nSafety concern\n2\n4\nincluding deviation in material information\n2\n1\nOpposite sentiment\n5\n11\nToxicity\n22\n35\nDeviation in instructions\n6\n8\nNamed entity\n6\n8\nDeviation in numbers\n7\n14\nGender bias\n10\n13\nPitch bias\n0\n\u2013\nAccent bias\n1\n\u2013\nPII hallucination\n0\n0\nTotal\n59\n93\nTotal number of challenges\n301\n438\nTable 49 - Red Team results for SeamlessM4T v2\nCategory\nspeech\ntext\nSafety concern\n10\n9\nincluding deviation in material information\n7\n\u2013\nOpposite sentiment\n22\n15\nToxicity\n47\n50\nDeviation in instructions\n19\n19\nNamed entity\n17\n17\nDeviation in numbers\n41\n33\nGender bias\n25\n25\nPitch bias\n2\n\u2013\nAccent bias\n2\n\u2013\nPII hallucination\n0\n0\nTotal\n185\n168\nTotal number of challenges\n1,168\n1,168\nTable 50 - Red Team results for SeamlessExpressive\nSummary.\nWe contribute a new methodology for red teaming in the context of conditional generative AI\nin a multimodal and multilingual context, and quantify successful challenges for SeamlessM4T v2 and\nSeamlessExpressive.\n8.2 Toxicity\nWarning: This section contains language that can be upsetting or offensive.\nFollowing the section above, we focus on one particular type of critical error: toxicity. Toxicity is being defined\nin various ways in the literature, e.g. it could be defined as language that induces or communicates harm,\nnegativity, or hate (Gehman et al., 2020; Costa-juss`a et al., 2023b). While the concept may be extremely\nbroad, we define language that qualifies as toxic later in Section 8.2.1. In the case of translation, we focus on\nthe problem of added toxicity, which consists of introducing toxicity to the output while no toxic content was in\nthe input (see examples in Table 55). To better grasp this phenomenon, we first present the toxicity detection\ntool that we use from previous work, ETOX (Seamless Communication et al., 2023), and an additional tool\nwe propose in this paper\u2014MuTox. Then, we present the added toxicity mitigation techniques deployed in our\nsystems (Costa-juss`a et al., 2023a). Finally, we quantify the amount of added toxicity in our models.\n70\n8.2.1 Speech toxicity detection tools\nSimilar to previous works (NLLB Team et al., 2022; Seamless Communication et al., 2023), we used a\nword-based toxicity detector, ETOX (Costa-juss`a et al., 2023b), a tool that works for 200 languages. An\nalternative to this metric is context-based classifiers that are able to detect beyond lexical toxicity. An example\nof this class of classifiers is Detoxify32, which covers eight languages33. While these detectors have been\noriginally designed for text, they can be applied to speech when combined with ASR, effectively creating a\ncascading system (Seamless Communication et al., 2023). Beyond cascade detection tools, end-to-end speech\ntoxicity classification has been investigated in Ghosh et al. (2021), which offers an English-centric dataset\ntogether with end-to-end toxicity detection results.\nTextless speech detection has the advantage of not depending on an ASR module, where quality varies based\non the language. More importantly, textless systems may be able to capture toxicity beyond text, including\ntoxicity conveyed with particular prosody, intonation, or emotion in speech signals. These factors motivated\nus to build a speech dataset on which we can train and test speech toxicity detection without depending solely\non text.\nDataset.\nWe collected our data from existing English sources such as Detoxy (Ghosh et al., 2021) and\nJigSaw (cjadams et al., 2017). Given the scarcity of speech-annotated data, we also annotated data to\ncreate the MuTox corpus. Data to annotate was pre-selected on the automatically aligned data in this work\n(Section 3.1.1). We annotated a total of 20,000 utterances for English (21 hours) and Spanish (22 hours),\nand 4,000 utterances (120 hours) for many high-priority (HP) languages in the context of this work34. We\ndesigned clear guidelines for toxicity annotation, which include definitions of what qualified for toxicity:\n\u2022 Profanities, including slurs and language that are regarded as obscene, repulsive, vulgar, or scatological.\nExamples of profanities in English include words such as shit, asshole, fucking, etc.\n\u2022 Hate speech constitutes language used to demean, disparage, belittle, or insult groups of people. Hate\nspeech in English includes words and expressions such as towelheads, wetbacks, kikes, Republicunts,\nLibtards, women are sluts, men are trash, etc.\n\u2022 Pornographic language is words or phrases that refer to sexual acts or body parts associated with\nsexuality. Examples of pornographic language include terms such as blowjob, cumshot, fuckface, dirty\nSanchez, rusty trombone, pussy, suck my dick, gangbang, etc.\n\u2022 Physical violence or bullying language is language used to bully, threaten, and silence individuals.\nExamples of such language include words or expressions such as bastard, son of a bitch, I will kill you,\nshut the fuck up, etc.\nWe outsourced the annotation of toxic language to native speakers. Statistics with the number of utterances\nand the corresponding toxicity rates in all the speech toxicity labeled datasets used in this work are reported\nin Table 51.\nMethodology.\nWe fed our toxicity classifier, MuTox, with both speech toxicity and text toxicity labeled data.\nThe speech toxicity classifier follows a simple architecture consisting of encoding the input into a fixed-size\nrepresentation vector (different for each language and modality) and a binary classifier which consists of three\nfeed-forward layers, a sigmoid function, and binary cross entropy with logit loss. See diagram in Figure 21.\nImplementation.\nWe used multimodal and multilingual SONAR encoders (Duquenne et al., 2023b), which\nare available in all of our languages of interest (English, Spanish, and HP languages). For the classifier, we\nused variable input sizes for the three feedforward layers (1024, 512, and 128). Moreover, we used Binary\nCross Entropy loss with logits and Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001. In order to compare\nzero-shot (ZS) vs supervised performance, we trained the classifier with English and Spanish training data and\nthen tested HP languages in zero-shot mode. To test supervised performance for HP languages, we trained\n32https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify\n33English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, French, German, and Turkish\n34Bengali, Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, Portuguese,\nRussian, Swahili, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, and Vietnamese\n71\nSubset\nLanguage\nModality\nDataset\nSize\nToxicity\nDev\nEng\nSpeech\nMuTox\n973\n162\nSpa\n981\n195\nHP\n250\n5-60\nDevtest\nEng\nSpeech\nMuTox\n1945\n324\nSpa\n1960\n390\nHP\n750\n10-180\nTest\nEng\nSpeech\nMuTox\n2918\n486\nSpa\n2918\n486\nHP\n1140-1480\n15-362\nTable 51 - Speech utterances specified by dataset subset.

In our experiments, we used Whisper-Large-v2\nto transcribe speech. To evaluate our classifier, we use AUC, Precision, and Recall. We compare performance\nwith ETOX (Costa-juss`a et al., 2023b) and Detoxify (Hanu and Unitary team, 2020) as primary text-based\ntoxicity tools. ETOX is chosen for offering the widest coverage (200 languages) in toxicity detection. Detoxify\nis chosen for being one of the available tools with the highest performance in several JigSaw benchmarks with\na single model (Thewlis et al., 2021).\nResults.\nTable 52 compares MuTox and ASR-Detoxify (for available languages) in terms of AUC. MuTox\nis able to extend the coverage of ASR-Detoxify (potentially by more than 10 times when using SONAR\nembeddings and zero-shot) while providing a slight quality improvement (over 1%) when compared on the 8\nlanguages covered by Detoxify. Supervised MuTox improves zero-shot MuTox by more than 7% on average.\nWhen comparing MuTox and ASR-MuTox averaging over 21 languages, results are comparable for supervised\ntraining. While it is unclear why MuTox vs. ASR-MuTox show different results depending on the language,\nwe could hypothesize that the imbalances in the complexities of pronunciation/writing in various languages\nlead to variations of ASR quality. Note that zero-shot MuTox outperforms on average zero-shot ASR-MuTox.\nTable 53 compares MuTox and ASR-ETOX in terms of recall at fixed precision. ASR-MuTox with a fixed\nprecision of max(ASR-ETOX, 0.3) (meaning 0.32 average precision) improves recall by almost 30% on\naverage. ASR-MuTox recall (at fixed precision) is higher than when using non-cascade MuTox directly on\nspeech (by >8%).\nKey Findings.\nWe built MuTox, an end-to-end speech and text toxicity classifier, and a new 21-language\nspeech toxicity dataset and benchmark.

On the one hand, we filtered training pairs with imbalance\ntoxicity as reported in Section 3.1.2. On the other hand, we performed added toxicity mitigation at inference\ntime by using MinTox (Costa-juss`a et al., 2023a). In particular, the main workflow generates a translation\nhypothesis with an unconstrained search. Then, the toxicity classifier is run on this hypothesis. If no toxicity\nis detected, we provide the translation hypothesis as it is. However, if toxicity is detected in the output, we\nrun the classifier on the input. If the toxicity is unbalanced, i.e., no toxicity is detected in the input, we re-run\nthe translation with mitigation, which is the BeamFiltering step. This BeamFiltering consists of taking\nas input the multi-token expressions that should not appear in the output and excluding them from the beam\nsearch hypotheses. Note that we do not apply mitigation in cases where there is toxicity in the input (in other\nwords, we do not deal with cases where there is toxicity in the input but more toxicity in the output). The\nMinTox algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2.\n8.2.3 Added toxicity in SeamlessM4T v2\nIn this section, we report added toxicity in the tasks of S2TT and S2ST for SeamlessM4T v2 with and\nwithout MinTox and compared to SOTA models (SeamlessM4T-Large) in terms of added toxicity (Seamless\nCommunication et al., 2023). We computed added toxicity at the sentence level and the results are shown as\nthe proportion of sentences with added toxicity divided by the total number of sentences. We used ETOX/\nASR-ETOX and the MuTox metrics as previously described. With ETOX, a sentence has added toxicity if\ntoxic phrases are larger in the target than in the source language. With MuTox, a sentence has added toxicity\n73\nlanguage\nASR-ETOX\nMuTox-ZS\nASR-MuTox-ZS\nMuTox\nASR-MuTox\nPrecision\nRecall\nRecall\nRecall\nRecall\nRecall\neng\n0.40\n0.31\n-\n-\n0.18\n0.49\nspa\n0.41\n0.33\n-\n-\n0.19\n0.44\narb\n0.18\n0.03\n0.26\n0.15\n0.58\n0.64\nben\n0.01\n0.02\n0.11\n0.03\n0.40\n0.37\ncmn\n0.00\n0.00\n0.37\n0.17\n0.32\n0.13\ndeu\n0.43\n0.37\n0.79\n0.80\n0.91\n0.90\nfra\n0.10\n0.40\n0.31\n0.14\n0.62\n0.58\nhin\n0.09\n0.01\n0.36\n0.33\n0.77\n0.86\nind\n0.12\n0.30\n0.19\n0.18\n0.43\n0.39\nita\n0.18\n0.32\n-\n0.18\n0.12\n0.33\nkor\n0.00\n0.02\n-\n-\n-\n-\nnld\n0.06\n0.11\n0.73\n0.21\n0.88\n0.56\npor\n0.28\n0.45\n0.69\n0.77\n0.67\n0.75\nrus\n0.18\n0.46\n0.42\n0.52\n0.43\n0.69\nswh\n0.07\n0.17\n0.02\n0.06\n-\n-\ntgl\n0.14\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.34\n-\ntha\n0.00\n0.00\n-\n0.07\n-\n-\ntur\n0.01\n0.13\n-\n0.12\n0.37\n0.47\nvie\n0.10\n0.16\n0.69\n0.61\n0.77\n0.60\nAverage\n0.15\n0.19\n-\n-\n0.50\n0.55\nTable 53 - Toxicity detection precision and recall results.

When compared with predecessors with\nlower coverage, it increases coverage (potentially by 10 times) while improving performance (by 1%\non AUC).

(2023). In terms of evaluation metrics for\nS2TT, we used chrFas reported in Appendix H.Similarly to Seamless Communication et al. (2023), instead of\nusing BLEU as the quality metric, we used chrFbecause it is more equipped to handle shorter utterances,\nwhich better suits the evaluation of the Multilingual HolisticBias dataset. This dataset is relatively small\n(325 utterances) and with short sentences (on average, six words per utterance) (Costa-juss`a et al., 2023). For\nS2ST, we used ASR-chrF35 .36 and Blaser 2.0 (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) 37 For the eng\u2013X\ndirection, we include languages that overlap between the languages from the generated TTS data and the\nlanguages available in our S2ST model. Additionally, since MMS-TTS generations are not deterministic, we\nrepeated the measurements three times for both S2ST and S2TT. The final metric values are then averaged\nto ensure robustness and accuracy in our evaluations.\nModels.\nWe compared SeamlessM4T v2 with SeamlessM4T-Large. In this case, and based on the\ncomparable results in terms of gender bias obtained in Seamless Communication et al. (2023), additional\ncomparison was done for X\u2013eng S2TT with Whisper-Large-v2 (Radford et al., 2022). For X\u2013eng S2ST, we\nused YourTTS (Casanova et al., 2022) to generate synthesized speech from the output of Whisper-Large-\nv2 S2TT. As for eng\u2013X S2TT, we used a cascaded system: ASR from Whisper-Large-v2 (Radford et al.,\n2022), followed by T2TT via NLLB-3.3B (NLLB Team et al., 2022).\nResults.\nTable 56 presents the average scores per gender and the comparison with the corresponding baselines.\n\u2206corresponds to the relative variation between genders computed as follows:\n\u2206= \u03c9(M \u2212F)/\u03c9(min(M, F)), \u03c9 \u2208{chrF, ASR-chrF, Blaser 2.0}.\nIn eng\u2013X, we evaluated translations from neutral to gendered forms and observed the overgeneralization\ntowards masculine gender. For example, the neutral English sentence I\u2019m a Confucianist. was translated into\nJe suis un confucianiste., a masculine form. Ideally, it should be translated into a neutral form Je suis une\npersonne confucianiste. Focusing solely on the results, we noticed that this overgeneralization is higher than\nSeamlessM4T-Large model in terms of chrFand ASR-chrF. Overgeneralization is comparable in terms of\nBlaser 2.0.\nIn X\u2013eng, we evaluated the robustness of translating content that only differs in their gender inflection. To\ngive an example, the same sentence in Spanish Tengo amigas que son personas zoroastrianas. in its masculine\nform is translated to I have friends who are Austrian people. and the same sentence in Spanish Tengo amigas\nque son personas zoroastrianas. in its feminine form is translated to I have friends who are Romanian people.\nIn this case, neither of the translations are correct because the outputs should have said I have friends who\nare Zoroastrian people.. However, in this case, the translation should not have produced different adjectives\njust by changing the gender. For S2TT, we noticed that the difference in performance between the masculine\nand feminine forms is more pronounced for overgeneralization than for robustness. But this is not the case\nwhen evaluating S2ST with Blaser 2.0. Turning our attention to the performance comparison, we find that\nwhen it comes to robustness, SeamlessM4T v2 is equal or better to all baseline systems in all metrics. There\nis a higher percentage gap in ASR-chrF than for Blaser 2.0. This may imply that ASR (from ASR-chrF)\nadds extra biases.\nKey Findings.\nSeamlessM4T v2 consistently improves robustness in gender variations across metrics and\ntasks. When compared to the previous model, SeamlessM4T v2 improves over SeamlessM4T-Large by\n0.4% in S2TT and by 0.1% Blaser 2.0 in S2ST, and it beats the external baseline system of Whisper-\nLarge-v2 (+YourTTS) by 0.1% in S2TT and by 0.9% Blaser 2.0 for S2ST. However, SeamlessM4T v2\nis not able to consistently improve in terms of gender overgeneralization compared to the previous model.\nSeamlessM4T v2 is comparable in terms of Blaser 2.0 to SeamlessM4T-Large, but it lags far behind\nin terms of ASR-chrF (by 2.2%), and overgeneralization is increased by 0.2% when it comes to S2TT. While\n35We included only 18 languages: arb,bul,cat,deu,ell,eng,fra,lvs,mar,nld,por,ron,rus,spa,swe,tha,ukr,urd.\n36The transcription is done by Whisper-Large-v2. chrFhas been calculated the same way as S2TT except that in S2ST, the\ntext from both prediction and reference are normalized.\n37We included only 14 languages: arb,cat,deu,eng,fra,nld,por,ron,rus,spa,swe,tha,ukr,urd.\n78\neng\u2013X\nSeamlessM4T v2/SeamlessM4T-Large/WL (+ YourTTS)\nFeminine Source\nMasculine Source\n\u2206\u2193%\nS2TT\nchrF\n45.2/45.0/47.4\n50.2/49.9/52.7\n11.1/10.9/11.2\nS2ST\nASR-chrF\n45.6/38.4\n50.4/41.6\n10.5/8.3\nBlaser 2.0\n3.7/3.5\n3.7/3.5\n0.0/0.0\nX\u2013eng\nSeamlessM4T v2/SeamlessM4T-Large/WL (+ YourTTS)\nFeminine Source\nMasculine Source\n\u2206\u2193%\nS2TT\nchrF\n54.2/52.4/50.4\n56.0/54.3/52.1\n3.3/3.7/3.4\nS2ST\nASR-chrF\n56.1/52.7/52.1\n58.0/54.5/53.9\n3.4/3.4/3.5\nBlaser 2.0\n3.7/3.6/2.8\n3.8/3.7/2.9\n2.7/2.8/3.6\nTable 56 - The averaged points across modalities and genders for assessing the overgeneralization (eng\u2013X) and the\nrobustness (X\u2013eng). \u2206represents the relative difference between masculine and feminine\n(\u2206= \u03c9(M \u2212F)/\u03c9(min(M, F)), \u03c9 \u2208{chrF, ASR-chrF, Blaser 2.0}). We abbreviate Whisper-Large-v2 as WL.\nwe can increase bias robustness by improving the overall quality of the model, it seems that we need specific\ntechniques to counteract the overgeneralization of the model towards one specific gender.\n8.4 Localized Watermarking\nThe ability to replicate and manipulate voices with high fidelity has far-reaching implications for the fields\nof cybersecurity and the trustworthiness of information. To counter possible abuses, one approach involves\ntraining binary classifiers, as seen in studies by\n(Borsos et al., 2023; Kharitonov et al., 2023; Le et al.,\n2023). These binary classifiers are trained to detect synthesized audio from authentic real ones. However,\nthis passive detection approach has significant drawbacks. As generative models advance and the produced\ncontent becomes increasingly realistic, the accuracy of these classifiers will progressively decrease. Eventually,\ndistinguishing between authentic and synthesized content could become an extremely difficult, if not impossible,\nchallenge. For instance, Le et al. (2023) point out that their classifier mainly recognizes artifacts produced\nby their model. For the same reasons, detectors cannot distinguish between different models, diluting the\nresponsibility and accountability of the different actors. At the same time, regulators and governments (see\nChi (2023); Eur (2023); USA (2023)) are starting to double down on measures to improve transparency and\ntraceability in AI-generated content.\nWe opt for using watermarking as a key strategy for tracing the provenance of AI-generated content (Kirchen-\nbauer et al., 2023; Fernandez et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a). Watermarking employs a\ntechnique where an undetectable signal is embedded into the audio, which, although imperceptible to human\nears, can be easily recognized by specialized algorithms. This signal can be used to detect if a speech is\nAI-generated and to identify the specific models used to generate it.\nMost current watermarking methods consider the input audio as a whole indivisible unit when determining if\nthe entire audio is watermarked or not. However, in real-world scenarios, an audio clip often contains a mix of\nwatermarked and non-watermarked parts, in particular in scenarios when synthesized speech is embedded\nWatermark \nGenerator\nWatermarked\nAI-Generated speech \nWatermark \nDetector\nMalicious \nattacker\nProactive detection through watermarking \nSeamlessM4T\nPublished speech\n\u2714\n\u2717\n\u2018AI generated?\u2019\nFigure 26 - Proactive detection through watermarking.\n79\nwithin a larger audio track. This issue is also present in passive detection methods (Le et al., 2023). Chen\net al. (2023a) address this issue by embedding the watermark across one-second intervals within the input\naudio. For detection, they adopt a brute force approach, sliding through the audio and attempting decoding a\nwatermark starting at each frame. This makes the watermark detection slow and inefficient and constrains\nthe resolution of watermarking to audios larger than one second. Moreover, current watermarking systems are\ndeveloped for steganography rather than for detection. They are engineered to hide a binary message (such as\n32-128 bits) (Liu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a) that initially focuses on intellectual property protection\nrather than tracing provenance or detecting AI-generated content, this overcomplicates the generator and\ndetector architectures.\nIn the development of our SeamlessWM model, we have alleviated those limitations by specifically tailoring\nit for detection purposes drawing conceptual alignments with Juvela and Wang (2023)\u2019s approach. Unlike\nthe state-of-the-art methods for audio watermarking (Chen et al., 2023a) which allows a resolution of\ngeneration/detection of only one second, SeamlessWM introduces a significant advancement by enabling the\nidentification of AI-generated audio segments with a precise frame level resolution.\n8.4.1 Methodology\nAs illustrated in Figure 27 we jointly trained a generator and a detector. The watermarked generator aims to\nembed a watermark into an audio signal, while the detector aims to detect the watermark at each frame, even\nin the presence of augmentations.\nTraining pipeline.\nWe can identify three main steps:\n(i) The watermark generator takes as input a waveform s \u2208Rt and outputs a watermark waveform \u03b4w \u2208Rt,\nwhere t is the number of frames.\n(ii) As a first augmentation that happens with probability 0.5, k windows of the watermark are randomly\ndropped (\u03b4w is set to 0 at these locations). They cover approximately 50% of the total watermark and are\nbuilt by randomly sampling k starting points and dropping the subsequent t/2k frames. The remaining\nwatermark signal is added to the original audio to produce a watermarked audio sw = s + \u03b4w. Then, a\nnoise layer randomly applies with probability 0.5 the following augmentations to the watermarked audio:\nbandpass filter, boost audio, duck audio, echo, highpass filter, lowpass filter, pink noise, gaussian noise,\nslower, smooth, resample. The noise layer helps to improve the watermark\u2019s robustness to audio editing,\nwhile dropping windows of the watermark greatly helps for localization.\n(iii) Both the watermarked and original signals are processed through the detector D. For both of them D\noutputs a soft decision at every frame, meaning D(s) \u2208[0, 1]t. The detector outputs are illustrated in\nFigure 27, where we observe that detection happens (D(s) > 0.5) only when the watermark is present.\nLosses.\nThe training minimizes a weighted combination of two losses. The perceptual loss ensures the\nwatermark is imperceptible. It is computed between the original and watermarked audio, as the sum of\nthe Scale Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SI-SNR) and the L1 loss. On the other hand, the localization\n  Detection Loss\nWatermark \nGenerator\nWatermarked\nOriginal\nAugmented\nWatermark \nDetector\nPerceptual loss\nFigure 27 - (Left) Generator-detector training pipeline. (Right) A speech signal, its predicted watermark (green\nwaveform), and detector frame-wise output. A green background color indicates the presence of the watermark.\n80\nloss ensures robust detection on watermarked audio frames. When the drop augmentation is applied, it is\ncomputed as the binary cross entropy between the detector output (followed by a sigmoid layer) and a binary\nmask indicating the presence of the watermark. When it is not applied, the loss is computed over both the\noriginal and watermarked audio, and the label is set respectively to 1 and 0.\nArchitectures.\nThe watermark generator (Figure 28) comprises two main components: an encoder and a\ndecoder using main building blocks from (D\u00b4efossez et al., 2022)\u2019s. The encoder model is constructed with a\n1D convolution with 32 channels and a kernel size of 7, followed by 4 convolution blocks. Each convolution\nblock consists of a singular residual unit succeeded by a down-sampling layer. This down-sampling layer\nemploys a strided convolution with a kernel size K equal to twice the stride S. The residual unit encompasses\ntwo convolutions with a kernel size of 3 along with a skip-connection. Additionally, the number of channels is\ndoubled whenever down-sampling occurs. Subsequently, the convolution blocks are succeeded by a two-layer\nLSTM for sequence modeling and finish in a final 1D convolution layer with a kernel size of 7 and 128 output\nchannels. The chosen parameter values for strides S are (2, 4, 5, 8). The non-linear activation function is\nELU. The decoder mirrors the encoder but employs transposed convolutions instead of strided convolutions,\nand the strides in the decoder are applied in the reverse order.\nThe detector consists of an encoder and a last block made of a transposed convolution and a linear layer. The\nencoder shares the same architecture as the one from the generator (but does not share the same weights). The\ntransposed convolution has eight output channels and upsamples the activation map to the same resolution as\nthe original audio, which results in an activation map with t \u00d7 8 channels. The linear layer converts the eight\ndimensions into two, followed by a softmax to have a probability decision at each frame.\nExperimental details.\nWe trained our models on 4.5k-hour speech data. This was done on 400k steps, with\nthe Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 3e-4, and a batch size of 32. We used a sampling rate of 16 kHz and 1s\nsamples, so t = 16000 in our training. For the drop augmentation, we used k = 5 windows of t/10 frames.\nThe weights of the perceptual and localization loss were set to 10 and 1.\n8.4.2 Experiments & Results\nIn the following, the results are averaged over 10k samples of 10s from our VoxPopuli validation set unless\notherwise specified.\nMetrics.\nTo evaluate the quality of the watermarked audio, we used the SI-SNR defined as SI-SNR(s, sw) =\n10 log10\n\u0000\u2225\u03b1s\u22252\n2/\u2225\u03b1s \u2212sw\u22252\n2\n\u0001\n, where \u03b1 = \u27e8s, sw\u27e9/\u2225s\u22252\n2.\nTo evaluate the quality of the detection, we used True Positive Rate (TPR), i.e., the proportion of watermarked\ncontent that is correctly identified, the False Positive Rate (FPR), i.e., the proportion of genuine content\nincorrectly flagged as watermarked, and accuracy.\n\u2717  \u2714 \nConv 1D\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nConv 1D\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nEncoder\nConv Transpose 1D \nConv 1D\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nConv 1D\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nConv 1D\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nResNet Conv block\nConv 1D\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nEncoder\nDecoder\nWatermark Generator \nWatermark Detector  (localized)\nFigure 28 - Architectures of the watermark generator and detector.\n81\nTo evaluate the localization task, we used frame accuracy, i.e., the proportion of audio frames correctly labeled,\nand the Intersection over Union (IoU). The latter is defined as the intersection between the predicted and\nthe ground truth detection masks (1 when the frame is watermarked, 0 otherwise), divided by their union:\nIoU(D(s), gt)=|D(s) \u2229gt|/|D(s) \u222agt|.\nQuality and detection results.\nWe first compare detection between active and passive detection using the\nVoiceBox classifier. As done in VoiceBox, we masked frames in the spectrogram corresponding to 90%, 50%,\nand 30% of the phonemes of the utterance before VoiceBox generation. We applied SeamlessWM after\ngeneration, so the main difference between lines is the distribution of negative samples (AI-generated without\nwatermark). Table 57 highlights that pro-active detection allows for much better detection of synthetic speech\nthan traditional detection, with perfect detection over all the studied samples.\nSeamlessWM (Ours)\nVoiceBox Classif.\n% Mask\nAccuracy\nPrecision\nRecall\nAccuracy\nPrecision\nRecall\nOriginal audio vs AI-generated audio\n30%\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n50%\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n90%\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\nRe-synthesized audio vs AI-generated audio\n30%\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.704\n0.714\n0.680\n50%\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.809\n0.796\n0.831\n90%\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.907\n0.881\n0.942\nTable 57 - Comparison with VoiceBox binary classifier.\nWe further compared SeamlessWM to the concurrent deep watermarking method WavMark.

Compared to WavMark,\nwe obtained better or similar detection results, with consistently better audio quality.

Whenever a watermarked window is detected, we\nlabeled the 16k frames of the window as watermarked, and we ended up with a detection mask in {0, 1}t.\nWe plot in Figure 29 the mean frame accuracy and IoU of SeamlessWM and WavMark for different\nproportions of watermarked speech into the non-watermarked speech. Our approach achieves an impressive\nIoU of 0.99 when just one second of speech is AI-manipulated, compared to WavMark\u2019s 0.35. SeamlessWM\nallows for precise detection of minor audio alterations: it can pinpoint AI-generated segments in audio down to\nthe frame level (1/16k secs), while the concurrent WavMark only provides one-second resolution and therefore\nlags behind in terms of IoU. This is especially relevant for speech samples, where a simple word modification\nmay greatly change meaning.\n9. Social Impact & Conclusion\nIn this work, we contribute a family of models (i.e., SeamlessM4T v2, SeamlessExpressive, and Seam-\nlessStreaming) designed to provide end-to-end multilingual, expressive, and streaming translations, marking\na pivotal step towards naturalistic S2ST. First, SeamlessM4T v2, an improved version of SeamlessM4T, is\nthe foundational multilingual and multimodal model on which the latter two models are initialized. Seamless-\nExpressive enables translation that preserves prosody and the style of one\u2019s voice, and SeamlessStreaming\nleverages the Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA) mechanism to generate low-latency target\ntranslations without waiting for complete source utterances. To evaluate these models, we combined novel and\nmodified versions of existing metrics to evaluate performance and robustness. Taking a four-pronged approach\nto ensure the safety of our systems, we implemented the first known red-teaming effort for multimodal machine\ntranslation, an added-toxicity detection and mitigation system, evaluations for gender bias, and an inaudible\nlocalized watermarking mechanism designed to dampen the impact of deepfakes. Consequently, we bring\nSeamlessExpressive, and SeamlessStreaming together as Seamless, the first publicly available system\nthat unlocks expressive cross-lingual communication in real time.\n9.1 Naturalistic Translations & Experiential Futures\nThe downstream applications our family of models may give rise to could meaningfully transform how\ncross-lingual communication and experiences manifest across online and offline contexts. While recognizing\nthat these technical building blocks could be combined to enable a smorgasbord of experiences, we briefly\nexplore some potential recipes below.\nTo start, here are a few ways to use our unified system\u2014Seamless:\n\u2022 Audio or video-calling. Integrating our models into computer-mediated communication applications\nor other voice or video-calling platforms would enable real-time and expressive multilingual dialogue.\nFor such an experience, a user could select their desired output language, and every utterance in\nthat call made by any speaker would be translated into the pre-determined target language. With\n83\nexpressive translations, listeners should not have trouble differentiating who said what. Moreover,\nbecause SeamlessM4T v2 supports both speech and text modalities, users should also be able to see\nlive captions alongside speech outputs.\n\u2022 Augmented or virtual reality (AR/VR) environments. Akin to the use case above, Seamless could\nsupport multi-person cross-lingual interactions in AR/VR environments, be it multiplayer games or\nconference meetings.\n\u2022 Online streaming. Seamless can also be adapted to run locally on users\u2019 personal computers. Through\na simple interface, one could use the model to listen to and render translated audio outputs to a virtual\nstream. This would allow users to speak in any language on their streaming platforms.\n\u2022 Wearable devices: earbuds or smart glasses. To create the first generation of a real-world Universal\nSpeech Translator, Seamless could be integrated into earbuds, smart glasses, or comparable wearable\ndevices of a similar nature. Today, most earbuds and smart glasses come with compact microphone and\nspeaker systems, which could easily facilitate receiving and producing speech input and output. If every\ninterlocutor in a conversation is equipped with a Seamless-supported device, all parties can speak in\nwhatever language they want and remain comprehensible. Additionally, live captions (as supported by\nSeamlessM4T v2) could also be displayed on lenses of smart glasses for boosted accessibility and user\nconfidence.\nBeyond these synchronous use cases, our models could also be used for making passive content consumption\nmore inclusive:\n\u2022 Translations for voice-messaging platforms. Today, instead of exclusively relying on texts, many people\nrecord audio notes on computer-mediated communication platforms like WhatsApp or Messenger to\nget their messages across. SeamlessM4T v2 and SeamlessExpressive can support not just the\ntranslation of these audio notes, they can do so while preserving prosody and the style of one\u2019s voice.\n\u2022 Long-form audio translation pipeline. Our models could be incorporated into a larger audio processing\npipeline to translate long-form audio content such as lectures or podcasts.\nBy first isolating the\nvoice audio (i.e., removing all music, background noise, and sound effects), the resulting clips can be\nprocessed independently by our models before being brought back together to form a fully expressive\nand multilingual product.\n\u2022 Video dubbing translation pipeline. Building on the abovementioned pipeline, combining our models with\na video dubbing tool [e.g., Wav2Lip (Prajwal et al., 2020)] could streamline the creation of multilingual\nvideo content that is of high quality both on the visual and audible fronts.\nOverall, the multidimensional experiences Seamless may engender could lead to a step change in how\nmachine-assisted cross-lingual communication is accomplished. For the immigrant interviewees featured in\nSection 2, the communicative capabilities Seamless affords may unlock new possibilities in their personal\nand professional lives. In the near future, with the help of Seamless, everyday communication that once\nappeared challenging may become ordinary. While not a panacea for social integration, giving them a tool\nthat softens the effects of language barriers could streamline their day-to-day lives in their receiving society\nand allow them to better pursue personal goals. By publicly releasing our work, we hope that researchers and\ndevelopers can expand the impact of our contributions by building technologies aimed at bridging multilingual\nconnections in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world.\n9.2 Ethical Considerations & Future Work\nAlthough we built the family of Seamless models to be used widely, we recognize that user populations are\nheterogeneous and that our systems may work better for some over others (Wang et al., 2023b). Despite\ncarefully evaluating our artifacts across multiple fairness axes and implementing checks and balances whenever\npossible, model performance may vary depending on users\u2019 race, accent, or gender. Moreover, because of the\ndependencies involved, performance gaps at the ASR stage [which have been well documented (Koenecke et al.,\n2020; Ngueajio and Washington, 2022)], may lead to subsequent performance degradation at the expressive\nand streaming levels. As such, some users may have to continue altering their regular speech patterns to take\nfull advantage of the capabilities offered by our models.\n84\nMoreover, as with all technologies, our models are not impervious to unintended use. In the context of\nSeamless, bad actors could use our models to enact voice phishing (i.e., pretending to be someone on the\nphone to exploit unsuspecting individuals for money or personal information) or deepfakes. By instigating a\nwatermarking mechanism and releasing its detector, we offer one solution to help users identify the synthetic\norigin of the content they are potentially exposed to. That said, taming the effects of the malicious use of AI\nsystems requires a multifaceted approach. Alongside individual-level AI literacy and scam prevention tactics,\nwe believe that increasing public awareness and industry-wide standards around such issues are imperative for\nthe safe implementation of comparable systems in the future.\nTo further the goal of realizing the Universal Speech Translator, future research should continue focusing\non improving language coverage and closing the performance gaps between high-resource and low-resource\nlanguages. More resources should also be directed at ensuring that emerging systems work well for diverse\nuser groups, especially those that have been historically underprioritized when it comes to AI development.\nBeyond spoken and written languages, the visual modality in cross-lingual communication, which comprises\nsign languages and other visual signals (i.e., gestures, facial expressions, lip movements, etc.), deserves further\nattention. For one, access to all modalities is not always possible\u2014availability may be limited either due to\nphysical (i.e., loss of hearing due to old age) or circumstantial reasons (i.e., reduced capacity for speech at a\nloud bar). As such, developing integrative and multimodal translation technologies may propel research on\nadaptive systems that enhance certain modalities when others are compromised. The ability to complement\nhuman communication in such a manner not only makes translation tools more robust, it paves the way for a\nmore inclusive and accessible technological future for many more people.\n85\nContribution Statements\nWe outline the contributions from different team members and organize them into sections, sorting them\nalphabetically by last name. It is impossible to fully capture the dedication and input of every individual who\ncontributed to bringing this project to fruition.\nData\nAcquisition\nCynthia Gao: annotations, data commissioning lead\nElahe Kalbassi: vendor coordination\nAmanda Kallet: data licensing coordinator\nJustine Kao: data licensing and commissioning lead\nCarleigh Wood: annotations, data commissioning\nExpressive\nLoic Barrault: multimodal data aligmnent, SONAR\nexpressive decoding\nPaul-Ambroise Duquenne: SONAR expressive re-\nsearch\nKevin Heffernan: SONAR expressive research, tech-\nnical lead\nArtyom Kozhevnikov: multimodal data alignment\nSemantic\nLoic Barrault: LID training, semantic data align-\nment\nHady Elsahar: semantic data alignment\nHolger Schwenk: speech encoder training, technical\nlead\nTuan Tran: semantic data alignment\nEvaluation\nSemantic\nPierre Andrews: technical lead\nMarta R.

It currently supports text encoders for 200\nlanguages and speech encoders for 37 languages. Sonar is intended for research and development in parallel data alignment,\nespecially for low-resource languages.\n\u2022 Primary intended users: Primary users are researchers and developers in the machine translation community.\n\u2022 Out-of-scope use cases: Sonar is trained on general domain text data and is not intended to be used with domain-specific texts,\nsuch as medical domain or legal domain. The model is not intended to be used for document translation.\nMetrics\n\u2022 Model performance measures: Sonar model was evaluated using BLEU.\nEvaluation Data\n\u2022 Datasets: Fleurs dataset is described in Conneau et al.

It allows for:\n\u2013 ASR: Automatic speech recognition for 96 languages.\n\u2013 S2ST: Speech-to-Speech translation from 100 source speech languages into 35 target speech languages.\n\u2013 S2TT: Speech-to-text translation from 100 source speech languages into 95 target text languages.\n\u2013 T2ST: Text-to-Speech translation from 95 source text languages into 35 target speech languages.\n\u2013 T2TT: Text-to-text translation (MT) from 95 source text languages into 95 target text languages.\n\u2013 TTS: Text-to-speech synthesis for 36 languages.\nInformation on how to use the model can be found in the github repository at https: // github. com/ facebookresearch/\nseamless_ communication along with scripts for evaluation and finetuning.\n\u2022 Primary intended users: Primary users are researchers and machine translation (speech and text) research community.\n\u2022 Out-of-scope use cases:\nSeamlessM4T-Large v2 is a research model and is not released for production deployment.\nSeamlessM4T-Large v2 is trained on general domain data and is not intended to be used with domain-specific inputs,\nsuch as the medical domain or legal domain. The model is not intended to be used for long-form translation. The model was\ntrained on short text and speech inputs, therefore translating longer sequences might result in quality degradation. SeamlessM4T-\nLarge v2 translations can not be used as certified translations.\nMetrics\n\u2022 Model performance measures: For the S2TT task, SeamlessM4T v2 models were evaluated using the BLEU metric adopted by\nSOTA models in speech-to-text translation. The models were additionally evaluated with spBLEU and Blaser 2.0 on S2TT.\nFor S2ST, the models are evaluated with ASR-BLEU and Blaser 2.0. For the T2TT taks, we report quality in terms of chrF.\nFor ASR, we report the widely adopted metric of WER with the text normalized following the normalization in Radford et al.\n(2022). Additionally, we performed human evaluations with the XSTS protocol, measured added toxicity, robustness, and bias,\nand reported red teaming results of SeamlessM4T-Large v2.\nEvaluation Data\n\u2022 Datasets: Fleurs, Flores, CoVoST2 and CVSS, HolisticBias and Multilingual HolisticBias described in Costa-juss`a\net al. (2023).\n\u2022 Motivation: We used Fleurs as it provides an n-way parallel speech and text dataset in 102 languages, on which we can evaluate\nSeamlessM4T v2 models on multiple tasks.\nTraining Data\n\u2022 We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. For data statistics see Tables 63 and 64 of\nSeamless Communication et al, Seamless: Multilingual Expressive and Streaming Speech Translation, Arxiv, 2023\nEthical Considerations\n\u2022 In this work, we took a comprehensive approach to prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them.\nWhile we have documented various evaluation and responsible AI techniques deployed in our work, here are some additional points\nto highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages. While quality translation could improve\nworld readiness and information access for many in these communities, such access could also make groups with lower levels of\ndigital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate\nour work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Finally, although we did our best to\noptimize for translation quality, toxic, biased, or false outputs produced by the model could remain. These could have an adverse\nimpact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).\nCaveats and Recommendations\n\u2022 Limitations: Researchers should consider implementing additional integrity mitigations for \u201cadded toxicity\u201d when using the model\nin a research application.\naFor this card, we use the template from Mitchell et al.

Model Card - AutoPCP\nModel Details a\n\u2022 Person or organization developing model: Developed by FAIR at Meta\n\u2022 Model date: November 30, 2023\n\u2022 Model version: AutoPCP-multilingual-v2 (the v1 version was used internally for expressive automatic alignment)\n\u2022 Model type: A dense 3-layer neural network:\n\u2013 Inputs: two speech embeddings extracted from the 9th layer of the XLSR speech encoder and averaged over frames\n\u2013 Output: unconstrained regression trained to predict mPCP score of \u201cOverall expresive intent\u201d\n\u2022 The exact training algorithm and data described in subsection 7.1\n\u2022 License: CC-BY-NC 4.0 b\n\u2022 Where to send questions or comments about the model: https://github.com/facebookresearch/stopes/issues\nIntended Use\n\u2022 Primary intended uses: Automated comparison of prosodic properties of two spoken utterances with the same semantic content,\nbut potentially in different languages, including:\n\u2013 Automated evaluation of expressivity-preserving translation models\n\u2013 Automated filtering of parallel speech corpora to improve their expressivity preservation properties\nInformation on how to use the model can be found in the Stopes repository:\nhttps: // github. com/ facebookresearch/ stopes/ tree/ main/ stopes/ eval/ auto_ pcp .\n\u2022 Primary intended users: Primary users are researchers and speech translation research community.\n\u2022 Out-of-scope use cases: Comparison of utterances with different semantic content, comparison of audios with primarily non-speech\ncontent, comparing expressivity preservation properties of very different parallel audio corpora.\nMetrics\n\u2022 Model performance measures:\n\u2013 Root mean squared error (RMSE) with respect to the targets (mPCP labels)\n\u2013 Item-level Spearman correlation with the targets\n\u2013 System-level Spearman correlation, i.e. correlation of system-level average model predictions with average targets.\nTraining Data\n\u2022 Audio pairs (English paired with Spanish, French, German, Italian and Mandarin), collected from various sources and annotated\nby humans with mPCP protocol (more details in subsection 7.1)\n\u2022 Unlabelled audio pairs from multilingual videos, used for contrastive learning\nEvaluation Data\n\u2022 A labelled dataset, similar to the annotated part of the training data in its sources and distribution\nEthical Considerations\n\u2022 We did not specifically study possible biases of the model.\nCaveats and Recommendations\n\u2022 The model has been trained to predict PCP scores in the range between 1 and 4; however, its predicted values may occasionally\nfall outside of this range. For a pair of nearly-identical audios, they are often above 5.\n\u2022 The model is intended to evaluate to prosody only; however, it may be sensitive to other properties of input audios. In particular,\nits scores may be negatively affected by background noise and positively affected by similarity of vocal styles.\n\u2022 AutoPCP uses speech embeddings of XLSR (Conneau et al., 2020) as inputs and may inherit all biases and limitations of this\nmodel.\n\u2022 The model may generalize to some degree to all 53 XLSR languages. However, its performance has been evaluated only for the 6\nlanguages mentioned above.\naFor this card, we use the template from Mitchell et al.

Comparison between SeamlessM4T v1 and v2\nIn this section, we evaluate the latency of both SeamlessM4T-Large with the UnitY architecture\n(autoregressive T2U), and that of SeamlessM4T-Large v2 with UnitY2 and its non-autoregressive T2U.\nEach model translated 1000 audios from Fleurs S2ST test set (randomly sampled from hin-eng, spa-eng,\npor-eng, rus-eng, and eng-eng ) while tracking input and intermediate output lengths (input audio in\nseconds and S2TT hypothesis in subword tokens) and the S2ST inference time (in seconds). Our experimental\nsetup used a container with a single A100 (CUDA kernels compiled) and 96 CPUs. We evaluated both models\nafter warm-up with a batch-size of 1, beam search with a width of 5 for both S2TT and auto-regressive T2U\n(SeamlessM4T), and the default decoding options (max-length, length penalties, etc.)\nThe trend lines reported in Figure 30 show that SeamlessM4T v2 is significantly faster than SeamlessM4T\nv1 in S2ST inference. In fact, T2U decoding time in SeamlessM4T scales linearly with the length of text\ngenerated with S2TT. On the other hand, T2U conversion time in SeamlessM4T v2 is independent from\nthe input length. Since T2U decoding takes 70% of the inference time in SeamlessM4T, improving this\nbottleneck in SeamlessM4T v2 with NAR T2U significantly improves the total S2ST inference speed by\nmore than 3x.\n110\nI.2 Data Statistics\nTables 61 and 62 provide statistics per language for data used to train Sonar speech encoders and prepare\nSeamlessAlign per language. For each language we also evaluate our Sonar speech encoder by proxy of\nBLEU score in the task of Fleurs S2TT X\u2013eng using the Sonar text decoder.\nWe provide in Table 63 statistics of ASR and S2TT data (in terms of hours of speech audio) used to train the\nX2T models of SeamlessM4T. Similarly, we provide in Table 64 statistics of S2ST training data.\n111\nraw\naudio\nASR\ndata\nAutomatically aligned\nBLEU\nWL\nSen2Txx\nSxx2Ten\nSxx2Sen\nTotal (Hours)\n2,490,509\n50,773\n129,801\n299,959\n38,488\nAverage (support)\n20.9\n19.1\nAverage (overlap)\n22.0\n19.1\ncode\nRaw\naudio\nHours\nASR\ndata\nHours\nSonar\n\u2191BLEU\nWL\n\u2191BLEU\nAutomatically aligned (Hours)\nSen2Txx\nSxx2Ten\nSxx2Sen\nafr\n3,691\n108\n37.91\n34.10\n1,575\n1,225\n281\namh\n5,676\n51\n11.55\n1.90\n874\n2,768\n284\narb\n119,862\n822\n28.71\n25.50\n2,977\n8,072\n776\nasm\n110\n74\n13.27\n5.40\n244\n25\n9\nazj\n7,690\n52\n13.72\n13.45\n929\n1,158\n171\nbel\n61,204\n1,104\n15.41\n11.70\n1,027\n4,434\n366\nben\n4,360\n335\n19.62\n13.20\n1,067\n1,345\n263\nbos\n2,871\n99\n31.25\n29.70\n1,017\n661\n112\nbul\n3,760\n102\n29.18\n28.50\n3,592\n1,623\n284\ncat\n49,898\n1,738\n35.09\n34.20\n1,995\n4,411\n354\nceb\n33\n\u2014\n3.31\n\u2014\n774\n\u2014\n\u2014\nces\n38,545\n181\n29.77\n27.80\n3,679\n6,905\n602\nckb\n\u2014\n93\n14.56\n\u2014\n527\n\u2014\n\u2014\ncmn\n77,158\n9,320\n17.42\n18.40\n1,873\n18,760\n1,570\ncym\n16,690\n99\n11.66\n13.00\n1,167\n4,411\n278\ndan\n23,469\n115\n31.90\n32.70\n2,499\n6,041\n583\ndeu\n439,595\n3,329\n32.72\n34.60\n7,478\n17,634\n1,921\nell\n9,141\n324\n20.65\n23.70\n\u2014\n2,833\n273\nest\n9,013\n131\n24.69\n18.70\n1,932\n3,346\n607\nfin\n26,132\n184\n21.27\n22.10\n1,355\n6,086\n526\nfra\n233,406\n2,057\n31.22\n32.20\n9,044\n17,380\n3,337\ngle\n282\n57\n4.11\n\u2014\n1,121\n121\n32\nglg\n60,448\n123\n31.29\n27.90\n1,217\n1,385\n295\nguj\n\u2014\n139\n23.63\n16.20\n1,148\n355\n261\nheb\n34,257\n92\n20.71\n21.80\n\u2014\n10,130\n534\nhin\n10,583\n150\n19.55\n22.00\n1,629\n2,977\n530\nhrv\n3,857\n304\n28.65\n27.00\n\u2014\n1,016\n191\nhun\n22,705\n258\n19.86\n21.20\n2,351\n4,044\n526\nhye\n4,175\n145\n21.54\n16.00\n759\n99\n148\nind\n10,109\n269\n25.50\n28.95\n1,860\n2,658\n510\nisl\n1,603\n113\n17.26\n9.10\n1,259\n750\n142\nita\n75,285\n588\n25.30\n23.60\n5,379\n6,508\n817\njav\n1,017\n302\n17.94\n6.59\n508\n6\n52\njpn\n85,861\n17,319\n17.64\n18.16\n522\n21,287\n1,141\nkan\n836\n114\n19.39\n11.60\n936\n936\n198\nkat\n12,028\n188\n12.22\n2.40\n667\n1,270\n168\nkaz\n9,418\n314\n16.81\n5.38\n743\n1,669\n183\nkhk\n255\n143\n9.02\n0.86\n575\n91\n146\nkhm\n9,378\n182\n14.35\n5.63\n492\n\u2014\n\u2014\nkir\n\u2014\n82\n13.78\n\u2014\n684\n99\n58\nkor\n21,380\n316\n16.73\n21.57\n2,228\n8,657\n640\nTable 61 - Statistics on speech encoders and amount of automatically aligned data.

Finally, the last three columns provide the amount of automatically aligned data.\n113\nX\u2013eng\nASR\neng\u2013X\nH\nP\nA\nH\nH\nP\nA\nTotal\n14,434\n52,977\n23,744\n47,296\n8,476\n184,123\n20,377\nX\u2013eng\nASR\neng\u2013X\nH\nP\nA\nH\nH\nP\nA\nafr\n100\n9\n400\n103\n0\n2,218\n400\namh\n38\n20\n399\n58\n0\n2,218\n400\narb\n187\n1,035\n394\n1,236\n507\n1,352\n400\nary\n47\n0\n0\n47\n0\n2,218\narz\n47\n0\n0\n47\n0\n2,218\nasm\n86\n0\n23\n86\n22\n1,987\n203\nazj\n101\n4\n400\n101\n22\n1,987\n400\nbel\n247\n926\n400\n1,172\n22\n1,987\nben\n125\n227\n375\n354\n0\n2,218\n400\nbos\n157\n0\n400\n102\n0\n2,218\n400\nbul\n105\n0\n400\n105\n22\n1,987\ncat\n445\n1,332\n382\n1,833\n506\n1,353\n400\nceb\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2,218\n400\nces\n132\n500\n390\n206\n22\n1,987\nckb\n30\n63\n0\n94\n0\n2,218\n400\ncmn\n425\n12,599\n396\n12,979\n506\n1,353\ncym\n39\n73\n352\n101\n506\n1,353\n400\ndan\n167\n372\n383\n200\n22\n1,987\ndeu\n594\n3,291\n400\n3,843\n496\n1,363\nell\n343\n12\n400\n524\n0\n2,218\neng\n-\n-\n-\n4,066\n-\n-\n-\nest\n131\n12\n373\n144\n500\n1,359\neus\n217\n61\n0\n279\n0\n2,218\n400\nfin\n154\n477\n368\n209\n22\n1,987\n400\nfra\n574\n2,144\n400\n2,429\n22\n2,196\ngaz\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2,218\n66\ngle\n65\n3\n108\n54\n0\n2,218\nglg\n103\n16\n400\n119\n0\n2,218\n400\nguj\n139\n8\n275\n152\n53\n2,218\n400\nheb\n104\n1\n400\n105\n0\n2,218\nhin\n304\n0\n382\n85\n0\n2,218\nhrv\n101\n217\n0\n317\n0\n2,218\nhun\n308\n446\n400\n288\n22\n1,987\nhye\n152\n1\n400\n152\n22\n1,987\n400\nibo\n38\n0\n0\n38\n0\n2,218\n303\nind\n373\n12\n353\n302\n506\n1,353\nisl\n23\n115\n400\n137\n0\n2,218\n400\nita\n138\n941\n383\n630\n22\n1,987\njav\n0\n303\n5\n303\n0\n2,218\n400\njpn\n514\n19,483\n392\n573\n507\n1,352\n400\nkan\n121\n9\n200\n129\n53\n2,218\n400\nkat\n198\n3\n400\n202\n0\n2,218\n400\nkaz\n22\n318\n0\n339\n22\n1,987\n400\nkhk\n163\n2\n74\n166\n506\n1,356\n400\nkhm\n202\n8\n0\n206\n0\n2,218\n400\nX\u2013eng\nASR\neng\u2013X\nH\nP\nA\nH\nH\nP\nA\nkir\n111\n20\n83\n149\n22\n1,987\n400\nkor\n228\n52\n392\n646\n14\n2,218\n400\nlao\n217\n400\n217\n0\n2,218\n361\nlav\n0\n0\n28\nlit\n44\n398\n400\n44\n22\n1,987\nlug\n263\n106\n145\n370\n0\n2,218\n152\nluo\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2,218\n171\nlvs\n103\n0\n400\n103\n506\n1,353\nmai\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2,218\n69\nmal\n59\n55\n313\n114\n0\n2,218\n400\nmar\n100\n25\n312\n110\n22\n1,987\n400\nmkd\n149\n1\n314\n149\n22\n1,987\n400\nmlt\n158\n1\n70\n159\n22\n1,987\n400\nmni\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2,218\nmya\n150\n8\n0\n157\n0\n2,218\nnld\n185\n2,037\n386\n1,804\n22\n1,987\nnor\n115\n126\n0\n228\n0\n2,218\n0\nnpi\n0\n160\n400\n158\n22\n1,988\n400\nnya\n105\n0\n105\n0\n2,218\n400\nory\n93\n0\n53\n93\n22\n1,987\n328\npan\n202\n4\n400\n202\n22\n1,987\n400\npbt\n152\n399\n150\n0\n2,218\n400\npes\n188\n204\n0\n390\n507\n1,352\npol\n88\n725\n386\n377\n22\n1,987\npor\n172\n206\n383\n845\n22\n1,987\nron\n111\n536\n387\n189\n22\n1,987\n400\nrus\n114\n164\n387\n269\n22\n1,988\nslk\n108\n470\n386\n160\n22\n1,987\nslv\n106\n442\n400\n115\n507\n1,352\nsna\n33\n0\n0\n2,218\n400\nsnd\n0\n103\n0\n0\n2,218\n354\nsom\n153\n0\n152\n0\n2,218\n169\nspa\n385\n1,726\n400\n1,886\n22\n2,196\nsrp\n101\n0\n400\n103\n22\n1,987\nswe\n116\n19\n0\n122\n505\n1,358\nswh\n245\n119\n361\n364\n22\n1,987\n400\ntam\n220\n55\n335\n275\n507\n1,352\n400\ntel\n91\n6\n369\n97\n0\n2,218\n400\ntgk\n101\n0\n101\n0\n2,218\ntgl\n191\n0\n373\n103\n0\n2,218\n400\ntha\n133\n72\n387\n269\n0\n2,218\n400\ntur\n241\n39\n362\n380\n506\n1,370\nukr\n105\n39\n387\n319\n22\n2,196\n400\nurd\n489\n23\n371\n213\n21\n1,987\n400\nuzn\n155\n16\n344\n171\n22\n1,987\n400\nvie\n247\n32\n349\n216\n53\n2,218\nyor\n103\n33\n400\n132\n0\n2,218\n201\nyue\n211\n15\n0\n220\n22\n1,987\n400\nzlm\n165\n400\n162\nzul\n67\n0\n67\n0\n2,218\n400\nTable 63 - Statistics of ASR and S2TT data used to train our SeamlessM4T model. We list the data size in hours of speech between\nhuman-labeled (H), pseudo-labeled ASR data (P), and automatically aligned (A). For each language we distinguish between eng\u2013X for\ntranslating from English into that language, and X\u2013eng for translating into English. We qualify as high-resource, languages with more than\n1000 hours of supervision. Languages with between 500 and 1000 hours are dubbed medium-resource, and languages with less than 500\nhours are low-resource.

Note that we do not have speaker information for FLEURs so these rows are left empty.\nEvaluation data.\nWe report the detailed statistics of the evaluation data used in expressive speech-to-speech\ntranslation in Table 72, and it provides a breakdown of data sizes into each language direction.\nUnit Voicebox.\nWe provide empirical details of pre-training and finetuning Unit Voicebox. The model was\nbuilt on 2 convolution layers and 24 Transformer layers with a hidden dimension of 1024 and a feedforward\ndimension of 4096. It has a total of 329M parameters. During pretraining, Unit Voicebox was trained to\npredict the masked spectrogram given speech and the corresponding XLS-R units. The pretraining data is\nlisted in Table 17, and we dealt with data imbalance across languages by upsampling data in each language to\nthe same amount as English speech.\nFor the purpose of data augmentation, we further finetuned Unit Voicebox on multilingual emotion data so\nthat it could generate more expressive speech for Prosody UnitY2 training.\n123\nJ.2 Experimental Setup\nWe provide the full results of mExpresso in Table 73, mDRAL in Table 74, and FLEURS in Table 75.\ncmn-eng\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n19.11\n2.65\n0.52\n23.92\n2.79\n0.29\n2\n22.85\n1.69\n0.13\n25.10\n1.99\n0.13\n3\n22.24\n2.38\n0.59\n24.88\n2.59\n0.26\n4\n23.25\n2.96\n0.78\n27.14\n3.11\n0.54\n5\n23.58\n3.08\n0.82\n26.86\n3.15\n0.56\ndeu-eng\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n34.64\n2.95\n0.36\n29.60\n2.74\n0.39\n2\n38.41\n2.41\n0.10\n33.09\n2.20\n0.07\n3\n38.25\n2.98\n0.29\n32.44\n2.79\n0.35\n4\n43.96\n3.16\n0.70\n37.33\n3.16\n0.70\n5\n43.94\n3.21\n0.71\n36.54\n3.18\n0.71\nfra-eng\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n31.62\n3.05\n0.35\n32.09\n2.83\n0.32\n2\n34.89\n2.36\n0.11\n34.35\n2.10\n0.16\n3\n34.93\n3.13\n0.33\n34.33\n2.70\n0.26\n4\n41.04\n3.35\n0.70\n38.91\n3.06\n0.54\n5\n40.98\n3.46\n0.69\n38.91\n3.10\n0.47\nita-eng\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n29.12\n2.95\n0.40\n32.32\n2.94\n0.37\n2\n33.02\n2.21\n0.12\n35.68\n2.25\n0.01\n3\n32.77\n2.86\n0.33\n35.35\n2.94\n0.25\n4\n39.39\n3.16\n0.69\n41.69\n3.21\n0.74\n5\n38.75\n3.25\n0.70\n41.72\n3.27\n0.75\nspa-eng\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n38.34\n3.08\n0.43\n41.83\n2.84\n0.36\n2\n43.20\n2.45\n0.04\n44.14\n2.24\n0.04\n3\n42.91\n3.21\n0.36\n44.36\n2.80\n0.25\n4\n48.67\n3.47\n0.70\n51.29\n3.17\n0.67\n5\n48.46\n3.52\n0.72\n50.98\n3.19\n0.68\neng-cmn\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n26.36\n2.96\n0.23\n24.02\n2.92\n0.30\n2\n26.85\n2.69\n-0.03\n24.31\n2.56\n-0.02\n3\n27.16\n3.31\n0.14\n23.86\n3.10\n0.19\n4\n26.80\n3.16\n0.55\n25.43\n3.02\n0.52\n5\n26.82\n3.18\n0.54\n25.09\n2.99\n0.52\neng-deu\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n28.94\n2.91\n0.44\n21.01\n2.82\n0.43\n2\n32.45\n2.66\n0.19\n23.13\n2.40\n0.14\n3\n32.11\n3.15\n0.27\n23.00\n2.92\n0.35\n4\n37.07\n3.29\n0.71\n27.43\n3.20\n0.72\n5\n36.82\n3.31\n0.72\n27.46\n3.13\n0.72\neng-fra\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n33.80\n2.98\n0.43\n32.59\n2.87\n0.39\n2\n34.69\n2.72\n0.11\n33.82\n2.48\n0.09\n3\n34.26\n3.16\n0.24\n33.11\n2.89\n0.27\n4\n37.96\n3.28\n0.69\n38.36\n3.20\n0.66\n5\n37.83\n3.28\n0.68\n38.35\n3.12\n0.66\neng-ita\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n31.55\n2.98\n0.37\n28.89\n2.84\n0.37\n2\n33.79\n2.72\n0.16\n31.91\n2.39\n0.14\n3\n33.92\n3.18\n0.30\n31.67\n2.92\n0.35\n4\n39.97\n3.30\n0.74\n37.80\n3.19\n0.69\n5\n39.88\n3.31\n0.73\n37.51\n3.12\n0.68\neng-spa\nDev\nTest\nModel\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\nASR-BLEU\nAutoPCP\nRate\n1\n35.81\n3.03\n0.43\n36.92\n2.91\n0.43\n2\n36.96\n2.61\n0.09\n38.57\n2.35\n0.09\n3\n37.60\n3.10\n0.27\n38.69\n2.84\n0.30\n4\n42.33\n3.37\n0.70\n42.88\n3.25\n0.67\n5\n42.31\n3.38\n0.70\n42.63\n3.18\n0.67\nTable 73 -

Each pair will consist of one {LANG_1} segment and\none {LANG_2} segment.\nOur goal is to know how similar the two segments (utterances) are perceived in terms of:\n1. Semantics/Meaning\n2. Emotion\n3. Rhythm\n4. Overall expressive intent\nDifferent languages have distinct speech patterns related to the aspects mentioned above. When comparing\nexpressivity in different languages, we want to determine if the expressive qualities in {LANG_1} convey\nsimilar information as in {LANG_2}.\nBy \u201coverall expressive intent,\u201d we mean the overall impact and manner in which the speaker spoke the\nsentence. To rate similarity in expressive intent between two audio files, consider aspects like emphasis, tone,\nrhythm, and the speaker\u2019s emotional state combined.\nAll of the dimensions are explained in more detail below.\nM.2.2 Semantics\nThe semantics of an utterance refers to the literal meaning of the words disregarding the manner in which\nthey are spoken.\nExample: The sentence \u201cThere is a green apple\u201d in English has a different meaning from \u201cHay una\nmanzana roja\u201d (\u201cThere is a red apple\u201d) in Spanish.\nQuestion: Do the two segments have a similar meaning?\n1. The two segments are completely different in their meaning\u2014 they refer to different objects, actions, or\nconcepts and the relationships between them.\n2. The two segments are mostly different in their meaning, but share some similarities\u2014there are some\nimportant differences in the meaning of the two segments, although one or more objects, actions or\nconcepts may appear in both sentences.\n3. The two segments are mostly similar in their meaning, but have some differences - they could be\nparaphrases of one another.\n4. The two segments are completely similar in their meaning\u2014they are exact translations of one another.\nM.2.3 Emotion\nEmotion describes the overall feeling of the speaker while they are talking.\n137\nExample: A speaker may sound angry, pleased, happy, or confused (to name just a few emotions) while\nspeaking. Consider whether you could imagine the two speakers making similar facial expressions\nwhile speaking or whether you could apply the same description of their emotions.\nQuestion: Do the two segments sound similar in the speaker\u2019s emotional state?\n1. The two segments sound completely different in the emotions conveyed - basically none of the emotion\naspects are shared. For example, while one utterance might sound very happy throughout, the other\nutterance might sound neutral throughout.\n2. The two segments are mostly different, but share some similarities in terms of emotion. For example,\nwhile one utterance might sound happy throughout, the other utterance might sound neutral throughout\nand happy just at the end.\n3. The two segments are mostly similar in emotion, but have some differences. For example, both utterances\nmight share the same emotion or mix of emotions, but the emotions are more pronounced in one compared\nto the other (one segment sounds very happy while the other is subtly pleased).\n4. The two segments sound completely similar in the emotions conveyed\u2014 basically all of the emotion\naspects are shared. For example, both utterances sound very happy to the same extent and this is\nexpressed similarly throughout.\nM.2.4 Rhythm\nThe rhythm of an utterance describes its speed, pacing (i.e. changes in speed), and pauses. A speaker pausing\nor elongating/shortening words can impact rhythm.\nExample: \u201cYou \u2013 lied to me?\u201d having a pause after \u201cyou\u201d is distinct from \u201cYou lied to \u2013 me?\u201d having a\npause after \u201cto.\u201d A speaker speaking quickly or slowly throughout the sentence, or speeding up/slowing\ndown at certain parts of the sentence, also impacts rhythm.\nQuestion: Do the two segments sound similar in terms of rhythm?\n1. The two segments sound completely different in their rhythm - basically none of the rhythmic aspects\nare shared. For example, one utterance may be spoken slowly at first, have a pause in the middle, then\nfaster at the end, while the other utterance is spoken in a normal cadence throughout.\n2. The two segments are mostly different, but share some similarities in their rhythm. For example, one\nutterance may be spoken slowly at first, have a pause in the middle, then faster at the end, while the\nother utterance may be spoken normally at first and faster at the end without the pause in the middle.\n3. The two segments are mostly similar in their rhythm, but have some differences. For example, one\nutterance may be spoken slowly at first, have a pause in the middle, and then faster at the end, while the\nother utterance is spoken virtually the same, except without the pause in the middle.\n4. The two segments sound completely similar in their rhythm - basically all of the rhythmic aspects are\nshared. For example, one utterance may be spoken slowly at first, have a pause in the middle, and then\nfaster at the end, and the other utterance has the same pattern.\nM.2.5 Overall Expressive Intent\nThe overall expressive intent of an utterance is the combined feeling of the rhythm, emotion, and any\nadditional factors (such as emphasis and intonation) that give rise to the utterance\u2019s overall impact and\nimplications. When comparing the expressive intent across different languages the idea is to assess whether\nthe expressive qualities of the {LANG_1} utterance convey equivalent (or as similar as possible) information\nas the expressive qualities of the {LANG_2} utterance.\n138\nSelect examples of how expressive characteristics can impact intent:\n\u2022 Sarcasm often includes exaggerated emphasis on specific words to express the opposite of what\nis said. Each language has its own way of showing sarcasm through tone and cues, which can\ndiffer a lot even though the underlying sarcastic intent remains the same.\n\u2022 The English question \"Does Amy speak French or German?\"\n\u2013 is understood as a yes-or-no question when delivered with a single rising intonation contour\n\u2013 It is seen as an alternative question when intoned with a rising contour on \"French\" and a\nfalling contour on \"German.\"\n\u2013 Summary: Different languages have their unique intonation patterns and cues for yes-or-no\nor alternative questions, and these can vary widely even though the underlying intent remains\nthe same.\n\u2022 When emphasis is placed on different words in English, the implicit meaning/implications of the\nsentence change:\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t take the train on Monday. (Somebody else did.)\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t take the train on Monday. (I did not take it.)\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t take the train on Monday. (I did something else with it.)\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t take the train on Monday. (I took one of several, or I didn\u2019t take the specific train\nthat would have been implied.)\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t take the train on Monday. (I took something else.)\n\u2013 I didn\u2019t take the train on Monday. (I took it some other day.)\n\u2013 Summary: Different languages have their unique patterns to convey equivalent implications\nto the ones above.\nQuestion: Considering the overall expressive intent of the two utterances, how similar are they?\n1. The two segments are completely different in their overall expressive intent\u2014the information conveyed\nthrough the expressive features and the speaker\u2019s emotional state are different.\n2. The two segments are mostly different across expressive aspects, but share some similarities.\n3. The two segments are mostly similar across expressive aspects, but have some differences.\n4. The two segments are completely similar in their overall expressive intent.\nTip on handling languages with different prosodic characteristics:\nIf a hypothetical \u201cLanguage A\u201d expresses confusion by slowing down (elongating the words and adding\nlarger pauses) and:\n\u2022 Scenario 1: \u201cLanguage B\u201d also expresses confusion by slowing down, then you could compare\nhow similar the emotion being displayed in both languages is in terms of slowing down.\n\u2022 Scenario 2: \u201cLanguage B\u201d expresses confusion by changing the rhythm in some other way such\nas speeding up (rather than slowing down).\n\u2022 Scenario 3: \u201cLanguage B\u201d doesn\u2019t express confusion by altering their rhythm in any other manner,\nbut rather by using a different feature altogether.\nIn Scenario 2 and 3 you would rate the similarity in terms of how you perceive the speaker\u2019s intended\nuse of the expressive/prosodic feature.\nM.2.6 Task Description\n1. Listen to the {LANG_1} segment from start to finish. Then listen to the {LANG_2} segment from\nstart to finish.\n2. Provide your similarity scores on all dimensions as explained above.\n3. Consider the following:\n\u2022 If either of the segments is very garbled or unclear, please check the box \u201caudio issues\u201d and skip\nthe item.\n139\n\u2022 If the segments have the same or similar content, but one has additional content relative to the\nother, please only consider the content shared between the two segments. If the difference in the\namount of content is greater than a few words, please move to the question on Semantics and\nselect a score of 1 (\u201cCompletely Different\u201d). Where this occurs, you will not be answering questions\nrelated to the other expressivity dimensions.\n\u2022 If one or both of the segments have leading or trailing silence, please ignore this and try to focus\non spoken content only.\n\u2022 Two segments can be similar in the presence or absence of the aspects of interest. That is, if\ntwo sentences are both equally neutral in any of the categories, we can also consider them to be\n\u201csimilar.\u201d For example, we would consider two segments as being similar in emotion if they were\nboth spoken in a \u201cneutral\u201d tone.\n\u2022 Please try to rate the similarity independently of the speakers\u2019 voices. For example, in some cases,\nthe source audio may be in a conventionally female voice while the target audio may be in a\nconventionally male voice. Try your best to focus on how the sentence is uttered in terms of the\nexpressive intent, as outlined above, irrespective of the voice differences.\nM.3 Speaker MOS (SMOS)\nM.3.1 Task Instructions\nYour task is to assess the similarity between the voices in two provided speech samples (utterances).\nThe utterances may be in different languages, have completely distinct content, or be spoken in very different\nexpressive styles. Your focus should solely be on the vocal characteristics of the voices such as their overall\nresonance (the voice quality), pitch (higher, lower), power (amplitude or volume), and the overall impression\nof the speakers these characteristics give you. As an example, some voices may sound more shrill or creaky,\nhoarse or nasal, breathy or dull. The characteristics described may give you an overall picture of the speaker -\ntheir perceived age and gender, for example. If nearly all or all of the voice characteristics are shared and\nthe overall impression of the speakers seems like the same person, then you should give a rating of 5. If\nnone of the voice characteristics are shared and the overall picture is of two very different speakers, then you\nshould give a rating of 1. Scores in the middle should reflect the amount of shared characteristics between\nthe two voices. Please disregard the specific words or meaning of the utterances, the emotions expressed, or\nexpressive characteristics such as emphasis, intonation, or rhythm\u2014none of these should influence how you\nassess whether the voices are similar.\nTips on thinking about scoring\n\u2022 Example 1: If Voice 1 has the characteristics \u201cyounger-sounding, breathy, high-pitched\u201d and Voice\n2 has the characteristics \u201colder-sounding, nasal, low-pitched\u201d, none of the voice characteristics\nare shared and this pair may warrant a score of 1.\n\u2022 Example 2: By contrast, if Voice 1 has the characteristics \u201cyounger-sounding, breathy, high-\npitched\u201d and Voice 2 has the characteristics \u201cyounger-sounding, nasal, low-pitched,\u201d at least one\nattribute (younger-sounding) is shared and this pair may warrant a higher rating possibly a 2 or\n3.\nBoth Examples 1 and 2 are simplifications, but the more characteristics that are shared, the higher\nthe score should be, culminating in scores of 5 for which basically all the characteristics indicate the\nspeaker is the same.\nM.3.2 Listening Guidelines\n1. Utilize a headset for a more precise listening experience.\n2. Adjust the volume to a comfortable level during the training. Please avoid changing the volume once\nthe actual evaluation begins.\n140\n3. If either of the segments is very garbled or unclear, please check the box \u201caudio issues\u201d and skip the item.\nM.3.3 Ratings\nPlease rate the voice similarity on a scale from 1 (Not at all similar) to 5 (Extremely similar):\n1. Not at all similar: The voices sound completely different, none of their characteristics are similar.\n2. Slightly similar: The voices have minimal similarities but are mostly characterized by noticeable\ndifferences.\n3. Moderately similar: The voices have some shared characteristics and also some noticeable differences, in\nequal parts.\n4. Very similar: The voices have many shared characteristics, but some minor differences.\n5. Extremely similar: The voices sound nearly identical, as if spoken by the same individual.\n141\nN. Expressive Data Collection\nN.1 mExpresso\nWe present specific training information presented to vendors in charge of facilitating data collection from\nspeakers for mExpresso.\nN.1.1 Resourcing\nScope\nThe goal of this project is to record phrases that are read in different emotions and styles with the\ngiven text prompt. In this task, you vendors are given the scripts and each sentence is paired with one style or\nemotion (e.g. happy, sad, whisper, fast, etc), and their goal is to read the script out loud with the given style.\nFor each style, there will be guidelines to describe how to perform them, and the English examples will also\nbe provided. Your job as a reviewer is to ensure that the recording is clear, it doesn\u2019t have any background\nnoise and that the style or emotion has been properly transmitted through the recording of the script.\nStyle and Performance\nThere are 9 different style requirements for this project (Default, Enunciated, Fast,\nWhisper, Happy, Sad, Angry, Laughing and Confused), you can go over the details on the performance\nrequired for each by visiting this link [We have redacted the link, however the information contained is a\nsingle slide providing the following guidelines\nGeneral Recording Guideline This slide was used for providing guidance to vendors about recording for\nmExpresso data collection.\n\u2022 Avoid Background Noise: There should be minimal to no background noise in the recording.\nThis includes both ambient noise and mechanical noise such as mouse clicks, fan noise from\ncomputers, buzzing from faulty wires. Avoid echo in the background.\n\u2022 Recording/Microphone Quality: Low-quality microphones may not accurately capture the full\nrange of frequencies in a human voice, leading to recordings that can sound muffled or blurred.\n\u2022 Consistent: The recording should be consistent across recordings in the whole dataset from the\nsame speaker, including volume, recording quality. Speech Clarity: The voice should be clear\nand easily understandable. The speaker should avoid mumbling or rushing through sentences.\nas well as several example audios]\nTake into consideration that it is allowed for the vendor to overact the required style, to ensure that anyone is\nable to recognize the style that they are portraying.\nQuality Assurance\nVendors were instructed to monitor the quality of mExpresso recordings and re-record\nwhen quality expectations were not met. The following instructions regarding quality were communicated to\nthe vendor:\nValid recordings meet the following criteria:\n1. The style and the emphasis of the original source recording are correctly reflected in the recorded target\n2. Be intelligible.\n3. Contain exactly the sentence that was provided in Mike.\nNote: If a sentence contains a typo and its correct spelling is clear, the creator has been asked to\nrecord the sentence correctly (e.g. \u201cWhen I was at the zoo, I saw a elephant!\u201d should be recorded as\n\u201cWhen I was at the zoo, I saw an elephant\u201d. If the sentence doesn\u2019t sound coherent in your language, is\nunintelligible to record, or is in another language, please use the button \u201cSkip;; to report it (e.g. \u201cDid\nyou know truck on my way?\u201d).\n4. Be clear without any distortion or background noise.\nInvalid recordings meet the following criteria:\n142\n1. The style and emphasis of the original source recording IS NOT reflected in the recorded target\n2. Empty or incomplete.\n3. Volume is too low (barely understandable at maximum level) or too high (the speaker is shouting).\n4. Contain one or several pauses or hesitations.\n5. Have background noise (people talking, traffic, street or home noise).\n6. Recording does not match written sentences.\n7. Not spoken by a native speaker.\n8. Have mispronounced words of the assigned language.\n9. Recording voice has a speech impediment (a lisp or a stutter) or other condition that could affect their\nvoice (e.g. sore throat).\n10. Recording voice sounds like it\u2019s automatically generated.\n11. Too much silence before, in the middle or at the end of the recording. 1-2 seconds is acceptable at the\nbeginning and at the end. Pauses in between sentences of the same utterances should be avoided.\nN.2 mDRAL\nWe present an overview of various aspects of the data collection protocol used to collect mDRAL data.\nN.2.1 Resourcing\nModerators / Producers\nThe producer, or moderator, is the person responsible for choosing suitable people\nout of the pre-approved pool, planning, leading the conversations, choosing utterances for re-enactment,\nhelping the participants to reach the desirable outcome.\nKeeping all these responsibilities in mind, we were looking for people who understood easily what the purpose\nof the project was, could handle the technical part and were able to troubleshoot, since this project required a\nfair amount of problem solving.\nThe initial training consisted of self-study, follow-up Q&A session with the project manager, tools being set\nup in a specific way required by the project, pilot conversation done by moderator to see if they are able to\nexecute many more after that and post-processing, following specific set of rules. Since initial time input and\neffort wasn\u2019t minor, we were looking for long-term cooperation, not to waste any effort on both sides.\nParticipants\nWe instructed the moderators to set up a quick qualification call with each resource in the\nparticipation pool, prior to planning a conversation with the resource. During this call, moderators explained\nthe process in the nutshell, using the time to have a short conversation with the applicant in both their native\nlanguage and in English to see, if their self-assessment was correct, they understood what was required from\nthem and for them to try the re-enactment itself. Moderators prepared three short sentences in English, asking\nthe applicant to read them with random prosodic markers or emotions present, followed by their re-enactment\ninto the native language.\nApplicant was able to decline participation in case they were not feeling up to the task, while the moderator\nwas able to reject the applicant based on re-enactment or language skills. A certain percentage of applicants\nwere indeed rejected during this process. After an applicant was approved, they received a randomly generated\ntoken to be identified by in files collected during the project.\nN.2.2 Conversation\nTime Effort\nWe record ten minutes of a free-flowing conversation, followed by one hour of re-enactment. In\nsome cases, we needed to prolong the re-enactment because of technical issues. In other cases the participants\nagreed to proceed with a longer re-enactment part, to re-enact more pairs out of a conversation with a\n143\npotential to collect quality data from. This was only done in case the participants confirmed not feeling\nfatigued.\nSet-up\nA Zoom call was planned for the participants. All three of them joined the call with cameras on,\nto create a more personal environment. Moderator explained the purpose of the project and the process\nand presented the prompts for the participants to choose from. Participants agreed on one topic to proceed\nwith, the moderator muted him/herself and turned off the camera. After ten minutes, the moderator turned\nhis/her camera on, informing the participants that their time is up, asking them to rejoin the same call after\n10 minutes.\nBased on the fact we were primarily looking for participants native in the target language and strong in the\nEnglish language, we saw a noticeable struggle in cases where the conversation was recorded in the target\n(native) language, followed by the non-native English re-enactment. Participants struggled not only with the\nlanguage part, but also with the ability to use all prosodic markers so natural for them in the native language.\nBearing this in mind, we opted for English conversation with target language re-enactment in the live project.\nPrompts and Topics\nIn the pre-launch process, our team worked on a list of topics created based on a\npre-configured liset, adding a few more that proved efficient during the pilot. Before the call, the moderator\nchose five topics for the participants to choose from. Right before every conversation started, both participants\nagreed on one to go with. We noticed that the participants were often choosing safe topics to talk about,\nresulting in few of them being re-used often, but despite this fact, the free-flowing conversation naturally led\nthem to other topics, ending up talking about a free range of unplanned topics.\nN.2.3 Re-enactment\nHand-written notes were used by the moderator to establish utterances well suited for the re-enactment. The\nutterances were chosen by the same principal and re-enacted in the same way. Every utterance was replayed\nas many times as required and re-enacted until the desired result was reached.\nIn a situation, where one of the participants did not show up to the planned conversation, the moderator\nwas acting as a conversation partner for the first participant, given the option to re-enact his/her part of\nthe conversation later. Despite this not being required from the moderators, they usually proceed with\nre-enactment of their part, not to lose usable data. Skipping two self-re-enactments would essentially result in\na need for an additional conversation to be planned. This way, moderators are seen as recycled resources in\nthe data collected.\nIn a situation where one of the participants failed to re-join the call for the re-enactment part, moderator\naimed to re-schedule either the whole re-enactment, or a partial one with a missing resource. Worst case\nscenario, only the re-enactment from one participant was used in the final output.\nN.2.4 Quality Control\nDuring the pilot run, we discovered faulty fragments in a sense that some of the fragments collected were\nempty, containing a significant background noise, or cases where the OG (original) and RE (re-enacted) audios\nwere mismatched.\nTo prevent this from happening, we adjusted our internal tool to perform a 100% human QA on the whole\ncontent. Using the combination of both audios and transcripts, we were checking the following:\n1. OG audio not being empty\n2. OG audio not containing a significant background noise\n3. OG audio not containing a significant voice overlap\n(a) If present, the fragment was suggested as not to be used\n4. Transcript of OG audio being correct\n(a) If not, providing a correct transcript later implemented in the .txt files prior to delivery.\n144\n5. RE audio not being empty\n6. RE audio not containing a significant background noise\n7. RE audio not containing a significant voice overlap\n(a) If present, the fragment was suggested as not to be used\n8. Transcript of RE audio being correct\n(a) If not, providing a correct transcript later implemented in the .txt files prior to delivery.\nDue to the Zoom setting enabling the creation of two separate audio files for each participant, while the\nre-enactment was done, the audio from the second participant was not being replayed. This way, spotting a\nstrong voice overlap was not spotted until the QA was done on fragments pulled out by the script.\nNon-significant back-channel, laughter or a short response was not presenting an issue, strong overlap was\nflagged.\n145\n",

It is designed to\nfacilitate the research and development of neural speech processing technologies\nby being simple, \ufb02exible, user-friendly, and well-documented. This paper describes\nthe core architecture designed to support several tasks of common interest, allowing\nusers to naturally conceive, compare and share novel speech processing pipelines.\nSpeechBrain achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in a wide range\nof speech benchmarks. It also provides training recipes, pretrained models, and\ninference scripts for popular speech datasets, as well as tutorials which allow anyone\nwith basic Python pro\ufb01ciency to familiarize themselves with speech technologies.\n1\nIntroduction\nOpen-source toolkits have played a critical role in the development of speech processing technology\n[1\u20135]. Kaldi [5], for instance, is an established speech recognition framework, which is implemented\nin C++ with recipes built on top of Bash, Perl, and Python scripts. Despite being ef\ufb01cient, its use\nof C++ can make prototyping of new deep learning methods dif\ufb01cult. With the advent of general-\npurpose deep learning libraries like TensorFlow [6] and PyTorch [7], more \ufb02exible speech recognition\nframeworks have quickly appeared, e.g., DeepSpeech [8], RETURNN [9], PyTorch-Kaldi [10],\nEspresso [11], Lingvo [12], Fairseq [13], ESPnet [14], and NeMo [15].\n\u2217Work conducted while at National Taiwan University.\n\u2020Work conducted while on an internship at Mila - Quebec AI Institute.\nPreprint.

Examples are Asteroid [16] for speech\nseparation, pyannote [17] and sidekit [18] for speaker diarization, and s3prl [19] for self-supervised\nspeech representations. While excelling at speci\ufb01c tasks, these frameworks have different coding\nstyles, standards, and programming languages, making it challenging and time-consuming to migrate\nfrom one codebase to another. Moreover, their combination in complex speech processing pipelines\nposes a challenge for interoperability, as connecting different frameworks might be unnatural and\ntheir codebases can interact in unpredictable ways.\nOur experience suggests that having a single, \ufb02exible, multi-task toolkit can signi\ufb01cantly speed up the\ndevelopment of speech technologies. Due to growing interest in end-to-end spoken dialog systems\n(e.g., virtual assistants), implementing composite pipelines within an integrated toolkit offers many\nadvantages. A single toolkit, for instance, encourages the exploration of transfer learning and joint\ntraining techniques across different tasks [20\u201323] and enables the creation of fully differentiable\ngraphs where multiple technologies are trained jointly and learn to interact.\nInspired by this vision, we have developed SpeechBrain3, an all-in-one PyTorch-based toolkit\ndesigned to facilitate the development, portability, and ease of use of speech processing technologies.\nThe name SpeechBrain highlights the need for a holistic system capable of performing multiple\ntasks at once, for example, recognize speech, understanding its content, language, emotions, and\nspeakers. Our toolkit is not only intended for speech researchers, but also for the broader machine\nlearning community, enabling users to easily integrate their models into different speech pipelines\nand compare them with state-of-the-art (SotA) baselines. Our main contributions in this paper are:\n\u2022 The presentation of SpeechBrain, with an emphasis on how we designed it to support multiple\ntasks without sacri\ufb01cing simplicity, modularity, or \ufb02exibility.\n\u2022 The implementation and experimental validation of both recent and long-established speech\nprocessing models with SotA or competitive performance on a variety of tasks (cf. Table 1).\nMore broadly, we believe the SpeechBrain toolkit has the potential to signi\ufb01cantly accelerate research\nand innovation in the \ufb01eld of speech processing and deep learning.\n3The toolkit website can be found at speechbrain.github.io/.\n2\n2\nRelated Work\nA few other toolkits support multiple speech tasks. Of these, the ones we consider most related to\nSpeechBrain are Fairseq [13], NeMo [15], and ESPnet [14]. Fairseq is developed by Facebook to\nsupport sequence-to-sequence processing. It includes models such as ConvS2S [60], transformers\n[61], and wav2vec [62]. However, speech processing encompasses several paradigms outside of\nsequence-to-sequence modeling. SpeechBrain also supports regression tasks (e.g., speech enhance-\nment, separation), classi\ufb01cation tasks (e.g., speaker recognition), clustering (e.g., diarization), and\neven signal processing techniques (e.g., multi-microphone combination).\nNeMo is a toolkit for conversational AI developed by NVIDIA, which provides useful neural modules\nfor many speech processing tasks, including speech recognition, speaker diarization, voice-activity\ndetection and text-to-speech. Due to its industrial orientation, NeMo offers ef\ufb01cient ready-to-use\nmodels, such as Jasper [63], QuartzNet [64], and Citrinet [65]. SpeechBrain also provides several\nready-to-use models, but focuses more heavily on research and education by providing a wide variety\nof baselines, models, and recipes that users can easily inspect and modify in the experiments.\nESPnet, in its current form, is the closest toolkit to SpeechBrain. Both are academically driven and\nsupport numerous speech tasks. ESPnet started as an end-to-end speech recognition library and\nprogressively grew to support different tasks. By contrast, we designed SpeechBrain to address a\nwide variety of tasks from the outset. This means that combining technologies and developing recipes\nfor new tasks is extremely simple.\n3\nDesign Principles\nBeyond the multi-task vision highlighted in the introduction, we developed SpeechBrain with the\nfollowing design principles in mind:\nAccessibility: SpeechBrain is designed to be easily understandable by a large user base, including\nearly students and practitioners. Therefore, we devoted considerable effort to develop intuitive\nmodules that are easy to interconnect with each other. One remarkable peculiarity of SpeechBrain\nis that it serves educational purposes as well. We thus have written extensive documentation and\ntutorials with Google Colab to help newcomers become more familiar with speech technologies.\nPrior work has shown code snippets aid in adopting a codebase [66]. Motivated by this, SpeechBrain\nprovides runnable code snippets in docstrings (documenting interaction at the granular level), tutorial\nnotebooks (explaining single topics), and template \ufb01les (describing full experiments on different\ntasks). To make our toolkit as accessible as possible, we have released it under a very permissive\nlicense (Apache 2.0).\nEase of use: SpeechBrain employs a simple software stack (i.e., Python \u2192PyTorch \u2192SpeechBrain)\nto avoid dealing with too many levels of abstractions. It is developed on top of PyTorch directly,\nwithout an external API. PyTorch-compatible code works in our toolkit without any further modi\ufb01ca-\ntion. SpeechBrain has a minimal list of external dependencies that are all installable via PyPI. The\ninstallation process simply requires running the command pip install speechbrain and is done\nwithin a few minutes. The code is Pythonic and maximizes the use of PyTorch routines.\nReplicability: SpeechBrain promotes open and transparent science. We trained most of our models\nwith publicly available data. This way, our results can be easily replicated by the community. Several\npre-trained models, which only require a few lines of code to use, are distributed via Hugging Face\n[67]. Besides sharing the code and the trained models, we also share the whole experiment folder,\nwhich contains all the needed details (e.g., logs) to reproduce our results.\n4\nArchitecture\nFrom an architectural standpoint, SpeechBrain sits in between a library and a framework. Where\nlibraries require users to manage data\ufb02ow by calling library-de\ufb01ned functionality, frameworks\nprimarily de\ufb01ne a custom lifecycle in which user-de\ufb01ned functionalities are invoked in speci\ufb01c places\n(inversion of control). Most code in SpeechBrain follows a library-style collection of modular and\nstandalone building blocks, including practical routines for data loading, decoding, signal processing,\nand other convenient utilities. However the central Brain class (see \u00a7 4.4), uses inversion of control\n3\nData Manifest\nHyperparams\nTraining Script\nMain\n\u00a0Brain\u00a0 sub-class definition\nCustom data pipeline definition\nLoad hyperparams\nMake PyTorch  Dataset\u00a0 \nInstantiate Brain sub-class\nCall  brain.fit()\u00a0 \nCall  brain.evaluate()\u00a0 \nTrained Model\nFigure 1: An overview of a basic training script.\nBrain.fit()\nself.make_dataloader()\nself.on_fit_start()\nself._compile_jit()\nself.init_optimizers()\nfor epoch in epoch_counter:\nself.on_stage_start(Stage.TRAIN)\nself.fit_batch(batch)\np = self.compute_forward(batch)\nloss = self.compute_objectives(p, batch)\n# perform parameter update\nfor batch in train_set:\nself.on_stage_end(Stage.TRAIN)\nself.on_stage_start(Stage.VALID)\nfor batch in valid_set:\nself.evaluate_batch(batch)\np = self.compute_forward(batch)\nloss = self.compute_objectives(p, batch)\nself.on_stage_end(Stage.VALID)\nFigure 2: Illustration of Brain.fit().\nto de\ufb01ne a general training loop. Therefore, SpeechBrain is most accurately described as a toolkit.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the code for training a model is contained within a single Python script.\nTraining begins by calling the script with a set of hyperparameters: python train.py hparams.yaml .\nThese hyperparameters, declared in human-readable YAML format, contain the location of one\nor more data manifest \ufb01les using either CSV or JSON formats (see Appendix A.4). Unlike many\nother toolkits, SpeechBrain orchestrates experiments in Python directly, without relying on external\nBash scripts. This allows code for data loading, modeling, optimization, and evaluation to interact\nnaturally. Moreover, the training script exposes the computations likely to be changed most frequently\n(e.g., forward computations, data transformations, etc.), making them easy to access and modify.\nSpeechBrain treats the user\u2019s code as a \ufb01rst-class citizen: all PyTorch-compatible code written by the\nuser is treated the same as SpeechBrain code. In the following sub-sections, we explore the anatomy\nof a training script in more detail.\n4.1\nHyperparameters\nThe model hyperparameters, in conjunction with the training script, regulate various properties of\nthe pipeline such as model architecture, training, and decoding. SpeechBrain relies on an extended\nversion of YAML called HyperPyYAML, as shown in the following excerpt:\n1\ndropout: 0.2\n2\nfeatures: !new:speechbrain.lobes.features.MFCC\n3\nn_mels: 40\n4\nleft_frames: 5\n5\nright_frames: 5\n6\n7\nmodel: !new:torch.nn.LSTM\n8\ninput_size: 440\n9\nhidden_size: 256\n10\nnum_layers: 4\n11\ndropout:\n!ref <dropout >\n12\nbidirectional: True\nListing 1: An excerpt of a YAML \ufb01le for hyperparameter speci\ufb01cation.\nHyperPyYAML is not just an ordinary list of hyperparameters, but allows a complex hyperparameter\nspeci\ufb01cation that de\ufb01nes objects along with their corresponding arguments. There is always an\nexplicit reference between the hyperparameter declarations and any object using them, making the\ncode more interpretable and simpler to debug. Overriding the contents of the YAML \ufb01le (e.g., for\nhyperparameter search) can also be done easily by passing command-line arguments:\n1 $ python train.py hparams.yaml --learning_rate =0.1 --dropout =0.5\n4\nSpeechBrain initializes the classes automatically when reading the YAML \ufb01le, thus eliminating\nboilerplate initialization code from the training script. HyperPyYAML is a general tool for specifying\nhyperparameters. To enable modular reusuability, we have released it as a separate repository on\nPyPI4.\n4.2\nData loading\nSpeechBrain complements standard PyTorch data loading by addressing the typical challenges\nthat occur when working with speech, such as handling variable-length sequences, large\ndatasets, and complex data transformation pipelines.\nOur\nDynamicItemDataset inherits from\ntorch.utils.data.Dataset and creates a dataset-interface based on a data-manifest \ufb01le. The data-\nmanifest \ufb01le contains static items, such as \ufb01lepaths or speaker labels. Then, dynamic items provide\ntransformations based on the existing items (static or dynamic), as shown in the following example:\n1 @speechbrain.utils.data_pipeline.takes(\"file_path\")\n2 @speechbrain.utils.data_pipeline.provides(\"signal\")\n3 def audio_pipeline(file_path):\n4\nreturn speechbrain.dataio.read_audio(file_path)\nListing 2: An example of a custom data pipeline.\nThis function takes an audio \ufb01le path (a static item) and reads it as a tensor called \"signal\" (a dynamic\nitem). Any library for reading audio \ufb01le can be used here, including torch.audio5. The evaluation\norder of the items is determined by a dependency graph. Users can de\ufb01ne operations such as reading\nand augmenting an audio \ufb01le, encoding a text label into an integer, basic text processing, etc. The\ndynamic items are de\ufb01ned in the training script and are thus directly customizable by the users.\nMoreover, by leveraging the PyTorch DataLoader class, these data pipelines are automatically\napplied in parallel across different workers.\n4.3\nBatching\nSpeech sequences for a given dataset typically vary in length and require zero-padding to create\nequal-length batches. This tends to add some complication during the training process. First, the\nlength of each sentence within each batch must be tracked so we can later remove zero-padded\nelements from computations like normalization, statistical pooling, losses, etc. Another issue that\narises is how to avoid wasting computational resources processing zero-padded elements.\nOne approach to mitigate this issue is to sort data by sequence length before batching, which\nminimizes zero-padding but sacri\ufb01ces randomness in the batch creation process. A more sophisticated\napproach is to apply dynamic batching [68, 69], where sentences are clustered by length and sampled\nwithin the same cluster, a trade-off between random and sorted batching. This allows the batch size\nto be dynamically changed according to sentence length, leading to improved ef\ufb01ciency and better\nmanagement of available GPU memory. All the aforementioned batching strategies are supported by\nSpeechBrain, allowing users to choose the approach that meets their speci\ufb01c needs.\n4.4\nThe Brain class\nSpeechBrain implements a general training loop in the Brain class. The Brain.fit() method is\ninspired by similar methods in libraries such as Scikit-learn [70], Scipy [71], Keras [72], fastai [73],\nand PyTorch Lightning [74]. Figure 2 illustrates the basic components of the Brain.fit() method.\nThe following is a simple demonstration:\n1 import torch , speechbrain\n2\n3 class SimpleBrain(speechbrain.Brain):\n4\ndef compute_forward(self , batch , stage):\n5\nreturn self.modules.model(batch[\"input\"])\n4github.com/speechbrain/HyperPyYAML\n5https://github.com/pytorch/audio\n5\nTable 2: Phoneme Error Rate (PER%) achieved\nwith SpeechBrain on TIMIT using different\nspeech recognizers.\nTechnique\n# Params\nDev\nTest\nCTC\n10 M\n12.34\n14.15\nTransducer\n10 M\n12.66\n14.12\nCTC+Att\n10 M\n12.74\n13.83\nCTC+Att+SSL\n318 M\n7.11\n8.04\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nPhone Error Rate (PER%)\nBiRNN\nRNN-CRF\nLiGRU\nLiGRU + Reg\nVq-wav2vec*\nwav2vec*\nCTC+Att+SSL* (our recipe)\nFigure 3: Evolution of the SotA performance\nfor TIMIT.

Repetitive boilerplate, such as setting\ntrain() and eval() \ufb02ags, putting the models on the speci\ufb01ed device, and computing gradients are\nhandled by the Brain class. Users can override any step of the process, allowing the de\ufb01nition of\nmore complicated (e.g., GAN [75]) training procedures. The Brain class also handles validation,\nlearning rate scheduling, and fault-tolerant model checkpointing, so that training can resume where it\nleft off if execution is interrupted (e.g., by preemption on a cluster). Further details about the Brain\nAPI are provided in \u00a7 A.4.4.\n4.5\nOther features\nBeyond the functionalities mentioned in the previous sections, additional features include:\nMulti-GPU training: SpeechBrain supports both DataParallel and DistributedDataParallel\nmodules, allowing the use of GPUs on the same and different machines. Automatic mixed-precision\ncan be enabled by setting a single \ufb02ag to reduce the memory footprint of the models. Moreover, the\nlibrary supports PyTorch\u2019s Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for native compilation.\nLarge-scale experiments: SpeechBrain extends WebDataset6 with on-the-\ufb02y dynamic batching and\nbucketing. This enables ef\ufb01cient batching in sequential shard-based data reading, which is necessary\nfor processing large corpora on network \ufb01lesystems.\nOn-the-\ufb02y feature generation: Rather than serializing intermediate features to disk, SpeechBrain\nloads raw waveforms and supports a wide variety of ef\ufb01cient streaming operations for audio pro-\ncessing. Standard features like the Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT) and Mel-\ufb01lterbanks are\ncomputed at training time, allowing differentiation and waveform-level augmentation [76]. Many\nrecipes include on-the-\ufb02y augmentations such as adding noise, time warping, or feature masking.\n6https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset\n6\n5\nResults\nThis section describes use cases of SpeechBrain, highlighting the techniques implemented and the\ncorresponding performance. For more details on datasets, models, and experimental settings, please\nrefer to the appendix (\u00a7 A.5).\n5.1\nSpeech recognition\nThe toolkit supports common techniques for end-to-end speech recognition with different levels\nof complexity. The simplest system employs an encoder trained with Connectionist Temporal\nClassi\ufb01cation (CTC) [77]. An alternative model is the Transducer [25], which augment CTC with an\nautoregressive component and a prediction network. The toolkit supports attention-based encoder-\ndecoder architectures as well [26]. In particular, CTC+Att systems rely on an encoder-decoder\narchitecture with an additional CTC loss applied on the top of the encoder. SpeechBrain is designed\nsuch that users can easily plug in any encoder and decoder modules into the speech recognition\npipeline. For instance, we implemented an effective CRDNN encoder, which combines convolutional,\nrecurrent (e.g., LSTM [78], GRU [79], Light GRU [80]), and fully connected neural networks. As an\nalternative, users can plug in one of the transformers that we have made available. Pre-training based\non self-supervised learning (SSL) with wav2vec 2.0 [62] is supported.\nWe also implemented an ef\ufb01cient GPU-based beam search that combines the acoustic and the\nlanguage information to retrieve the \ufb01nal sequence of words. The training scripts for language models\nand tokenizers (using SentencePiece [81]) are provided as well. In the following, we report the\nperformance achieved with SpeechBrain recipes on some popular speech benchmarks.\n5.1.1\nTIMIT\nTIMIT [31] is a small speech dataset with expert-labeled phone sequences. Table 2 reports the Phone\nError Rate (PER) achieved with the aforementioned techniques. All systems use a CRDNN encoder,\nexcept for the CTC+Att+SSL one which uses a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 encoder [62]. We report the\naverage performance out of \ufb01ve runs with different random seeds. The standard deviation ranges\nbetween 0.15% and 0.2% in all the models.\nCTC and Transducers provide similar results, while the combination of CTC and attention (CTC+Att)\nreaches the best performance. The results achieved by our best model (PER 13.8%) is SotA for\nTIMIT performance with no extra data. A considerable improvement in PER is observed when\nLight-GRUs [80] are used instead of GRUs [79] or LSTMs [78] in the CRDNN encoder. We also\nobserve a performance boost when using self-supervised pre-training with the wav2vec model trained\non unlabelled data from the Libri-Light dataset (CTC+Att+SSL) [82]. Our result with this Libri-Light\nself-supervised pre-training (PER of 8.04%) slightly outperforms the previous SotA performance\nwith the same pre-training data (PER of 8.30%), as shown in Figure 3.\n5.1.2\nLibriSpeech\nLibriSpeech [28] is a popular speech recognition benchmark derived from audiobooks. Table 3\nreports the results achieved with different SpeechBrain recipes on this dataset.\nTable 3: Word Error Rate (WER%) achieved on LibriSpeech with SpeechBrain.\nTechnique\nEncoder\nDecoder\n# Params\ntest-clean\ntest-other\nCTC+Att\nCRDNN\nGRU\n230 M\n2.91\n8.07\nCTC+Att\nTransformer\nGRU\n161 M\n2.46\n5.77\nOur best system is a transformer [61] combined with a convolutional front-end based on ContextNet\n[83]. The autoregressive decoder estimates 5k subword tokens derived from running byte-pair\nencoding on top of the training transcriptions [81]. A transformer-based LM is trained on the\nLibriSpeech text corpus and used within the beam search to rescore partial hypotheses. The best\nWER that we have achieved on the test-clean dataset is 2.46%. This performance is comparable\nwith the results reached in the literature when using transformers without additional data [84]. As\n7\nTable 4: Equal Error Rate (EER %) achieved on\nVoxCeleb1 - Cleaned dataset.\nTechnique\nEER(%)\nVoxCeleb2 baseline [35]\n3.95\nKaldi x-vector [32]\n3.10\nResNET-50 [87]\n1.19\nECAPA (original paper) [33]\n0.87\nSpeechBrain x-vector + PLDA\n3.20\nSpeechBrain ECAPA\n0.81\nSpeechBrain ECAPA (vox1+2)\n0.69\nTable 5: Diarization Error Rate (DER%) on the\neval set of the AMI corpus.\nTechnique\nKnown\n# spks\nEstim.\n# spks\nMCGAN [88]\n4.49\n5.38\nClusterGAN [88]\n3.91\n8.16\nxvector+MCGAN [88]\n4.23\n4.92\nxvector+ClusterGAN [88] 3.60\n2.87\nVBx (ResNet101) [89]\n\u2014\n4.58\nSpeechBrain ECAPA\n2.82\n3.01\none can note, the LibriSpeech task is almost perfectly solved by modern speech recognizers. We thus\nfocus on more realistic tasks as well, as suggested in some recent works [85, 86]. See the appendix\n(\u00a7 A.2) for a more detailed comparison with other toolkits on LibriSpeech and other tasks.\n5.1.3\nCommon Voice\nThe Common Voice corpus [29] is a multilingual open-source collection of transcribed speech based\non crowdsourcing data collection. CommonVoice is challenging due to signi\ufb01cant accented speech,\nhesitations, presence of foreign words, noise, reverberation, and other recording artifacts.\nTable 6 reports the results obtained on four different languages. No language models are trained for\nthis task. The best results are obtained with a wav2vec 2.0 encoder pre-trained with 100k hours of\nmultilingual data from the VoxPopuli dataset [90]. Except for English, the best systems use a GRU\ndecoder on the top of the pre-trained transformer. CommonVoice is a newer dataset, and there have\nbeen relatively few systems evaluated on it. To the best of our knowledge, however, our results are\nSotA for these languages.\nTable 6: Word Error Rate (WER%) achieved with Common Voice Corpus 6.1 using SpeechBrain on\nthe English (En), French (Fr), Italian (It), and Kinyarwanda (Kw) subsets.\nTechnique\nEncoder\nDecoder\n# Params\nEn\nFr\nIt\nKw\nCTC+Att\nCRDNN\nGRU\n148M\n24.89\n17.70\n16.61\n24.27\nCTC+SSL\nTransformer\n-\n320M\n15.58\n14.44\n10.93\n23.12\nCTC+Att+SSL\nTransformer\nGRU\n330M\n15.69\n13.34\n9.86\n18.91\n5.2\nSpeaker recognition and diarization\nSpeechBrain implements the functionalities needed to support speaker recognition and speaker\ndiarization. It supports popular embeddings derived from Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs)\n[91, 92], such as x-vectors [32] and the recent ECAPA-TDNN embeddings [33]. Furthermore,\nSpeechBrain provides traditional Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) for speaker\ndiscrimination [93, 94].\nTable 4 reports the performance achieved on a speaker veri\ufb01cation task with models trained on\nVoxCeleb2 [35] and tested on VoxCeleb1-clean [34]. The best model for speaker embeddings\navailable in SpeechBrain is the ECAPA-TDNN, which matches the performance achieved in the\noriginal paper [33]. This model outperforms both the x-vectors [32] and the ResNet-34 [87] by a\nlarge margin. To the best of our knowledge, the EER reached so far by SpeechBrain on VoxCeleb is\nthe best so far reached by an open-source toolkit.\nTable 5 reports the performance achieved on speaker diarization with the AMI meeting corpus [38]\nwhen using the embeddings available in SpeechBrain. In this case, the embeddings are clustered\nwith spectral clustering to assign a relative speaker label to each segment of the recording [37]. The\nresults shown are obtained on the of\ufb01cial Full-ASR split of the AMI corpus while keeping 0.25\nsec of forgiveness collar. The best diarization system available in SpeechBrain outperforms recent\n8\nTable 7: Speech enhancement performance on\nVoiceBank-DEMAND.\nTechnique\n# Params PESQ\nCOVL\nFacebook\nDEMUCS [95]\n60.8 M\n3.07\n3.63\nSpeechBrain\nMimic Loss\n22.3 M\n3.05\n3.74\nSpeechBrain\nMetricGAN+\n1.9 M\n3.15\n3.62\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\nPESQ\nSEGAN\nMMSE-GAN\nSERGAN\nMetricGAN\nPHASEN\nT-GSA\nDEMUCS\nMetricGAN+ (our recipe)\nFigure 4: Evolution of the speech enhancement\nperformance (PESQ) for Voicebank-DEMAND.\nTable 8: Scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio\nimprovement (SI-SNRi) in dB achieved with\nSpeechBrain on WSJ2mix and WSJ3mix.\nTechnique\n2-mix\n3-mix\nConvTasnet\n15.3\n12.7\nDualPath-RNN\n18.8\n14.7\nSepFormer\n20.4\n17.6\nSepFormer+DM\n22.3\n19.5\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\nSI-SNRi(dB)\nChimera++\nTasNet\nConvTasNet\nHybrid-TasNet\nDeepCasa\nDualPath-RNN\nGated DualPath-RNN\nWavsplit\nSepFormer+DM (our recipe)\nFigure 5: Evolution of the SotA performance (SI-\nSNRi) on the wsj2mix dataset.

We have also obtained competitive results\nwhen the number of speakers is unknown.\n5.3\nSpeech enhancement and separation\nSpeechBrain supports speech enhancement models with different input features (e.g., spectral and\nwaveform domain) and training losses (e.g., L1, MSE, and STOI). In addition, it supports a variety of\nmore sophisticated multi-model training techniques such as Mimic Loss [40] and MetricGAN+ [39].\nIn Table 7 we compare the best enhancement systems available in SpeechBrain against the SotA\nDEMUCS model [95] on the Voicebank-DEMAND corpus [96]. The mimic loss system uses a speech\nrecognition model to provide a perceptual loss, achieving SotA performance on the COVL metric.\nCombining models for different tasks (as done here) is natural to implement in SpeechBrain. We also\nre-implemented the recently proposed MetricGAN+, which performs speech enhancement with an\nadversarially trained metric network [75]. Figure 4 shows the evolution of the PESQ performance on\nthis corpus over the last few years. The SpeechBrain implementation of MetricGAN+ achieves the\nSotA PESQ performance when no extra data are used.\nSpeechBrain implements popular models for speech separation as well, namely ConvTasnet [43] and\nDual-path RNN [44]. Moreover, it supports the recently proposed SepFormer [45], which uses a\npipeline of two transformers within a dual-path framework. Table 8 reports the results achieved on\nthe standard WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix datasets [46], which contain mixtures composed of two or\nthree overlapped speakers, respectively. The last row compares performance achieved with dynamic\nmixing, in which the training data are generated dynamically on-the-\ufb02y instead of using a frozen\ndataset. As shown in Figure 5, SpeechBrain\u2019s SepFormer implementation achieves SotA on both\ndatasets.\n9\n6\nLimitations and Future Work\nThe current version of SpeechBrain supports many other tasks, including spoken language understand-\ning, keyword spotting, multi-microphone signal processing, and language modeling. The toolkit also\nsupports complex [97] and quaternion neural networks [98]. Please refer to A.3 for further details. It\ndoes not currently support text-to-speech, which will be added shortly (pending pull-requests under\nreview). In the future, we plan to support decoding with Finite State Transducers (FSTs) [99] and are\nconsidering to adopt the FST implementation of the ongoing k2 project [100] once stable. We plan to\ndevote further effort to real-time speech processing, which was not the main focus of the \ufb01rst release.\nFinally, our goal is to add support for additional languages and further expand the set of recipes to\nopen-source datasets not yet available in the toolkit (e.g., TED-LIUM [101]).\n7\nConclusion\nThis paper described SpeechBrain, a novel, open-source, all-in-one speech processing toolkit. Our\nwork illustrated the main design principles behind this toolkit and remarked on the design principles\nthat led us to support multiple tasks without sacri\ufb01cing simplicity, modularity, or \ufb02exibility. Finally,\nwe showed several use cases where the technology developed in SpeechBrain reaches SotA or\ncompetitive performance. The main contribution to the scienti\ufb01c community is the development of a\nnovel toolkit that can signi\ufb01cantly accelerate future research in the \ufb01elds of speech processing and\ndeep learning. SpeechBrain is a coordinated effort towards making speech processing technology\naccessible, and are eager to see where its rapidly growing community of users takes the project in the\nfuture.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nWe would like to sincerely thank our generous sponsors: Samsung, Dolby, Nvidia, Nuance, ViaDialog.\nSpecial thanks to our institutional partners: Mila, LIA (Avignon University), CaMLSys (University\nof Cambridge), Sherbrooke University, and Bio-ASP (Academia Sinica).

IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 14(4):1462\u20131469,\n2006.\n16\nA\nAppendix\nA.1\nStatement on social impact\nSpeech technologies can support humans in a variety of positive ways (e.g., helping hearing-impaired\nindividuals, detecting speech pathologies, helping people learning new languages, allowing people\nwith physical disabilities to control their home appliances, etc.). They can make our life safer\n(e.g., in-car speech recognition) or just more comfortable (e.g., with voice assistants, etc.). The\ngrowing demand for speech technology observed in the last few years con\ufb01rms the importance of this\ntechnology in everyday lives. However, non-ethical misuses of these technologies are possible as\nwell. Most of them are related to well-known privacy concerns, which can be mitigated with more\nrigid regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation7 (GDPR) adopted in Europe.\nAs with all other open-source toolkits, we cannot have full control over the actual use of the\ndeveloped technologies. However, we strongly encourage ethical use of our toolkit, and we ask\nall SpeechBrain users to fully respect the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of\nArti\ufb01cial Intelligence8. Moreover, we think that having open-source technology available to everyone\nis better than leaving it in the hands of a few players only. This can potentially mitigate the negative\nconsequences of this ongoing societal change towards an AI-aided society.\nA.2\nPerformance comparison with other toolkits\nComparing the performance across speech processing toolkits is often problematic for several reasons\nand can be deceptive if not framed in a much larger context. First, each toolkit focuses more on\nsome tasks or models and provides recipes only for speci\ufb01c datasets. Secondly, there are intrinsic\ndifferences in how these toolkits implement recipes for the same task on the same dataset. For\nexample, Kaldi relies only on hybrid speech recognition, while others such as SpeechBrain, ESPNet,\nand NeMo do not currently support hybrid speech recognition but instead provide more modern\nE2E speech recognition models. Thirdly, even across recipes concerning the same model on the\nsame dataset, some differences arise due to different feature extraction, data loading pipelines,\nbatching mechanisms, and other implementation details. Finally, most of the aforementioned toolkits\nare active projects, and the performance of a given task might change over time. We think that\nthe comparison proposed in the section can only be used to probe whether a toolkit can provide\nreasonable performance compared to other open-source implementations. Table 9 compares the\nbest results reported in the of\ufb01cial repository of each toolkit on tasks and datasets we have found in\ncommon (as of May 2021).\nWe can see that SpeechBrain achieves competitive performance with other pre-existing toolkits\nacross different tasks and datasets. It is worth mentioning that all the toolkits considered here can\nsupport all the tasks and datasets reported in Table 9. Each toolkit can potentially \ufb01ll the performance\ngap with the best-performing one just by implementing a better model with properly \ufb01ne-tuned\nhyperparameters for the speci\ufb01c task. We thus think that the actual value of a toolkit mainly lies in its\nusability and \ufb02exibility, which are the main principles that guided the design of SpeechBrain.\nA.3\nAdditional tasks\nIn the following, we describe some of the supported applications not discussed in the main paper.\nA.3.1\nMulti-microphone signal processing\nMulti-microphone signal processing techniques are useful in different ways within a speech processing\npipeline. The information captured by different microphones can be used to estimate the direction\nof arrival (DOA) of a sound source. We can then use beamforming to enhance the target source.\nSpeechBrain performs multi-channel processing in the frequency domain. For both DOA estimation\nand beamforming, it is assumed that the spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) are computed for each\nfrequency bin k using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). We denote the SCMs for the target\nspeech, the interfering noise and the resulting mixture as RSS[k] \u2208CM\u00d7M, RNN[k] \u2208CM\u00d7M and\n7https://gdpr-info.eu\n8https://www.montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/\n17\nTable 9: Performance comparison across speech toolkits on common tasks.

The SCMs for\nspeech and noise can be obtained using time-frequency masks [56, 103, 104].\nThe DOA of the sound can be computed using the Generalized Cross-Correlation Phase Transform\n(GCC-PHAT) [57], the Steered-Response Power with Phase Transform (SRP-PHAT) [58], or the\nthe Multiple Signal Classi\ufb01cation (MUSIC) algorithm. All of these techniques are implemented\nin SpeechBrain using GPU-friendly functions. The GCC-PHAT computes the DOA on a pair of\nmicrophones and returns the time difference of arrival (TDOA), which can be mapped to a DOA on\nan arc from 0\u25e6to 180\u25e6. SRP-PHAT scans each potential DOA on a virtual unit sphere around the\narray and computes the corresponding power [105]. For each DOA (denoted by the unit vector u),\nthere is a steering vector A(k, u) \u2208CM\u00d71 in the direction of u:\nE(u) =\nM\nX\np=1\nM\nX\nq=p+1\nX\nk\nRp,q[k]\n|Rp,q[k]|Ap(k, u)Aq(k, u)\u2217\n(1)\nwhere Rp,q[k] stands for the element at the p-th row and q-th column in the SCM, and Ap(k, u)\nand Aq(k, u) stands for the p-th and q-th elements of the steering vector. The DOA u with the\nmaximum power E(u) is selected as the DOA of sound. It is worth mentioning that SRP-PHAT [58]\nis conceptually the same as another popular localization technique called Global Coherence Field\n(GCF) [106], which projects the DOA information into 2D or 3D plans. That will be possibly the\nobject of future implementation in SpeechBrain.\nIt is also possible to estimate the DOA using the Multiple Signal Classi\ufb01cation (MUSIC) algorithms\n[59]. MUSIC scans each potential direction of arrival on a virtual unit sphere around the array and\ncomputes the corresponding power. The matrix U(k) \u2208CM\u00d7S contains the S eigenvectors that\ncorrespond to the S smallest eigenvalues obtained while performing eigenvalue decomposition on the\n18\nSCM. The power corresponds to:\nE(u) =\nX\nk\nA(k, u)HA(k, u)\np\nA(k, u)HU(k)U(k)HA(k, u)\n(2)\nwhere {. . . }H stands for the Hermitian operator, and the DOA corresponds to the unit vector u\nassociated with the maximum value of E(u).\nSpeech can be enhanced with beamforming methods. The most straightforward approach consists of\nusing a delay-and-sum beamformer to produce constructive interference in the DOA of the target\nsound source. Beamforming generates frequency-wise coef\ufb01cients W(k) \u2208CM\u00d71 that multiply the\nSTFT of each microphone (X(t, k) \u2208CM\u00d7T ) and adds the products to produce the enhanced speech\nSTFT (Y (t, k) \u2208C1\u00d7T ):\nY (t, k) = WH(k)X(t, k)\n(3)\nWith delay-and-sum, the coef\ufb01cients are obtained using the steering vector as follows:\nW(k) = 1\nM A(k)\n(4)\nAlternatively, the Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamformer [55] exploits the\nDOA but also the SCMs, and generates the following coef\ufb01cients:\nW(k) =\nR\u22121\nXX(k)A(k)\nAH(k)R\u22121\nXX(k)A(k)\n(5)\nFinally, the Generalized Eigenvalue Decomposition (GEV) beamformer [56] extracts the principal\ncomponent using generalized eigenvalue decomposition using the speech and noise SCMs to generate\nthe coef\ufb01cients:\nRSS(k)W(k) = \u03bbRNN(k)W(k)\n(6)\nSpeech enhancement using beamforming methods is appealing for speech recognition as it improves\nthe signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) without introducing nonlinearities that might hurt the speech\nrecognition performance [107].\nA.3.2\nSpoken language understanding\nSpeechBrain has several recipes for spoken language understanding (SLU). The SLU recipes demon-\nstrate many useful capabilities of the toolkit, like combining pre-trained tokenizers, language models,\nand ASR models from other recipes, and using different input sources (audio or text) depending on\nwhether the model is training or testing.\nThere are currently recipes for three open-source SLU datasets with different levels of complexity:\nFluent Speech Commands (FSC) [54], Timers and Such [50], and SLURP [53]. The recipes all use\nattention-based RNN sequence-to-sequence models [108] to map the input (either the speech signal\nor a transcript) to the output (a semantic dictionary containing the intent/slots/slot values for the\nutterance, as a sequence of characters).\nThe recipes implement both \u201cconventional\u201d SLU (training on ground-truth transcripts) and \u201cend-to-\nend\u201d SLU (training on audio). The conventional \u201cdecoupled\u201d recipe uses the LibriSpeech ASR model\ndescribed in \u00a7 5.1.2 to transcribe the input signal at test time, instead of using the true transcript.\nThe \u201cmultistage\u201d [51] end-to-end recipe uses the same ASR model but during both training and\ntesting. The \u201cdirect\u201d [52] recipe uses a single model to map audio directly to semantics without an\nintermediate search step. For the ASR-based models, either the default LibriSpeech language model\nor a language model trained on the SLU dataset transcripts can be used.\nThe test accuracy for our FSC recipe is 99.60%, which is close to the recent SotA CTI model based on\nwav2vec 2.0 (99.7% in [109]). No comparisons for Timers and Such with other papers are available\n19\nTable 10: Performance on SLURP (audio as input).\nModel\nscenario\n(accuracy)\naction\n(accuracy)\nintent\n(accuracy)\nWord-F1\nChar-F1\nSLU-F1\nHerMiT [53]\n85.69\n81.42\n78.33\n69.34\n72.39\n70.83\nCTI [109]\n\u2014\n\u2014\n86.92\n\u2014\n\u2014\n74.66\nSpeechBrain Direct\n(CRDNN)\n82.15\n77.79\n75.64\n62.35\n66.45\n64.34\nSpeechBrain Direct\n(wav2vec 2.0)\n89.49\n86.40\n85.34\n72.60\n76.76\n74.62\nyet, as the dataset was only released recently [50]. The performance metrics for SLURP with audio\nas input are given in Table 10. Our direct recipe using a wav2vec 2.0 encoder outperforms the\nHerMiT baseline provided in the original SLURP paper [53] across all metrics. The recipe is slightly\nworse than SotA performance achieved by CTI for the intent accuracy metric and closely matches\nthe SLU-F1 metric reported in [109]. Note that unlike CTI, our recipe currently does not use NLU\npre-training and does not take advantage of an application-speci\ufb01c CRF architecture or word-aligned\nslot and slot value labels; instead, the recipe uses a very simple seq2seq model to predict the semantic\ndictionary directly. When this seq2seq model is applied directly to the ground-truth transcripts instead\nof audio, we achieve state-of-the-art results (Table 11).\nTable 11: Performance on SLURP (NLU / ground-truth transcripts as input).\nModel\nscenario\n(accuracy)\naction\n(accuracy)\nintent\n(accuracy)\nHerMiT [53]\n90.15\n86.99\n84.84\nCTI [109]\n\u2014\n\u2014\n87.73\nSpeechBrain NLU\n91.45\n89.46\n88.68\nA.4\nArchitecture details\nIn this section, we provide more details on the SpeechBrain architecture outlined in \u00a7 4.\nA.4.1\nData preparation\nThe goal of data preparation is to parse a dataset and create the data-manifest \ufb01les, which contain\nmeta-information about the input data (e.g., \ufb01le path, annotation, etc.). SpeechBrain data-io supports\nthe CSV and JSON \ufb01le formats, or the user can simply provide a dict. Listing 4 reports an excerpt of\na JSON data-manifest \ufb01le for speech recognition:\n1\n{\n2\n\"sentence001\": {\n3\n\"wav\": \"{data_root}/file_snt001.wav\",\n4\n\"length\": 2.10,\n5\n\"words\": \"SWITCH OFF THE LIGHT\"\n6\n},\n7\n}\nListing 4: An excerpt of a JSON data-manifest \ufb01le for speech recognition.\nWe use a dict (key-value map) structure where each example or spoken utterance is identi\ufb01ed and\naddressable by a unique key or example ID. The entries in each example vary by task and dataset. For\nexample, in speech recognition, audio \ufb01les and the corresponding text are needed, whereas, in source\nseparation, we would expect each example to contain the entries for mixture and sources signals. The\nCSV format can also be used:\n20\n1\nID,length,wav,words\n2\nsentence001,2.10,{data_root}/file_snt001.wav,\"SWITCH OFF THE LIGHT\"\n3\nsentence002,2.70,{data_root}/file_snt002.wav,\"SWITCH ON THE LIGHT\"\n4\nsentence003,3.20,{data_root}/file_snt003.wav,\"PLEASE, TURN OFF THE\nLIGHT\"\nListing 5: An excerpt of a CSV data-manifest \ufb01le for speech recognition.\nDataset parsing scripts, which create the data-manifest \ufb01les, are provided for many commonly-used\nspeech datasets. Since the data manifests can generally be made relative to the data directory root,\ndata-manifest \ufb01les can even be provided for download directly, skipping the dataset parsing. All\ndatasets and tasks tend to have at least small subtle differences in formats, and thus SpeechBrain does\nnot have any required entries besides the example ID.\nA.4.2\nHyperPyYAML details\nOur primary additions to the YAML format are addition of the following special tags, which are are\nadded before an item de\ufb01nition, and are pre\ufb01xed with ! :\n\u2022\n!new : instantiates python objects. The object is created with the arguments passed with a list\nfor positional arguments or as a dictionary for keyword arguments.\n\u2022\n!name : creates function objects. Behind the scenes, it uses functools.partial to create a new\nfunction de\ufb01nition with the default arguments provided.\n\u2022\n!ref : used for referring to a previously-de\ufb01ned item. It can support simple arithmetic and\nstring concatenation for basic hyperparameter combinations.\n\u2022\n!copy : used to perform a deep copy of a previosly de\ufb01ne object.\n\u2022\n!tuple : creates tuples.\n\u2022\n!include : used to insert other YAML \ufb01les.\n\u2022\n!apply : loads and executes a python function, storing the result.\nA.4.3\nData-io details\nSpeechBrain data-io is built to extend PyTorch data.utils and provides the user with several\nabstractions for reading, encoding, padding and batching data. It is designed with speech processing\nin mind speci\ufb01cally, but most of the problems it solves are general to variable-length sequence\nprocessing.\nMost of the data-io is built around four abstractions:\nDynamicItemDataset ,\nDynamicItem ,\nPaddedBatch and SaveableDataloader . SpeechBrain also provides a CategoricalEncoder class\nwhich implements label encoding for classi\ufb01cation tasks such as speaker recognition. The Speech-\nBrain data-io is illustrated in Figure 6.\nBased on a data-manifest (\ufb01le or dict), a DynamicItemDataset can be created.\n1 from speechbrain.dataio.dataset import DynamicItemDataset\n2 train_dataset = DynamicItemDataset.from_json(\"train.json\")\n3 val_dataset = DynamicItemDataset.from_json(\"val.json\")\nListing 6: DynamicItemDataset instantiation.\nEach entry in an example is an item, following the Python dict terminology. The items that the\ndata-manifest provides statically are called static items: they are kept in memory and stay unchanged.\nDynamic items are speci\ufb01ed by a transformation (e.g., a function) of any number of existing items.\nThese dynamic items are evaluated on-demand. A clear case is a dynamic item that takes a path to\nan audio \ufb01le and provides the loaded audio signal. Dynamic items can take other dynamic items as\ninputs, and a dependency graph is used to determine an evaluation order. Thus, another dynamic item\n21\n(optional)\n          Instantiate a\n DynamicItemDataset\n          and call \n   set_output_keys\n \nadd_dynamic_item\n         Define \n  a dynamic item \n Instantiate and fit a \nCategoricalEncoder\n   on the dataset\n        Instantiate a   \n  SaveAbleDataLoader\ncollate function\nPaddedBatch\nsampler\nReproducibleRandomSampler\n                     or       \n  DynamicBatchSampler\nCan be instantiated\nautomatically in the Brain\nclass\nFigure 6: An overview of SpeechBrain data-io.\ncould take the loaded audio signal and provide an augmented version. A GeneratorDynamicItem\ntakes any number of inputs and provides a chain of related dynamic items via the Python generator\nfunction syntax. Listings 7 and 8 show implementations of the aforementioned examples: \ufb01rst, a\ndynamic item loads an audio \ufb01le, and then a chain of dynamic items augment the loaded signal.\n1 @speechbrain.utils.data_pipeline.takes(\"file_path\")\n2 @speechbrain.utils.data_pipeline.provides(\"signal\")\n3 def audio_input(file_path):\n4\nsig = speechbrain.dataio.dataio.read_audio(file_path)\n5\nreturn sig\nListing 7: A dynamic item which loads an audio \ufb01le.\n1 import random\n2 speechbrain.utils.data_pipeline.takes(\"sig\")\n3 @speechbrain.utils.data_pipeline.provides(\"rgain\", \"rgain_offset\")\n4 def augmentation(sig):\n5\nrandom_gain_sig = sig*random.rand()\n6\nyield random_gain_sig\n7\nsig_with_offset = random_gain_sig + 1\n8\nyield sig_with_offset\nListing 8: Example of a chain of dynamic items, which augments the output of another dynamic item.\nThe user speci\ufb01es which items should be returned by the DynamicItemDataset. Items are evaluated\nlazily: only the strictly necessary operations for the user requested items are performed. This allows\nfor signi\ufb01cant computational savings and faster execution. For example in listing 9 only the example\nID (id) and speaker ID (spkid) static items and the random gain augmentation dynamic item (rgain)\nare requested.\n1 speechbrain.dataio.dataset.set_output_keys(\n2\n[train_dataset], [\"id , \"spkid\", \"rgain\"],\n3\n)\nListing 9: Setting output items for the train_dataset DynamicItemDataset\nSince the audio tensor with offset (rgain_offset) is not requested it is not computed at all in this\nexample. On the contrary the audio tensor sig is needed for computing rgain and thus it is evaluated.\nThe DynamicItemDataset can thus provide multiple different views of the same dataset on demand.\nIterating over the dataset can be extremely fast if the user only needs a particular item, e.g., to \ufb01t\na CategoricalEncoder . Listing 10 shows \ufb01tting a CategoricalEncoder in a speaker identi\ufb01cation\ntask, continuing the above examples.\n22\n1 from speechbrain.dataio.encoder import CategoricalEncoder\n2 spk_id_encoder = CategoricalEncoder ()\n3 spk_id_encoder.update_from_didataset(dataset , \"spkid\")\n4 train_dataset.add_dynamic_item(spk_id_encoder.encode_label , takes=\"\nspkid\", provides=\"spkid_enc\")\nListing 10: Fitting a CategoricalEncoder for speaker recognition. This only evaluates the spkid\nitem.\nSpeechBrain also provides CategoricalEncoder sub-classes for encoding text and handle special\ntokens for the training of sequence-to-sequence models.\nA DynamicItemDataset object can be wrapped by a standard PyTorch DataLoader or by Speech-\nBrain SaveableDataloader . The Brain class can handle this automatically for the user and uses\nthe SaveableDataloader by default with PaddedBatch as the default collate function. and inject-\ning ReproducibleRandomSampler as the sampler in case shuffle=True . More in general, custom\nPyTorch samplers and collate functions can be integrated seamlessly in SpeechBrain data-io.\nSaveableDataloader allows for intra-epoch checkpointing, a feature that is useful when running\nextremely computationally demanding experiments where each epoch can take several hours.\nPaddedBatch is both a collate function and a batch object. It handles for the user the rather annoying\ntask of padding examples together. By default, it batches together only PyTorch tensors by adding\nzeros to the right on the last dimension. Other data types are not batched together but, instead, are\nreturned in a python list. It also provides a semantically meaningful interface, as shown in listing 11.\n1 from speechbrain.dataio.dataloader import make_dataloader\n2 train_dataset.set_output_keys ([\"id\", \"rgain\"])\n3 dataloader = make_dataloader(train_dataset , batch_size =8)\n4 for batch in dataloader:\n5\n# Access a list of the example IDs in this batch\n6\nbatch.id\n7\n# Access the speech data:\n8\nbatch.rgain.data\n9\n# Access the relative lengths:\n10\nbatch.rgain.lengths\nListing 11: Accessing in PaddedBatch each requested item as well as the relative lengths of the\npadded data\nA.4.4\nBrain class details\nThe Brain class implements customizable methods for managing the different aspects of training\nand evaluation. Table 12 describes more in detail these useful methods.\nThe Brain class only takes the following arguments:\n\u2022\nmodules : takes a dictionary of PyTorch modules and converts it to a PyTorch ModuleDict .\nprovides a convenient way to move all parameters to the correct device, call train() and\neval() , and wrap the modules in the appropriate distributed wrapper if necessary.\n\u2022\nopt_class : takes a function de\ufb01nition for a PyTorch optimizer. The reason for choosing this\nas input rather than a pre-constructed PyTorch optimizer is that the Brain class automatically\nhandles wrapping the module parameters in distributed wrappers if requested. That needs to\nhappen before the parameters get passed to the optimizer constructor.\n\u2022\nhparams : accepts a dictionary of hyperparameters that will be accessible to all the internal\nmethods.\n23\nTable 12: Main methods implemented in the Brain class.\nMethod\nDescription\nfit\nMain function for training. It iterates epochs and datasets to improve the objective.\nfit_batch\nTrains a batch. It calls compute_forward , compute_objectives , and optimizes\nthe loss.\ncompute_forward\nDe\ufb01nes computations from input to output predictions.\ncompute_objective\nDe\ufb01nes computations from predictions to loss.\non_stage_start\nGets called at the beginning of a epoch. Useful for metric initialization.\non_stage_end\nGets called at the end of a epoch. Useful for statistics, checkpointing, learning rate\nannealing.\n\u2022\nrun_opts : there are a large number of options for controlling the execution details for the\nfit() method, that can all be passed via this argument. Some examples include enabling\ndebug mode, the execution device, and the distributed execution options.\n\u2022\ncheckpointer : it is a pointer to the SpeechBrain checkpointer. This way, at the beginning\nof training, the most recent checkpoint is loaded and training is resumed from that point. If\ntraining is \ufb01nished, this moves on to evaluation. During training, the checkpoints are saved\nevery 15 minutes by default. At the beginning of the evaluation, the \"best\" checkpoint is loaded,\nas determined by the lowest or highest score on a metric recorded in the checkpoints.\nA.4.5\nLobes\nIn neuroscience, the lobes are areas of the brain associated with some speci\ufb01c high-level functionality.\nSimilarly, in SpeechBrain we collect common higher-level speech processing functionalities in the\nlobe folder. For instance, lobes contain popular models used for speech processing, as reported in\nTable 13. Moreover, we implement here data augmentation strategies, as discussed in Table 14.\nA.4.6\nInference\nTo make inference with pre-trained models easier, we provide some inference classes able to support\na variety of speech tasks. For instance, it is possible to transcribe an input sentence using a speech\nrecognizer with just a few lines of code:\n1 from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderDecoderASR\n2\n3 asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(\n4\nsource=\"speechbrain/asr -transformer -transformerlm -librispeech\",\nsavedir=\"pretrained_models/asr\")\n5 asr_model.transcribe_file(\"example.wav\")\n6 >>> [\"THE BIRCH CANOE SLID ON THE SMOOTH PLANKS\"]\nListing 12: Inference with a speech recognizer.\nThe inference API relies on a YAML similar to that used for training.

Each corruption technique is randomly activated according\nto the speci\ufb01ed activation probabilities. The amount of noise added is controlled\nwith proper settings. When not speci\ufb01ed directly, we use the noise and impulse\nresponses from the OpenRIR dataseta.\nahttp://www.openslr.org/28/\nIn this case, we feed the veri\ufb01cation system with two audio \ufb01les, and the outcome is \"0\" if the \ufb01les\nare from different speakers and \"1\" otherwise. We have shared our best-performing models on the\nHugging Face hub9.\nA.5\nExperiment details\nIn the following, we provide more details on the datasets, evaluation metrics, and experimental\nsettings used in the experiments reported in the paper.\n9huggingface.co/speechbrain\n25\nA.5.1\nDatasets\nAs shown in Table 1, SpeechBrain already provides recipes for several common speech corpora10:\n\u2022 TIMIT [31]: The TIMIT corpus contains about 5 hours of speech from 630 speakers of eight\nmajor dialects of American English, each reading ten phonetically rich sentences. It includes\naudio signals sampled at 16kHz (16-bit) resolution and the phonetic transcription of each\nsentence using the SAMPA phoneme set. TIMIT is licensed by the Linguistic Data Consortium\n(LDC).\n\u2022 LibriSpeech [28]: LibriSpeech is a corpus of approximately 1000 hours of 16kHz read English\nspeech. The data is derived from audiobooks from the LibriVox project11. The volunteers gave\ntheir consent to donated their recordings to the public domain. The training data is split into\nthree partitions of 100hr, 360hr, and 500hr sets while the dev and test data are split into the\n\u2018clean\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 categories, respectively. Each of the dev and test sets is around 5hr. The\ncorpus is publicly available with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.\n\u2022 Common Voice [29]: Common Voice is Mozilla\u2019s initiative to create a free database for speech\nrecognition software. The project is supported by volunteers who record sample sentences with\na microphone and review recordings of other users. The website clearly informs the volunteers\nof the purpose of the recordings. The text is derived from different open-source text sources,\nincluding Wikipedia. As of May 2021, the dataset contains 7.3k hours of transcribed and\nvalidated speech in 60 languages. Our paper uses the latest released version of the corpus\n(Common Voice 6.1). The dataset is publicly available with the Creative Commons Attribution\n4.0 License.\n\u2022 VoxCeleb [35]: VoxCeleb is an audio-visual dataset consisting of short clips of human speech,\nextracted from interview videos uploaded to YouTube. In this paper, we used both VoxCeleb1\n[34] and voxceleb2 [35]. VoxCeleb1 contains over 100,000 utterances for 1,251 celebrities.\nVoxCeleb2 contains over a million utterances for 6,112 identities. The dataset is available to\ndownload under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n\u2022 AMI [38]: The AMI Meeting Corpus is a widely used multi-modal dataset consisting of 100\nhours of meeting recordings. The meetings have been recorded with both close-talking and\nfar-\ufb01eld microphones that are time-synchronized. The meetings are majorly divided into a\nscenario and non-scenario meetings. In a scenario meeting, four participants play a speci\ufb01c role\nassigned to them. The non-scenario ones, instead, include a general discussion between three\nto four participants. The AMI dataset also has \ufb01xed of\ufb01cial splits for various tasks to foster\nreplicability. The signals, transcription, and annotations, have been released publicly under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC BY 4.0).\n\u2022 Voicebank-DEMAND [96]: It contains speech of 30 clean speakers extracted from the Voice\nBank corpus [41]: 28 are included in the training set, and two are in the validation set. The noisy\nspeech is synthesized by contaminating the clean signals with noise from Diverse Environments\nMultichannel Acoustic Noise Database (DEMAND) [110]. Both speakers and noise conditions\nin the test set are unseen by the training set. The training and test set contains 11572 and\n824 noisy-clean speech pairs, respectively. The dataset is available to the community with the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.\n\u2022 WSJ0-mix [46]: It is a single-channel speech separation dataset derived from the Wall Street\nJournal corpus (licensed by LDC). It contains mixtures of two or three speakers. The training\nset consists of 30 hours of overlapped speech material that was generated by randomly selecting\nutterances by different speakers from the WSJ0 training set si_tr_s, and by mixing them at\nvarious signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).\n10The datasets used for our research are anonymized and do not contain personally identi\ufb01able information or\noffensive content. Datasets available through LDC require that participants consented to share their data in a\ncorpus. Unless explicitly mentioned, we were not able to \ufb01nd the consent information for the other datasets.\nHowever, we only use popular corpora, and we have reason to believe that creators explicitly asked for consent\nfrom the contributors.\n11https://librivox.org/\n26\nA.5.2\nEvaluation metrics\nSpeechBrain supports all the standard evaluation metrics needed to assess the performance of the\nproposed tasks. In the following, we report a short description of the evaluation metrics used in this\npaper:\n\u2022 Word Error Rate (WER%): The WER(%) is derived from the Levenshtein distance and\ncompares a reference and a hypothesized word-level transcription. It is computed by summing\nup the number of word insertions, deletions, substitutions and dividing it by the total number\nof words in the reference transcription. Listing 14 shows an example of the WER summary\nprovided by SpeechBrain, where the alignment between the reference and the hypothesized\ntranscription are provided as well.\n\u2022 Phone Error Rate (PER%): It is the same as the WER, but it is computed using phonemes as\nbasic units rather than words.\n\u2022 Equal Error Rate (EER%): It corresponds to the error rate achieved when the false acceptance\nrate and the false rejection rate are equal. The lower the EER is, the higher is the accuracy of\nthe system.\n\u2022 Diarization Error Rate (DER%): Diarization error rate (DER) is the standard metric for\nevaluating speaker diarization systems. It is de\ufb01ned as:\nDER = false alarm + missed + confusion\nreference length\n(7)\nwhere false alarm is the length of non-speech incorrectly classi\ufb01ed as speech, and missed\ndetection is the length of segments that are considered as speech in reference, but not in\nhypothesis. confusion is the length of segments that are assigned to different speakers in\nhypothesis and reference, while reference-length is the total duration of speech in the reference.\nThe lower DER is, the better the diarization system is.\n\u2022 Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ): It is a complex metric designed to predict\nsubjective opinion scores of a degraded audio sample [111]. PESQ (full reference modality)\ncompares the clean and noisy signals and returns a score from 4.5 to -0.5, with higher scores\nindicating better quality.\n\u2022 MOS predictor of overall signal quality (COVL): The COVL metric is part of a set of three\ncommon metrics of enhancement quality, along with CSIG and CBAK. These metrics are a\ncomposite of other commonly used metrics, like PESQ and Itakura-Saito distance measure. The\nresulting metric showed a much higher correlation with human judgments than any contributing\nmetric [112].\n\u2022 Scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio improvement (SI-SNRi): Scale-invariant signal-to-\nnoise ratio improvement (SI-SNRi) is a performance metric for source separation [43], proposed\nas an alternative to the Source-to-Distortion Ratio [113]. It is de\ufb01ned as follows:\nstarget :=(bs\u22a4s)s\n\u2225s\u22252 ,\nenoise :=bs \u2212starget,\nSI-SNR :=10 log10\n\u2225starget\u22252\n\u2225enoise\u22252 ,\nwhere s \u2208RT is the ground truth source, and bs \u2208RT is the source estimated by the model, and\n\u2225s\u22252 = s\u22a4s, denotes the l2 norm operation. The scale-invariance is ensured by removing the\nmean from s and bs, and dividing them by their respective standard deviations before calculating\nthe SNR. Finally, SI-SNR improvement, (SI-SNRi) is calculated as follows:\nSI-SNRi := SI-SNR(s, bs) \u2212SI-SNR(s, x),\nwhere x \u2208RT denotes the mixture signal corresponding to the source s.\n27\n1 %WER 2.46 [ 1291 / 52576, 169 ins , 124 del , 998 sub ]\n2 %SER 28.55 [ 748 / 2620 ]\n3 Scored 2620 sentences , 0 not present in hyp.\n4 =========================================\n5 ALIGNMENTS\n6\n7 Format:\n8 <utterance -id>, WER DETAILS\n9 <eps > ; reference\n; on ; the ; first ;\nline\n10\nI\n;\nS\n; =\n;\n=\n;\nS\n;\nD\n11\nand\n; hypothesis ; on ; the ; third ; <eps >\n12 =========================================\n13 61 -70968 -0058 , %WER 0.00 [ 0 / 5, 0 ins , 0 del , 0 sub ]\n14 WILL ; YOU ; FORGIVE ; ME ; NOW\n15\n=\n;\n=\n;\n=\n; =\n;\n=\n16 WILL ; YOU ; FORGIVE ; ME ; NOW\n17 =========================================\n18 5142 -33396 -0000 , %WER 20.00 [ 1 / 5, 0 ins , 0 del , 1 sub ]\n19 AT ; ANOTHER ; TIME ; HARALD ; ASKED\n20 =\n;\n=\n;\n=\n;\nS\n;\n=\n21 AT ; ANOTHER ; TIME ; HAROLD ; ASKED\n22 =========================================\n23 237 -134500 -0005 , %WER 11.11 [ 1 / 9, 0 ins , 1 del , 0 sub ]\n24 OH ; BUT ; I\u2019M ; GLAD ; TO ; GET ; THIS ; PLACE ; MOWED\n25 =\n;\n=\n;\n=\n;\n=\n; =\n;\n=\n;\n=\n;\n=\n;\nD\n26 OH ; BUT ; I\u2019M ; GLAD ; TO ; GET ; THIS ; PLACE ; <eps >\n27 =========================================\n28 260 -123288 -0012 , %WER 14.29 [ 1 / 7, 1 ins , 0 del , 0 sub ]\n29 THAT ; WILL ; BE ; <eps > ; SAFEST ; NO ; NO ; NEVER\n30\n=\n;\n=\n; =\n;\nI\n;\n=\n; =\n; =\n;\n=\n31 THAT ; WILL ; BE ;\nTHE\n; SAFEST ; NO ; NO ; NEVER\nListing 14: Excerpt of the summary \ufb01le generated by SpeechBrain for the WER metric described\nabove.\nA.5.3\nExperimental setups\nIn this section, we report more details for the experiments reported in the paper.

    "1706.03825": "SmoothGrad: removing noise by adding noise\nDaniel Smilkov 1 Nikhil Thorat 1 Been Kim 1 Fernanda Vi\u00b4egas 1 Martin Wattenberg 1\nAbstract\nExplaining the output of a deep network remains\na challenge. In the case of an image classi\ufb01er,\none type of explanation is to identify pixels that\nstrongly in\ufb02uence the \ufb01nal decision.\nA start-\ning point for this strategy is the gradient of the\nclass score function with respect to the input im-\nage. This gradient can be interpreted as a sensi-\ntivity map, and there are several techniques that\nelaborate on this basic idea. This paper makes\ntwo contributions: it introduces SMOOTHGRAD,\na simple method that can help visually sharpen\ngradient-based sensitivity maps, and it discusses\nlessons in the visualization of these maps. We\npublish the code for our experiments and a web-\nsite with our results.\n1. Introduction\nInterpreting complex machine learning models, such as\ndeep neural networks, remains a challenge. Yet an under-\nstanding of how such models function is important both\nfor building applications and as a problem in its own right.\nFrom health care domains (Hughes et al., 2016; Doshi-\nVelez et al., 2014; Lou et al., 2012) to education (Kim et al.,\n2015), there are many domains where interpretability is im-\nportant. For example, the pneumonia risk prediction case\nstudy in (Lou et al., 2012) showed that more interpretable\nmodels can reveal important but surprising patterns in the\ndata that complex models overlooked. For reviews of inter-\npretable models, see (Freitas, 2014; Doshi-Velez, 2017).\nOne case of interest is image classi\ufb01cation systems. Find-\ning an \u201cexplanation\u201d for a classi\ufb01cation decision could po-\ntentially shed light on the underlying mechanisms of such\nsystems, as well as helping in enhancing them. For ex-\nample, the technique of deconvolution helped researchers\nidentify neurons that failed to learn any meaningful fea-\ntures, knowledge that was used to improve the network, as\nin (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014).\n1Google Inc..\nCorrespondence to:\nDaniel Smilkov\n<smilkov@google.com>.\nCopyright 2017 by the author(s).\nA common approach to understanding the decisions of im-\nage classi\ufb01cation systems is to \ufb01nd regions of an image\nthat were particularly in\ufb02uential to the \ufb01nal classi\ufb01cation.\n(Baehrens et al., 2010; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Springen-\nberg et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2016; Selvaraju et al., 2016;\nSundararajan et al., 2017; Zintgraf et al., 2016). These ap-\nproaches (variously called sensitivity maps, saliency maps,\nor pixel attribution maps; see discussion in Section 2; use\nocclusion techniques or calculations with gradients to as-\nsign an \u201cimportance\u201d value to individual pixels which is\nmeant to re\ufb02ect their in\ufb02uence on the \ufb01nal classi\ufb01cation.\nIn practice these techniques often do seem to highlight re-\ngions that can be meaningful to humans, such as the eyes in\na face. At the same time, sensitivity maps are often visually\nnoisy, highlighting some pixels that\u2013to a human eye\u2013seem\nrandomly selected. Of course, a priori we cannot deter-\nmine if this noise re\ufb02ects an underlying truth about how\nnetworks perform classi\ufb01cation, or is due to more super\ufb01-\ncial factors. Either way, it seems like a phenomenon worth\ninvestigating further.\nThis paper describes a very simple technique, SMOOTH-\nGRAD, that in practice tends to reduce visual noise, and\nalso can be combined with other sensitivity map algo-\nrithms. The core idea is to take an image of interest, sam-\nple similar images by adding noise to the image, then take\nthe average of the resulting sensitivity maps for each sam-\npled image. We also \ufb01nd that the common regularization\ntechnique of adding noise at training time (Bishop, 1995)\nhas an additional \u201cde-noising\u201d effect on sensitivity maps.\nThe two techniques (training with noise, and inferring with\nnoise) seem to have additive effect; performing them to-\ngether yields the best results.\nThis paper compares the SMOOTHGRAD method to several\ngradient-based sensitivity map methods and demonstrates\nits effects. We provide a conjecture, backed by some em-\npirical evidence, for why the technique works, and why it\nmight be more re\ufb02ective of how the network is doing clas-\nsi\ufb01cation. We also discuss several ways to enhance visu-\nalizations of these sensitivity maps. Finally, we also make\nthe code used to generate all the \ufb01gures in this paper avail-\nable, along with 200+ examples of each compared method\non the web at https://goo.gl/EfVzEE.\narXiv:1706.03825v1  [cs.LG]  12 Jun 2017\nSharper sensitivity maps: removing noise by adding noise\n2. Gradients as sensitivity maps\nConsider a system that classi\ufb01es an image into one class\nfrom a set C. Given an input image x, many image classi\ufb01-\ncation networks (Szegedy et al., 2016; LeCun et al., 1998)\ncompute a class activation function Sc for each class c \u2208C,\nand the \ufb01nal classi\ufb01cation class(x) is determined by which\nclass has the highest score. That is,\nclass(x) = argmaxc\u2208C Sc(x)\nA mathematically clean way of locating \u201cimportant\u201d pixels\nin the input image has been proposed by several authors,\ne.g., (Baehrens et al., 2010; Simonyan et al., 2013; Erhan\net al., 2009). If the functions Sc are piecewise differen-\ntiable, for any image x one can construct a sensitivity map\nMc(x) simply by differentiating Mc with respect to the in-\nput, x. In particular, we can de\ufb01ne\nMc(x) = \u2202Sc(x)/\u2202x\nHere \u2202Sc represents the derivative (i.e. gradient) of Sc. In-\ntuitively speaking, Mc represents how much difference a\ntiny change in each pixel of x would make to the classi\ufb01ca-\ntion score for class c. As a result, one might hope that the\nresulting map Mc would highlight key regions.\nIn practice, the sensitivity map of a label does seem\nto show a correlation with regions where that label is\npresent (Baehrens et al., 2010; Simonyan et al., 2013).\nHowever, the sensitivity maps based on raw gradients are\ntypically visually noisy, as shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, as\nthis image shows, the correlations with regions a human\nwould pick out as meaningful are rough at best.\nFigure 1. A noisy sensitivity map, based on the gradient of the\nclass score for gazelle for an image classi\ufb01cation network. Lighter\npixels indicate partial derivatives with higher absolute values. See\nSection 3 for details on the visualization.\n2.1. Previous work on enhancing sensitivity maps\nThere are several hypotheses for the apparent noise in raw\ngradient visualizations. One possibility, of course, is that\nthe maps are faithful descriptions of what the network is do-\ning. Perhaps certain pixels scattered, seemingly at random,\nacross the image are central to how the network is making\na decision. On the other hand, it is also possible that using\nthe raw gradient as a proxy for feature importance is not\noptimal. Seeking better explanations of network decisions,\nseveral prior works have proposed modi\ufb01cations to the ba-\nsic technique of gradient sensitivity maps; we summarize a\nfew key examples here.\nOne issue with using the gradient as a measure of in-\n\ufb02uence is that an important feature may \u201csaturate\u201d the\nfunction Sc. In other words, it may have a strong effect\nglobally, but with a small derivative locally. Several ap-\nproaches, Layerwise Relevance Propagation (Bach et al.,\n2015), DeepLift (Shrikumar et al., 2017), and more recently\nIntegrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017), attempt to\naddress this potential problem by estimating the global im-\nportance of each pixel, rather than local sensitivity. Maps\ncreated with these techniques are referred to as \u201csaliency\u201d\nor \u201cpixel attribution\u201d maps.\nAnother strategy for enhancing sensitivity maps has been\nto change or extend the backpropagation algorithm itself,\nwith the goal of emphasizing positive contributions to the\n\ufb01nal outcome. Two examples are the Deconvolution (Zeiler\n& Fergus, 2014) and Guided Backpropagation (Springen-\nberg et al., 2014) techniques, which modify the gradients\nof ReLU functions by discarding negative values during the\nbackpropagation calculation. The intention is to perform a\ntype of \u201cdeconvolution\u201d which will more clearly show fea-\ntures that triggered activations of high-level units. Similar\nideas appear in (Selvaraju et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016),\nwhich suggest ways to combine gradients of units at multi-\nple levels.\nIn what follows, we provide detailed comparisons of\n\u201cvanilla\u201d gradient maps with those created by integrated\ngradient methods and guided backpropagation.\nA note\non terminology:\nalthough the terms \u201csensitivity map\u201d,\n\u201csaliency map\u201d, and \u201cpixel attribution map\u201d have been used\nin different contexts, in this paper, we will refer to these\nmethods collectively as \u201csensitivity maps.\u201d\n2.2. Smoothing noisy gradients\nThere is a possible explanation for the noise in sensitivity\nmaps, which to our knowledge has not been directly ad-\ndressed in the literature: the derivative of the function Sc\nmay \ufb02uctuate sharply at small scales. In other words, the\napparent noise one sees in a sensitivity map may be due\nto essentially meaningless local variations in partial deriva-\ntives. After all, given typical training techniques there is\nno reason to expect derivatives to vary smoothly. Indeed,\nthe networks in question typically are based on ReLU acti-\nvation functions, so Sc generally will not even be continu-\nSharper sensitivity maps: removing noise by adding noise\nously differentiable.\nFig. 2 gives example of strongly \ufb02uctuating partial deriva-\ntives. This \ufb01xes a particular image x, and an image pixel\nxi, and plots the values of \u2202Sc\n\u2202xi (t) as fraction of the maxi-\nmum entry in the gradient vector, maxi \u2202Sc\n\u2202xi (t), for a short\nline segment x + t\u03f5 in the space of images parameterized\nby t \u2208[0, 1]. We show it as a fraction of the maximum\nentry in order to verify that the \ufb02uctuations are signi\ufb01cant.\nThe length of this segment is small enough that the start-\ning image x and the \ufb01nal image x + \u03f5 looks the same to\na human. Furthermore, each image along the path is cor-\nrectly classi\ufb01ed by the model. The partial derivatives with\nrespect to the red, green, and blue components, however,\nchange signi\ufb01cantly.\nFigure 2. The partial derivative of Sc with respect to the RGB val-\nues of a single pixel as a fraction of the maximum entry in the\ngradient vector, maxi\n\u2202Sc\n\u2202xi (t), (middle plot) as one slowly moves\naway from a baseline image x (left plot) to a \ufb01xed location x + \u03f5\n(right plot). \u03f5 is one random sample from N(0, 0.012). The \ufb01-\nnal image (x + \u03f5) is indistinguishable to a human from the origin\nimage x.\nGiven these rapid \ufb02uctuations, the gradient of Sc at any\ngiven point will be less meaningful than a local average\nof gradient values. This suggests a new way to create im-\nproved sensitivity maps: instead of basing a visualization\ndirectly on the gradient \u2202Sc, we could base it on a smooth-\ning of \u2202Sc with a Gaussian kernel.\nDirectly computing such a local average in a high-\ndimensional input space is intractable, but we can compute\na simple stochastic approximation. In particular, we can\ntake random samples in a neighborhood of an input x, and\naverage the resulting sensitivity maps. Mathematically, this\nmeans calculating\n\u02c6\nMc(x) = 1\nn\nn\nX\n1\nMc(x + N(0, \u03c32))\nwhere n is the number of samples, and N(0, \u03c32) represents\nGaussian noise with standard deviation \u03c3. We refer to this\nmethod as SMOOTHGRAD throughout the paper.\n3. Experiments\nTo assess the SMOOTHGRAD technique, we performed a\nseries of experiments using a neural network for image\nclassi\ufb01cation (Szegedy et al., 2016; TensorFlow, 2017).\nThe results suggest the estimated smoothed gradient, \u02c6\nMc,\nleads to visually more coherent sensitivity maps than the\nunsmoothed gradient Mc, with the resulting visualizations\naligning better\u2013to the human eye\u2013with meaningful fea-\ntures.\nOur experiments were carried out using an Inception v3\nmodel (Szegedy et al., 2016) that was trained on the\nILSVRC-2013 dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015) and a\nconvolutional MNIST model based on the TensorFlow tu-\ntorial (TensorFlow, 2017).\n3.1. Visualization methods and techniques\nSensitivity maps are typically visualized as heatmaps.\nFinding the right mapping from a channel values at a pixel\nto a particular color turns out to be surprisingly nuanced,\nand can have a large effect on the resulting impression of\nthe visualization. This section summarizes some visualiza-\ntion techniques and lessons learned in the process of com-\nparing various sensitivity map work. Some of these tech-\nniques may be universally useful regardless of the choice\nof sensitivity map methods.\nAbsolute value of gradients\nSensitivity map algorithms often produce signed values.\nThere is considerable ambiguity in how to convert signed\nvalues to colors. A key choice is whether to represent pos-\nitive and negative values differently, or to visualize the ab-\nsolute value only. The utility of taking the absolute val-\nues of gradients or not depends on the characteristics of the\ndataset of interest. For example, when the object of inter-\nest has the same color across the classes (e.g., digits are\nalways white in MNIST digits (LeCun et al., 2010)), the\npositive gradients indicate positive signal to the class. On\nthe other hand, for ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al.,\n2015), we have found that taking the absolute value of the\ngradient produced clearer pictures. One possible explana-\ntion for this phenomenon is that the direction is context de-\npendent: many image recognition tasks are invariant under\ncolor and illumination changes. For instance, in classifying\na ball, a dark ball on a bright background would have nega-\ntive gradient, while white ball on darker background would\nhave a positive gradient.\nCapping outlying values\nAnother property of the gradient that we observe is the\npresence of few pixels that have much higher gradients than\nthe average. This is not a new discovery \u2014 this property\nwas utilized in generating adversarial examples that are in-\nSharper sensitivity maps: removing noise by adding noise\nFigure 3. Effect of noise level (columns) on our method for 5 images of the gazelle class in ImageNet (rows). Each sensitivity map is\nobtained by applying Gaussian noise N(0, \u03c32) to the input pixels for 50 samples, and averaging them. The noise level corresponds to\n\u03c3/(xmax \u2212xmin).\ndistinguishable to humans (Szegedy et al., 2013). These\noutlying values have the potential to throw off color scales\ncompletely. Capping those extreme values to a relatively\nhigh value (we \ufb01nd 99th percentile to be suf\ufb01cient) leads\nto more visually coherent maps as in (Sundararajan et al.,\n2017). Without this post-processing step, maps may end up\nalmost entirely black.\nMultiplying maps with the input images\nSome techniques create a \ufb01nal sensitivity map by multiply-\ning gradient-based values and actual pixel values (Shriku-\nmar et al., 2017; Sundararajan et al., 2017). This multipli-\ncation does tend to produce visually simpler and sharper\nimages, although it can be unclear how much of this can\nbe attributed to sharpness in the original image itself. For\nexample, a black/white edge in the input can lead to an\nedge-like structure on the \ufb01nal visualization even if the un-\nderlying sensitivity map has no edges.\nHowever, this may result in undesired side effect. Pixels\nwith values of 0 will never show up on the sensitivity map.\nFor example, if we encode black as 0, the image of a clas-\nsi\ufb01er that correctly predicts a black ball on a white back-\nground will never highlight the black ball in the image.\nOn the other hand, multiplying gradients with the input im-\nages makes sense when we view the importance of the fea-\nture as their contribution to the total score, y. For example,\nin a linear system y = Wx, it makes sense to consider xiwi\nas the contribution of xi to the \ufb01nal score y.\nFor these reasons, we show our results with and without the\nimage multiplication in Fig. 5.\n3.2. Effect of noise level and sample size\nSMOOTHGRAD has two hyper-parameters: \u03c3, the noise\nlevel or standard deviation of the Gaussian perturbations,\nand n, the number of samples to average over.\nNoise, \u03c3\nFig. 3 shows the effect of noise level for several example\nimages from ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015). The 2nd\ncolumn corresponds to the standard gradient (0% noise),\nwhich we will refer to as the \u201cVanilla\u201d method throughout\nthe paper. Since quantitative evaluation of a map remains\nan unsolved problem, we again focus on qualitative eval-\nuation. We observe that applying 10%-20% noise (middle\ncolumns) seems to balance the sharpness of sensitivity map\nand maintain the structure of the original image.We also\nobserve that while this range of noise gives generally good\nresults for Inception, the ideal noise level depends on the\ninput. See Fig. 10 for a similar experiment on the MNIST\ndataset.\nSample size, n\nIn Fig. 4 we show the effect of sample size, n. As ex-\npected, the estimated gradient becomes smoother as the\nSharper sensitivity maps: removing noise by adding noise\nsample size, n, increases. We empirically found a dimin-\nishing return \u2014 there was little apparent change in the vi-\nsualizations for n > 50.\n3.3. Qualitative comparison to baseline methods\nSince there is no ground truth to allow for quantitative eval-\nuation of sensitivity maps, we follow prior work (Simonyan\net al., 2013; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Springenberg et al.,\n2014; Selvaraju et al., 2016; Sundararajan et al., 2017) and\nfocus on two aspects of qualitative evaluation.\nFirst, we inspect visual coherence (e.g., the highlights are\nonly on the object of interest, not the background). Second,\nwe test for discriminativity, where in an image with both a\nmonkey and a spoon, one would expect an explanation for\na monkey classi\ufb01cation to be concentrated on the monkey\nrather than the spoon, and vice versa.\nRegarding visual coherence, Fig. 5 shows a side-by-side\ncomparison between our method and three gradient-based\nmethods: Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017),\nGuided BackProp (Springenberg et al., 2014) and vanilla\ngradient. Among a random sample of 200 images that we\ninspected, we found SMOOTHGRAD to consistently pro-\nvide more visually coherent maps than Integrated Gradi-\nents and vanilla gradient. While Guided BackProp pro-\nvides the most sharp maps (last three rows of Fig. 5), it\nis prone to failure (\ufb01rst three rows of Fig. 5), especially\nfor images with uniform background. On the contrary, our\nobservation is that SMOOTHGRAD has the highest impact\nwhen the object is surrounded with uniform background\ncolor (\ufb01rst three rows of Fig. 5). Exploring this difference\nis an interesting area for investigation. It is possible that\nthe smoothness of the class score function may be related\nto spatial statistics of the underlying image; noise may have\na differential effect on the sensitivity to different textures.\nFig. 6 compares the discriminativity of our method to other\nmethods. Each image has at least two objects of different\nclasses that the network may recognize. To visually show\ndiscriminativity, we compute the sensitivity maps M1(x)\nand M2(x) for both classes, scale both to [0, 1], and calcu-\nlate the difference M1(x) \u2212M2(x). We then plot the val-\nues on a diverging color map [\u22121, 0, 1] 7\u2192[blue, gray, red].\nFor these images, SMOOTHGRAD qualitatively shows bet-\nter discriminativity over the other methods. It remains an\nopen question to understand which properties affect the dis-\ncriminativity of a given method \u2013 e.g. understanding why\nGuided BackProp seems to show the weakest discrimina-\ntivity.\n3.4. Combining SmoothGrad with other methods\nOne can think of SMOOTHGRAD as smoothing the vanilla\ngradient method using a simple procedure: averaging the\nvanilla sensitivity maps of n noisy images. With that in\nmind, the same smoothing procedure can be used to aug-\nment any gradient-based method. In Fig. 7 we show the\nresults of applying SMOOTHGRAD in combination with In-\ntegrated Gradients and Guided BackProp. We observe that\nthis augmentation improves the visual coherence of sensi-\ntivity maps for both methods.\nFor further analysis, we point the reader to our web page\nat https://goo.gl/EfVzEE with sensitivity maps of\n200+ images and four different methods.\n3.5. Adding noise during training\nSMOOTHGRAD as discussed so far may be applied to clas-\nsi\ufb01cation networks as-is. In situations where there is a pre-\nmium on legibility, however, it is natural to ask whether\nthere is a similar way to modify the network weights so\nthat its sensitivity maps are sharper. One idea that is par-\nallel in some ways to SMOOTHGRAD is the well-known\nregularization technique of adding noise to samples during\ntraining (Bishop, 1995). We \ufb01nd that the same method also\nimproves the sharpness of the sensitivity map.\nFig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the effect of adding noise at training\ntime and/or evaluation time for the MNIST and Inception\nmodel respectively. Interestingly, adding noise at training\ntime seems to also provide a de-noising effect on the sensi-\ntivity map. Lastly, the two techniques (training with noise,\nand inferring with noise) seem to have additive effect; per-\nforming them together produces the most visually coherent\nmap of the 4 combinations.\n4. Conclusion and future work\nThe experiments described here suggest that gradient-\nbased sensitivity maps can be sharpened by two forms of\nsmoothing. First, averaging maps made from many small\nperturbations of a given image seems to have a signi\ufb01cant\nsmoothing effect. Second, that effect can be enhanced fur-\nther by training on data that has been perturbed with ran-\ndom noise.\nThese results suggest several avenues for future research.\nFirst, while we have provided a plausibility argument for\nour conjecture that noisy sensitivity maps are due to noisy\ngradients, it would be worthwhile to look for further evi-\ndence and theoretical arguments that support or discon\ufb01rm\nthis hypothesis. It is certainly possible that the sharpening\neffect of SMOOTHGRAD has other causes, such as a differ-\nential effect of random noise on different textures.\nSecond, in addition to training with noise, there may be\nmore direct methods to create systems with smoother class\nscore functions. For example, one could train with an ex-\nplicit penalty on the size of partial derivatives. To create\nSharper sensitivity maps: removing noise by adding noise\nFigure 4.

First three (last three) rows show examples where applying SMOOTHGRAD had\nhigh (low) impact on the quality of sensitivity map.\nSharper sensitivity maps: removing noise by adding noise\nFigure 6. Discriminativity of different methods. For each image, we visualize the difference scale(\u2202y1/\u2202x) \u2212scale(\u2202y2/\u2202x) where y1\nand y2 are the logits for the \ufb01rst and the second class (i.e., cat or dog) and scale() normalizes the gradient values to be between [0, 1].\nThe values are plotted using a diverging color map [\u22121, 0, 1] 7\u2192[blue, gray, red]. Each method is represented in columns.\nFigure 7.

Effect of adding noise during training vs evaluation for\nInception.\nmore spatial coherent maps, one could add a penalty for\nlarge differences in partial derivatives of the class score\nwith respect to neighboring pixels. It may also be worth\ninvestigating the geometry of the class score function to\nunderstand why smoothing seems to be more effective on\nimages with large regions of near-constant pixel values.\nA further area for exploration is to \ufb01nd better metrics for\ncomparing sensitivity maps. To measure spatial coherence,\none might use existing databases of image segmentations,\nand we are already making progress (Oh et al., 2017; Sel-\nvaraju et al., 2016). Systematic measurements of discrimi-\nnativity could also be valuable. Finally, a natural question\nis whether the de-noising techniques described here gener-\nalize to other network architectures and tasks.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Chris Olah for generously sharing his code and\nhelpful discussions, including pointing out the relation to\ncontractive autoencoders, and Mukund Sundararajan and\nQiqi Yan for useful discussions.\nReferences\nBach, Sebastian, Binder, Alexander, Montavon, Gr\u00b4egoire,\nKlauschen,\nFrederick,\nM\u00a8uller,\nKlaus-Robert,\nand\nSamek, Wojciech.

    "2308.12734": "REAL-TIME DETECTION OF AI-GENERATED SPEECH FOR\nDEEPFAKE VOICE CONVERSION\nJordan J. Bird, Ahmad Lotfi\nNottingham Trent University\nNottingham, UK\n{jordan.bird, ahmad.lotfi}@ntu.ac.uk\nABSTRACT\nThere are growing implications surrounding generative AI in the speech domain that enable voice\ncloning and real-time voice conversion from one individual to another. This technology poses a\nsignificant ethical threat and could lead to breaches of privacy and misrepresentation, thus there is\nan urgent need for real-time detection of AI-generated speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion. To\naddress the above emerging issues, the DEEP-VOICE dataset is generated in this study, comprised of\nreal human speech from eight well-known figures and their speech converted to one another using\nRetrieval-based Voice Conversion. Presenting as a binary classification problem of whether the\nspeech is real or AI-generated, statistical analysis of temporal audio features through t-testing reveals\nthat there are significantly different distributions. Hyperparameter optimisation is implemented for\nmachine learning models to identify the source of speech. Following the training of 208 individual\nmachine learning models over 10-fold cross validation, it is found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting\nmodel can achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.3% and can classify speech in real-time,\nat around 0.004 milliseconds given one second of speech. All data generated for this study is released\npublicly for future research on AI speech detection.\nKeywords DeepFake Detection \u00b7 Generative AI \u00b7 Speech Recognition \u00b7 Audio Signal Processing \u00b7 Voice Cloning\n1\nIntroduction\nThe implications of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years are rapidly growing in importance. State-\nof-the-art systems capable of converting a speaker\u2019s voice to another in real-time via a microphone and sophisticated\ndeep learning models. The ability to clone an individual\u2019s speech and use it during an online or phone call is no longer\nscience fiction, and is possible using consumer-level computing technology.\nAlthough this technology may prove attractive for entertainment purposes, advancements in the field pose a significant\nsecurity threat. Human beings use voice as a method of recognising others in social situations and often go unquestioned.\nVoice recognition is also used for biometric authentication, and thus voice conversion could be used unethically to\nbreach privacy and security. In this case, the potential for misrepresentation and identity theft are enabled, which\nrequires immediate solutions from the scientific literature.\nThe scientific contributions of this work are threefold: first, the provision of an original audio classification dataset\ncomprised of 8 well-known public figures, with real audio collected from the internet and AI-generated speech via\nRetrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC). Second, the statistical analysis of extracted audio features to explore which\nsets of features are statistically significant given the classification of human or AI-generated speech. Third, the\nhyperparameter optimisation of statistical Machine Learning (ML) models towards improving accuracy and inference\ntime, in order to achieve real-time recognition of AI-generated speech. The real-time models presented by this study are\nimportant for real-world use, and could be used, for example, to provide a warning system for individuals on phonecalls\nor in conference calls, where a synthetic voice may be part of the conversation with nefarious aims.\narXiv:2308.12734v1  [cs.SD]  24 Aug 2023\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nThis research article also contributes the DEEP-VOICE1 dataset to enable the analysis of AI-generated speech.\nThe datasets collected and generated for this study are released publicly for the research community to facilitate\ninterdisciplinary work on the analysis and recognition of AI-generated speech patterns. This study also explores\nML-based countermeasures against synthetic speech impersonation.\nThe remainder of this study is as follows, Section 2 first explores the scientific literature relevant to this study before\nSection 3 outlines the methodology followed by the experiments in this work. The experimental results are then\npresented and discussed in Section 4. Finally, this work is concluded along with suggestions for future work due to the\nfindings of these studies in Section 5.\n2\nBackground\nThis section explores related work in the field, providing background information on deepfakes and synthetic media, as\nwell as their detection. Finally, this section discusses how the literature has influenced the methodological design of the\nexperiments in this work.\nDeep Learning Fakes (DeepFakes) describe a category of algorithms which can generate synthetic media with the\npurpose of replacing an individual\u2019s likeness with another [1]. This form of synthetic media leads to many social,\nethical, and legal issues regarding trustworthiness in data, and can be used to portray a human being doing or saying\nsomething that they did not, in reality [2, 3]. The most common examples of DeepFakes are through images, oftentimes\nreplacing one\u2019s face with another where the second person is engaging in an activity that the victim did not [4]. Truby\nand Brown describe digital human clones as the Holy Grail of Artificial Intelligence [5], noting that human behaviour\nbecoming a commodity has led to the evolution of digital clones being sought on an industrial level. Truby and Brown\u2019s\nlegal and ethical study also noted that Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation provides a legislative example for\nother juristictions to prevent unauthorised digital cloning of individuals given their harmful potential. Rapid advances\nin synthetic media have enabled many other forms of digital cloning, and this study focusses on the replication of a\nvoice and its detection.\nAudio visual cloning was notably suggested in 2001 by Beard [6] as a method to replicate an actor within a film after\nthey have died. This could be in the form of an insurance policy given that an individual may not finish a film, or to\nlicense the likeness of an actor within their estate. Thus, this concept is closely related to the idea of digital immortality,\nwhich is the digital replication of a posthumous human being [7].\nIn 2018, Buzzfeed used an application called FakeApp to replace the face and voice of comedian Jordan Peele with\nthat of US President Barack Obama [8]. Although presenting as a comedy sketch, the video brought much attention to\nthe realistic nature of synthetic media. It is noted that only several minutes of example speech were needed to transfer\nstyle. As of the time of writing, five years of research have continued the field, with enhanced methods passing into and\nbeyond the uncanny valley [9, 10, 11].\nGoogle introduced a speech synthesis model named Tacotron in 2017 [12], and subsequent research introduced prosody\n[13] (intonation and stress), style control[14], multi-speaker synthesis [15], among many more advances. Noting this\ngrowing increase in quality and, as such, misplaced trust, researchers also explore how synthesised speech can be\ndetected. In 2022, Lim, Suk-Young and Lee [16] proposed Convolutional and Temporal models for detection. This\nstudy showed that the speech generated from Tacotron sometimes showed a relatively flatter spectrogram without\nrandomness as could be observed in human speech. Researchers conjecture that this may be due to the absence of\naccents in LJSpeech (the base tacotron dataset) rather than an inability of the pipeline itself. The study showed that\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural networks could score around\n97-99% accuracy when dealing with recognition. It must be noted that temporal convolutional approaches are relatively\ncomputationally expensive.\nSimilarly, studies in [17] showed that a residual CNN achieved the lowest error rate for the ASVspoof 2019 challenge\nat 4.04%, and later this was reduced to 1.26%. Mcuba et al. [18] also explored a similar problem, and implemented\nvarious convolutional neural networks to learn from images generated from chromagrams, spectrograms, mel-spectrum,\nand mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. This study found that a VGG-16 CNN with an Adadelta optimiser was around\n85.91% accurate for deepfake detection. Furthermore, prior results found several models to score in the 40-60% range,\nsuggesting that the recent advancements in deepfake speech lead to difficulty in their detection. Conti et al. [19] propose\nthat high-level features from Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) are indicative of generative speech. The experiments\nwere tested on the ASVSpoof2019 dataset [20] and showed that transfer learning from the SER model enabled better\nclassificaiton results for neural speech detection.\n1The data used in this study is available from:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/deep-voice-deepfake-voice-recognition\n2\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nEnd\nUser\nInput Audio\nAudio\nSource Audio\ne.g. conference call\nML\nModel\nNotify\nFake\nReal\n1 Second Blocks\nFeature\nExtraction\n(1 second)\nFigure 1: Usage of the real-time system.

Algorithms\nsuch as CNN and LSTM, and their fused counterpart, show effectiveness but are complex. Thus, for the consumer,\nthese algorithms will likely not infer data in real-time. For that reason, this study will also focus on the optimisation of\nstatistical algorithms, considering the inference time alongside ability.\n3\nMethod\nThis section provides an overview of the methodology followed in this work. An overview of data collection and\npreprocessing is provided before details on the DeepFake voice conversion approach employed. Following this, details\nof the ML models and their optimisation are provided. Finally, details of the hardware and software used for these\nexperiments are described for the purposes of replicability.\nThe research question for this study is how to detect Synthetic Speech in real-time and inform the end-user accordingly.\nThe diagram illustrated in Figure 1 shows a use case that the proposed system could be implemented. The source audio,\nsuch as a phone or conference call, is processed and classified. If the audio is predicted to contain AI-generated speech,\nthe end user is notified.\n3.1\nData Collection and Preprocessing\nEight individuals are selected, each with a source for the basis of real speech and data to be converted to AI-generated\nspeech. Table 1 provides the speech sources. In total, 62 minutes and 22 seconds of speech are collected from eight\nindividuals. Audio tracks are limited to a maximum of ten minutes. As can be observed, some of the tracks have\nmore background noise than others, such as cheering from supporters during Presidential victory speeches. Some of\nthe speech tracks are of production-level quality, such as the Stepping Down Monologue spoken by Linus Sebastian,\nwhereas others are of lower quality, an example being Elon Musk\u2019s Commencement Speech which was recorded at a\ndistance without studio-quality hardware. The tracks are chosen based on these attributes to provide variation within the\ndataset.\n3\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nReal Speech\n2 Stem\nSplitter\nReal Vocals\nAccompaniment\nRVC\nModel\nFake Vocals\nFake Speech\nFigure 2: Overview of the Retrieval-based Voice Conversion process to generate DeepFake speech with Ryan Gosling\u2019s\nspeech converted to Margot Robbie. Conversion is run on the extracted vocals before being layered on the original\nbackground ambience.\nAn example of voice conversion from real to fake speech can be found in Figure 2. First, the real speech is split via the\ntwo-stem model [21] from Spleeter, which is an encoder-decoder Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a U-Net\narchitecture. The model consists of 12 layers, with 6 layers each for the encoder and decoder networks. Following\nsplitting of the real vocals and accompaniment tracks, the vocals are then converted using a Retrieval-based Voice\nConversion (RVC) model to another individual. Finally, the original accompaniment and the RVC vocals are combined\nto form a fake speech track. The reason for splitting the tracks is so the style of the deepfake voice is not converted to\nany background noise, such as audience cheers or laughter. That is, the aim of this approach is to preserve ambient\nsounds while converting only the speaker\u2019s voice.\nThe aforementioned style conversion process is performed on each of the audio tracks gathered and cropped from Table\n1, and features are extracted for every 1-second of audio signal. In total, 26 features are extracted. Further information\nabout the feature extraction can be found in [22]. Those features include the Chromagram, which can be calculated\nfrom the Short-Time Fourier Transform X of a signal at frame m and frequency bin k:\nSG(m, k) = |X(m, k)|,\n(1)\nand then normalising the Chroma Bands which are spectrogram bins into, also known as chroma bands. From this, the\nSpectral Centroid SC can then be calculated, which is the location of the centre of mass in the spectrum:\nSC(m) =\nP\nk k \u00b7 SG(m, k)\nP\nk SG(m, k) .\n(2)\n2Victory Speech by Joe Biden: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfNYztas2c Last accessed: 07/23\n3Golden Globes Speech by Ryan Gosling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8JLyUW_MSw Last accessed: 07/23\n4Commencement Speech by Elon Musk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxZpaJK74Y4 Last accessed: 07/23\n5Victory Speech by Barack Obama: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeCY-jKpoZ0 Last accessed: 07/23\n6BAFTAs Speech by Margot Robbie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JA3_QBfjG8 Last accessed: 07/23\n7Stepping Down Monologue by Linus Sebastian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vuzqunync8 Last accessed: 07/23\n8Women in Music Speech by Taylor Swift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVpkFb9-fts Last accessed: 07/23\n9Victory Speech by Donald Trump: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsvy10D5rtc Last accessed: 07/23\n4\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nSimilarly, the Spectral Bandwidth SB, which is the difference in frequencies around the centroid, is calculated as:\nSB(m) =\nsP\nk(k \u2212SC(m))2 \u00b7 SG(m, k)\nP\nk SG(m, k)\n.\n(3)\nThe Spectral Rolloff (SR) is calculated via the frequency below 85% of the total spectral energy. Following the spectral\nfeatures, the Zero Crossing Rate ZCR is measured by observing the rate at which the signal (containing N samples)\nchanges sign via the sign function sgn. That is, how often the signal crosses x = 0 and changes from positive to\nnegative or vice-versa:\nZCR(m) =\n1\n2N\nN\u22121\nX\nn=1\n|sgn(x[n]) \u2212sgn(x[n \u22121])|.\n(4)\nThe Root Mean Square RMS is then calculated from audio signal x[n] at frame m:\nRMS(m) =\nv\nu\nu\nt 1\nN\nN\u22121\nX\nn=0\nx[n]2.\n(5)\nFinally, the first 20 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are calculated. The powers of the Short-Time Fourier\nTransform are mapped to the Mel-scale by applying a triangular window. Each of the log is taken from the power\nspectrum, and a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied.\nGiven that every individual is used to generate seven fake tracks, there is an extreme data imbalance. For this reason,\nthe data is balanced at a 1:1 ratio between real and fake speech by undersampling the data belonging to the fake class.\nA sample equal to the length of the real data is selected at random and used in the following methodology.\n3.2\nDeepFake Voice Conversion\nThe approach selected for converting speech is the RVC model10, which is based on the VITS architecture [23]. VITS is\nan adversarially trained Conditional Variational Autoencoder, originally intended for Text-to-Speech. Pitch estimation\nfrom the input speech is determined through the CREPE model [24], which is a deep CNN model. While the approach\nachieves competitive state-of-the-art voice conversion results, RVC is also chosen due to its ability to quickly convert\nshort speech samples, leading to the possibility of it being used in real-time. That is, a microphone can be used as an\ninput source to the model, enabling individuals to convert their voice to another\u2019s during a call.\nModels for the individuals studied in this work are retrieved from the Huggingface Model Hub11 following a search\nwithin the AI Hub Discord server, which provides search functionality12. For diversity, both male and female voices are\nselected from a range of public figures. Selected for this study are RVC version 2 models trained on the current and\nformer two United States Presidents, Joe Biden (500 epochs), Donald Trump (600 epochs), and Barack Obama (300\nepochs). Public figures included Elon Musk (350 epochs) and Linus Sebastian (300 epochs). Singers included Taylor\nSwift (300 epochs). Finally, two actors were chosen, Ryan Gosling (350 epochs) and Margot Robbie (350 epochs).\n3.3\nMachine Learning Model\nFollowing the feature extraction from each 1-second block of audio, this study then implements a range of various ML\nmodels. The goal of the models is to perform binary classification of the speech, learning whether the audio is speech\nspoken naturally by a human being, or has been, tampered with by retrieval-based voice conversion. The models are\nchosen from a range of different statistical approaches for comparison.\nThe models trained are: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) [25], Random Forests [26], Quadratic and Linear\nDiscriminant analyses [27], Ridge Regression [28] (linear regression with L2 regularisation), Gaussian and Bernoulli\nNaive Bayes [29], K-Nearest Neighbours [30], Support Vector Machines [31], Stochastic Gradient Descent [32], and\n10Implementation of RVC can be found at: https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversio\nn-WebUI\n11Information on Huggingface Model Hub can be found at: https://huggingface.co/models\n12Information on the AI Hub can be found at: https://discord.me/aihub\n5\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nGaussian Process [33]. Along with classification metrics, inference time is also considered, since detection of AI-\ngenerated speech may be useful in real-time during a conference or phone call. The average inference time is calculated\nby measuring and averaging the inference time of 1000 random data objects within the dataset. Towards hyperparameter\noptimisation, the XGBoost and Random Forests are optimised through a linear search of {10, 20, 30, ..., 500} boosting\nrounds and forest sizes, respectively. The K-Nearest Neighbor problem space is searched in a similar fashion, with the\nneighbour ensembles being sized {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}.\nAlong with classical accuracy, further metrics are also considered for model comparison. These are precision, which\nmeasures the rate at which predicted positives are correct among all positive predictions, and allows for false-positive\nanalysis:\nPrecision =\nTrue positives\nTrue positives + False positives.\n(6)\nPrecision is important since a high precision would minimise false accusations of AI-generated speech when the audio\nis, in fact, natural voice. Similarly, recall which is a measure of how many positive cases are correctly predicted, which\nenables analysis of false-negative predictions:\nRecall =\nTrue positives\nTrue positives + False negatives.\n(7)\nHigher recall suggests that the model is not falsely classifying AI-generated speech as human speech. These results are\nthen combined to compute the F-1 score:\nF1 score = 2 \u00d7 Precision \u00d7 Recall\nPrecision + Recall.\n(8)\nThe Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is then considered, which is a metric that considers all potential correct\nand incorrect predictions, calculated as:\nMCC =\nT \u00d7 TN \u2212FP \u00d7 FN\np\n(TP + FP) \u00d7 (TP + FN) \u00d7 (TN + FP) \u00d7 (TN + FN)\n.\n(9)\nMCC is measured in the range of -1 to 1. -1 is the complete disagreement between predictions and labels, +1 is a perfect\nclassifier, and an MCC of 0 suggests random predictions.\nFinally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) is calculated. The ROC AUC is\nimportant for probabilistic approaches to class prediction, since it is a test of predictive ability across probability\nthresholds. The ROC is a plot of recall and false positives given these thresholds, and the AUC is the measurement of\nthe area under the plotted curve. The metric is ranged from 0 to 1, where 0.5 is a random classifier and 1 is perfect.\nEach model is trained over 10-fold cross validation, with data splits set for replicability and direct comparison via a\nrandom seed of 42.\n3.4\nExperimental Hardware and Software\nAll experiments in this study were trained and executed on an Intel Core i7 CPU with a clock speed of 3.7GHz. Voice\nconversion was executed on a GPU due to the use of the CREPE algorithm, and an Nvidia RTX 2080Ti was used (4,352\nCUDA cores). The features were extracted from audio using the Librosa[22] library, and ML models were implemented\nwith scikit-learn[34].\n4\nResults and Observations\nThis section contains the observations made and results found within the experiments.\n4.1\nDataset Analysis\nPrior to implementation of Machine Learning, Table 2 shows the observed statistics between each the real and fake\ndatasets. It can be seen that there are large differences between some of the attributes, for example, the mean Spectral\n6\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nTable 2: Observed statistics in the dataset between the two classes of data.\nAttribute\nReal\nFake\nMean\nMed.\nStd.\nMean\nMed.\nStd.\nChromagram\n0.41\n0.40\n0.07\n0.43\n0.43\n0.07\nRoot Mean\nSquare\n0.04\n0.03\n0.03\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\nSpectral\nCentroid\n2541.34\n2353.97\n1,253.73\n2897.06\n2,762.58\n800.40\nSpectral\nBandwidth\n2883.99\n2806.94\n1,080.81\n3216.61\n3193.74\n545.97\nRolloff\n4683.44\n4094.33\n2602.42\n5271.79\n5061.05\n1572.49\nZero\nCrossing Rate\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.08\n0.07\n0.03\nMFCC 1\n-376.65\n-354.28\n84.12\n-388.48\n-378.02\n74.31\nMFCC 2\n158.25\n162.36\n40.18\n131.86\n132.94\n25.62\nMFCC 3\n-29.60\n-24.75\n31.77\n-19.80\n-16.72\n21.92\nMFCC 4\n14.66\n11.63\n23.63\n27.96\n27.38\n19.07\nMFCC 5\n-6.33\n-11.72\n23.88\n-6.31\n-5.15\n15.61\nMFCC 6\n3.40\n5.17\n15.01\n11.41\n12.48\n12.54\nMFCC 7\n-8.61\n-7.29\n12.31\n-10.37\n-11.01\n10.49\nMFCC 8\n-7.40\n-6.79\n10.82\n-4.73\n-4.59\n7.23\nMFCC 9\n-8.41\n-8.28\n11.28\n-3.48\n-4.31\n8.04\nMFCC 10\n-10.98\n-13.21\n8.74\n-7.26\n-6.84\n8.81\nMFCC 11\n-3.27\n-3.20\n7.53\n-1.21\n-1.72\n7.78\nMFCC 12\n-5.88\n-5.45\n6.95\n-3.00\n-2.94\n5.93\nMFCC 13\n-2.07\n-1.99\n4.52\n-1.25\n-0.90\n5.63\nMFCC 14\n-1.67\n-1.64\n5.27\n-2.55\n-2.88\n5.39\nMFCC 15\n-3.06\n-2.88\n4.80\n-2.16\n-1.93\n4.97\nMFCC 16\n-2.29\n-1.07\n5.59\n-0.99\n-0.62\n5.59\nMFCC 17\n-3.09\n-2.95\n4.53\n-3.55\n-3.48\n4.65\nMFCC 18\n-4.85\n-4.05\n4.91\n-1.38\n-1.81\n4.40\nMFCC 19\n-1.79\n-1.99\n4.40\n-3.72\n-3.41\n5.29\nMFCC 20\n-4.08\n-3.29\n6.23\n-4.77\n-4.22\n4.59\nCentroid of the fake data is 2897.06 whereas is much lower for the real data at 2541.34. The mean value of the first\nand second MFCCs also substantially different values given the classes. On the other hand, several feature sets exhibit\nsimilarity, such as MFCC 5.\nSubsequently, Table 3 then shows the results for the unpaired t-test between datasets. It can be observed that all features\nwith exception of the aforementioned 5th Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient showed statistical significance between\nthe two classes of data. Given that most features have significantly different means between the two classes, they are\npotentially valuable to distinguish and thus useful to train machine learning models.\nFigure 3 shows the correlation coefficients and relative entropy of each of the extracted features when used for binary\nclassification of real or AI-generated vocals. The highest correlation between the attributes and class value was observed\nto be the 2nd MFCC, with a coefficient of 0.36. This was closely followed by the 18th at a value of 0.35. The least\ncorrelation between attribute and class value were the 20th, 17th, and 5th MFCCs, which had correlation coefficients of\n0.06, 0.05, and 0.0005, respectively. The highest relative entropy feature was the 2nd MFCC with a value of 0.23, which\nwas followed by the 5th at 0.172.

Towards the lowest end of the values came the 15th and 17th MFCCs, which had respective\nvalues of 0.014 and 0.005. It is interesting to note that the lowest correlation coefficient feature was also that which had\nno statistical significance between the two classes of data, however, was noted to have relatively high information gain.\nFurthermore, Table 4 shows observed metrics when making a prediction by splitting values based on the feature with\nthe most correlation, the 2nd Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient, which had a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of 0.36.\nThe analysis shows that by splitting the data on this one attribute, a mean accuracy of 69.84% can be achieved.\n7\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nTable 3: Results of the unpaired t-test for each attribute between the real and fake classes of data.\nAttribute\nT-Statistic\nP-Value\nSignificance?\nChromagram\n-17.488\n1.25E-67\nY\nRoot Mean\nSquare\n7.799\n6.78E-15\nY\nSpectral\nCentroid\n-18.351\n3.52E-74\nY\nSpectral\nBandwidth\n-21.078\n7.70E-97\nY\nRolloff\n-14.848\n2.02E-49\nY\nZero\nCrossing Rate\n-17.173\n2.65E-65\nY\nMFCC 1\n8.087\n6.69E-16\nY\nMFCC 2\n42.5\n0.00E+00\nY\nMFCC 3\n-19.467\n4.24E-83\nY\nMFCC 4\n-33.626\n8.95E-237\nY\nMFCC 5\n-0.05\n9.61E-01\nN\nMFCC 6\n-31.418\n3.89E-208\nY\nMFCC 7\n8.349\n7.65E-17\nY\nMFCC 8\n-15.774\n1.74E-55\nY\nMFCC 9\n-27.323\n2.01E-159\nY\nMFCC 10\n-23.012\n1.17E-114\nY\nMFCC 11\n-14.627\n4.98E-48\nY\nMFCC 12\n-24.232\n1.25E-126\nY\nMFCC 13\n-8.665\n5.08E-18\nY\nMFCC 14\n8.989\n2.88E-19\nY\nMFCC 15\n-9.949\n3.14E-23\nY\nMFCC 16\n-12.613\n3.08E-36\nY\nMFCC 17\n5.345\n9.22E-08\nY\nMFCC 18\n-40.388\n0.00E+00\nY\nMFCC 19\n21.553\n4.37E-101\nY\nMFCC 20\n6.894\n5.69E-12\nY\nTable 4: Metrics when using a single rule-based classifier to split predictions via the 2nd Mel Frequency Cepstral\nCoefficient.

Interestingly, the highest performing model was the smallest cluster of\n1 nearest neighbour, which scored 81.48% accuracy, 0.827 recall, 0.817 F-Score, an MCC of 0.63, and an area under\nthe ROC Curve of 0.815. However, the highest precision value was 0.886 when using two nearest neighbours as the\npredictors. As can be observed in Figure 5, this model took, on average, 0.143 milliseconds to classify 1-second of\naudio data as real or fake.\nUnlike the KNN, the Random Forest results were moreso relative to one another given a number of trees in the forest.\nFigure 6 shows the classification results for each ensemble size. As can be observed, the model containing 310 trees\nscored an average 98.89% accuracy over the 10-folds of data. Similarly, the recall, precision, F-Score, MCC, and ROC\narea were 0.995, 0.983, 0.989, and 0.989, respectively. Figure 7 shows the inference time given an ensemble size. As\ncould be expected, inference time increases relatively linearly given the ensemble size, which is shown in Figure 7. The\naforementioned ensemble of 310 random trees took an average of 0.057 milliseconds to classify 1-second of audio data.\n8\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nFeature\nRelative Entropy\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nMFCC 2\nMFCC 18\nMFCC 4\nMFCC 6\nMFCC 9\nMFCC 12\nMFCC 10\nMFCC 19\nSpectral \nMFCC 3\nSpectral Centroid\nChromagram\nZero Crossing \nMFCC 8\nRolloff\nMFCC 11\nMFCC 16\nMFCC 15\nMFCC 14\nMFCC 13\nMFCC 7\nMFCC 1\nRoot Mean Square\nMFCC 20\nMFCC 17\nMFCC 5\nRelative Entropy\nPearson's Correlation Coefficient\nFigure 3: Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient and Relative entropy for all of the extracted features when used for binary\nclassification of real or AI-generated vocals (sorted by Pearson\u2019s).\nCluster Size\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1\nMCC\nFigure 4: Results for the KNN model when searching for the most optimal cluster.\nFigure 8 shows the affect of the number of boosting rounds for the XGBoost model when classifying the data. A\ndramatic increase of around 3% accuracy gain can be observed between 10 to 50 boosting rounds, before the results\nbecome relatively stagnant. The overall best-performing approach was when following 330 rounds of boosting, which\nled to a classification accuracy of 99.3%. The precision of this model was 0.995, the recall was 0.991, with an F-Score\nof 0.993. The MCC was observed at 0.986 with an area under the ROC curve of 0.993. Figure 9 shows the inference\nresults, which, within a range of 0.001 milliseconds, were the same. The XGBoost model following 330 rounds took an\naverage of 0.004 milliseconds to predict the class belonging to 1-second of audio data.\n4.3\nResults Comparison\nThis section compares all of the results for the models trained in this study. As described previously, 10-fold cross\nvalidation is used and the average metrics along with variance are reported.\nTable 5 shows the overall comparison of results for each of the machine learning models. As can be observed, the\nbest-performing model was the Extreme Gradient Boosting model, which scored an average 99.3% accuracy over the\n10-folds of data. However, the third-best performing model, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, may have scored 94.8%\n9\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nCluster Size\nInference Time (ms)\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nFigure 5: Observed average inference time for the KNN models to classify 1-second of audio data.\nRandom Trees in Forest\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n0.99\n1.00\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1\nMCC\nROC AUC\nFigure 6: Results for the Random Forest model when searching for the most optimal ensemble size.\nRandom Trees in Forest\nInference Time (ms)\n0.000\n0.025\n0.050\n0.075\n0.100\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nFigure 7: Observed average inference time for the Random Forest models to classify 1-second of audio data.\n10\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nBoosting Rounds\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n0.99\n1.00\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1\nMCC\nROC AUC\nFigure 8: Results for the XGBoost model when searching for the most optimal number of boosting rounds.\nBoosting Rounds\nInference Time (ms)\n0.002\n0.003\n0.004\n0.005\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nFigure 9: Observed average inference time for the XGBoost models to classify 1-second of audio data.\naccuracy, but could classify audio data in half the time at 0.002 milliseconds per object. The performance of extreme\ngradient boosting and random forests compared to the other models suggests that an ensemble approach is most useful\nfor this classification problem.\nThe variance of the metrics over the 10 folds of data can be found in Table 6. The two best performing models, XGBoost\nand Random Forest, also have a low standard deviation. These low values suggest that the models are performing well\nconsistently across the different folds of data during cross-validation. It is worth noting that the QDA approach, while\nperforming slightly worse, is more interpretable and could provide increased explainability along with lower inference\ntime.\n5\nConclusion and Future Work\nThis study has addressed some of the growing security implications with generative AI, specifically, those surrounding\nspoofing with AI-generated human speech. Given the rapidly increasing quality of these systems, it is important that\nsystems should provide transparency in real-time as to the legitimacy of a human voice within a conference or phonecall.\nAI-generated speech could be used for nefarious purposes, such as impersonation within social engineering attacks. The\ncontributions of this work are comprised of an original audio classification dataset which is released for future work,\ncomprehensive analysis of the statistical significance of audio features extracted from real and AI-generated speech,\nand finally the optimisation of machine learning models which can predict the legitimacy of speech in real-time.\n11\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nTable 5: Comparison of averaged validation metrics over 10-fold cross validation for the machine learning models.\nInference time denotes the average time taken for the model to predict the class of 1-second of audible speech.\nModel\nMean Value over 10-fold Cross Validation\nAcc.\nPrec.\nRec.\nF1\nMCC\nROC AUC\nInference\nTime (ms)\nXGBoost (330)\n0.993\n0.995\n0.991\n0.993\n0.986\n0.993\n0.004\nRandom Forest (310)\n0.989\n0.995\n0.983\n0.989\n0.978\n0.989\n0.057\nQuadratic\nDiscriminant\nAnalysis\n0.948\n0.969\n0.924\n0.946\n0.896\n0.948\n0.002\nLinear\nDiscriminant\nAnalysis\n0.889\n0.886\n0.893\n0.889\n0.778\n0.889\n0.001\nRidge\n0.883\n0.884\n0.882\n0.883\n0.767\n0.883\n0.001\nNa\u00efve Bayes\n(Gaussian)\n0.830\n0.864\n0.784\n0.822\n0.664\n0.830\n0.001\nKNN (1)\n0.815\n0.808\n0.827\n0.817\n0.630\n0.815\n0.143\nSVM\n0.723\n0.815\n0.576\n0.675\n0.465\n0.723\n0.605\nNa\u00efve Bayes\n(Bernoulli)\n0.692\n0.742\n0.587\n0.655\n0.391\n0.691\n0.001\nStochastic\nGradient Descent\n0.668\n0.732\n0.760\n0.681\n0.407\n0.673\n0.001\nGaussian Process\n0.614\n0.997\n0.229\n0.372\n0.358\n0.614\n0.561\nTable 6: Comparison of standard deviation within the classification metrics over 10-fold cross validation for the machine\nlearning models.\nModel\nMean Value over 10-fold Cross Validation\nAcc.\nPrec.\nRec.\nF1\nMCC\nROC AUC\nXGBoost (330)\n0.002\n0.002\n0.005\n0.002\n0.005\n0.002\nRandom Forest (310)\n0.003\n0.003\n0.005\n0.003\n0.006\n0.003\nQuadratic\nDiscriminant\nAnalysis\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.005\n0.009\n0.005\nLinear\nDiscriminant\nAnalysis\n0.009\n0.013\n0.009\n0.009\n0.018\n0.009\nRidge\n0.008\n0.011\n0.008\n0.008\n0.016\n0.008\nNa\u00efve Bayes\n(Gaussian)\n0.007\n0.013\n0.014\n0.011\n0.015\n0.008\nKNN (1)\n0.009\n0.017\n0.011\n0.011\n0.019\n0.009\nSVM\n0.012\n0.022\n0.019\n0.018\n0.026\n0.013\nNa\u00efve Bayes\n(Bernoulli)\n0.012\n0.014\n0.021\n0.018\n0.023\n0.012\nStochastic\nGradient Descent\n0.086\n0.178\n0.287\n0.139\n0.146\n0.086\nGaussian Process\n0.008\n0.004\n0.013\n0.017\n0.010\n0.006\nTo conclude, the remarkable ability of XGBoost and Random Forest models to generalise over folded cross-validation\nshow that it is indeed possible to detect AI-generated speech even with the most state-of-the-art models at the time\nof writing. Further validation metrics show model robustness, and they were observed to infer data in 0.004 to 0.057\nmilliseconds, effectively making them real-time classifiers. Current state-of-the-art approaches, such as those discussed\nin the literature review, are far more computationally expensive and thus may not be able to classify speech in real-time.\nThat is, our approach can detect attacks while they are occurring.\nIn future, further improvements to the approach could be made by exploring ensembles of the best performing models.\nThis could enable better generalisation through recognition and correction of model mistakes. The approaches explored\nmay also be improved with additional audio feature representations, increasing the input dimensions and providing\nmore opportunities for rule generation. Finally, the DEEP-VOICE dataset could be expanded with more speakers in\n12\nBird & Lotfi: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech\nthe future to further diversify the data and increase generalisation, as well as with the use of different neural speech\ngeneration approaches in addition to RVC.\nTo finally conclude, this study has proposed a robust machine learning approach to the detection of RVC-based voice\nconversion, enabling the recognition of voice-based social engineering attacks in real-time. The DEEP-VOICE dataset\ngenerated for this study is released to the public to promote interdisciplinary research in AI-generated speech analysis.\nAs the field continues to advance at a rapid pace, proactive approaches are necessary to ensure transparency and foster\nethical use of generative AI.\n6\nData Availability Statement\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the DEEP-VOICE repository,\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/deep-voice-deepfake-voice-recognition.\nReferences\n[1] F.

Two deepfake audio detection\nmodels based on Resnet and LCNN architectures are imple-\nmented using the ASVspoof 2019 dataset, achieving benchmark\nperformances compared to ASVspoof 2019 challenge base-\nlines. The study proposes strategies and frameworks for en-\nhancing these models, paving the way for real-time deepfake\naudio detection in communication platforms. This work con-\ntributes to the advancement of audio stream security, ensuring\nrobust detection capabilities in dynamic, real-time communica-\ntion scenarios.\nIndex Terms: Deepfake audio detection, Communication plat-\nforms, Deep learning.\n1. Introduction\nDeepfake audio detection constitutes a crucial task, wherein\nthe objective is to discern authentic (real/bonafide) audio sam-\nples from counterfeit (fake/spoof) ones through machine learn-\ning methodologies [1, 2]. Given the progress in text-to-speech\n(TTS) [3] and voice cloning (VC) [4] technologies, particularly\nin the context of voice-centric applications, it becomes essen-\ntial to address the potential threats posed by audio deepfake at-\ntacks. This necessitates the implementation of effective coun-\ntermeasures to ensure the security of services in such applica-\ntions. The predominant focus of studies in deepfake audio de-\ntection has revolved around the realm of automatic speaker ver-\nification (ASV) systems [5]. Notably, the ASVspoof challenge\n[5, 6, 7, 8] has served as a catalyst for numerous advanced re-\nsearch endeavors in this domain.\nDespite the promising strides in recent developments per-\ntaining to deepfake audio detection and countermeasure strate-\ngies, it is noteworthy that a significant portion of these solu-\ntions has been conceived and assessed within the confines of\nstatic audio recordings. Here, the term static audio recordings\nrefers to datasets comprising audio samples lasting between\n2-10 seconds, characterized by limited variations in acoustic\nbackgrounds, the number of speakers, encountered artifacts and\nrecording conditions [9, 10]. In this work, we denote static\ndeepfake audio models to represent models trained using static\naudio recordings.\nIt is important to acknowledge that these\nstatic deepfake audio models may not consistently exhibit ro-\nbust performance when deployed in real-time scenarios, such as\ncontinuous audio streams coming from applications on a source\ncomputer device or similar scenarios in communication plat-\nforms. Consider, for instance, a Teams group call within an\norganization, which represents the latter case. The observed de-\ncline in the performance of static deepfake models during such\nevents can primarily be attributed to their lack of awareness re-\ngarding dynamic variations inherent in real-time conversational\nspeech data within communication platforms.\nIn this paper, the viability of employing static deepfake au-\ndio detection models in real-time and continuous conversational\nspeech scenarios across a communication platform is system-\natically assessed. Two benchmark models are initially devel-\noped, leveraging Resnet and LCNN architectures as per [11]\nand [12] respectively. Moreover, we developed an executable\nsoftware application compatible with diverse operating system\nenvironments, streamlining the deployment of our deepfake au-\ndio detection systems. For real-time testing of our models in\na communication platform, a new dataset was curated using\nactual Teams meeting sessions. To enhance the resilience of\nthese models for real-time audio streams within a communica-\ntion platform, diverse strategies are proposed as part of future\nworks. The subsequent sections describe the methodology (Sec-\ntion 2), dataset and experimental details (Section 3), the deep-\nfake audio detection models (Section 4), the software platform\n(Section 5), and the results, discussion, and future work strate-\ngies (Section 6).\n2. Methodology\nA block diagram illustrating the components of a static deep-\nfake audio detection system, a real-time deepfake audio de-\ntection system implemented on a source device, and a real-\ntime deepfake detection system within a communication plat-\nform is depicted in Figure 1. This study focuses on assessing\nand exploring the application of static deepfake audio detection\nmodels within a real-time audio communication platform. The\nmethodology employed in this study is summarized as follows.\n\u2022 Two static deepfake detection models are initially imple-\nmented, utilizing Resnet [11] and LCNN [12] architec-\ntures. These models are trained on the ASVspoof 2019\nchallenge dataset [7].\n\u2022 The benchmarking of the deepfake models is conducted\nby comparing their performance against the baseline\nmodel scores from the ASVspoof 2019 challenge [7].\n\u2022 An executable software platform is developed to facil-\nitate the deployment of the deepfake audio detection\nmodel. The software is designed to be compatible with\nvarious operating systems.\n\u2022 Evaluation of the static deepfake models in real-time de-\ntection scenarios is carried out during our daily group\narXiv:2403.11778v1  [cs.SD]  18 Mar 2024\nDeepfake\nModel\nA static deepfake audio detection system\nreal/ fake\nDeepfake\nModel\nA real-time deepfake audio detection system\nreal/ fake\nDeepfake\nModel\nA real-time deepfake audio detection system\nin a communication platform\nreal/ fake\nSender\nReceiver\nFigure 1: A block diagram of various deepfake audio detection\nsystems.\nFigure 2: A block diagram showing the typical use-case of our\ndeepfake audio detection system.\nmeeting sessions on Microsoft Teams. This assessment\ninvolves the analysis of the model\u2019s performance in dif-\nferentiating between real and fake voices in audio stream\ndata over a communication platform. A block diagram\nview of the entire system is depicted in Figure 2.\nThis study aims to analyze the challenges and shortcomings\nassociated with employing a static deepfake audio model for\nreal-time deepfake audio detection on audio stream data within\na communication platform. Building upon the insights gained\nfrom this analysis, we put forth several strategies to implement\nan effective real-time deepfake audio detection model tailored\nfor deployment in a communication platform.\n3. Dataset and Experimental Details\nThe implementation of our deepfake audio detection models re-\nlies on the ASVspoof 2019 challenge dataset [7], which encom-\npasses both logical access (LA) and physical access (PA) chal-\nlenges. In the context of voice-based LA attacks, attackers seek\nto trick a system by imitating or altering an individual\u2019s voice,\naiming to gain unauthorized digital access, such as unlocking\na smartphone or accessing secure online information. These\nattacks are commonly executed through synthetic voice gener-\nation methods, including text-to-speech (TTS), voice cloning,\nand voice conversion technologies. The LA challenge is de-\nsigned to distinguish between genuine voices and synthetic\nvoices. On the other hand, voice-based PA attacks involve at-\ntackers to manipulate or deceive a voice-based biometric system\nby replaying a recorded real voice of an individual. The ob-\njective of the PA challenge is to distinguish between authentic\nvoices and replayed voices.\nThe challenge comes with distinct LA and PA datasets,\neach comprising 8 male and 12 female speakers in both train-\ning and development subsets. In the LA challenge, the train-\ning subset encompasses 2580 bonafide and 22800 spoofed ut-\nterances, while the PA challenge includes 5400 bonafide and\n48600 spoofed utterances. Evaluation sets for LA and PA con-\nsist of approximately 80000 and 135000 test utterances, respec-\ntively.\nThe initial phase involves the implementation of a Resnet\nmodel, adapted from [11], to distinguish between real and syn-\nthetic voices. This model is exclusively trained using the LA\ndataset. Similarly, an LCNN model, adapted from [12], is im-\nplemented to distinguish between real and replayed voices, uti-\nlizing only the PA dataset. Subsequently, the performance of\nthese models is assessed using the evaluation subset of the PA\nand LA datasets. The evaluation metrics employed for bench-\nmarking include the tandem detection cost function (t-DCF)\n[13] and the equal error rate (EER) [14]. Lower scores in these\nmetrics indicate better model performance.\nThe evaluation of our models focuses primarily on the\nASVspoof 2019 evaluation data. For real-time testing in a com-\nmunication platform, we use Microsoft Teams group meeting\nsessions and create a new dataset specifically for this purpose,\nknown as the Teams Meeting dataset.\nThe dataset is generated through the following procedure:\nwe develop an executable software application capable of run-\nning our deepfake audio detection models. During Teams meet-\ning sessions, our application is run on a participant\u2019s device,\nwith another participant speaking while keeping their cameras\nturned off. This arrangement ensures the collection of authentic\nvoice samples for testing the model predictions. To introduce\nsynthetic voice events, we used voice cloning and voice conver-\nsion systems. A moderator is assigned to instruct a speaker to\nconduct either a real or a fake trial, allowing us to note the ref-\nerence annotations associated with each trial. The topics for the\ntrials include reading exercises and conversational speech be-\ntween two speakers on selected topics. Each trial of a speaker\nlasts for 10 seconds, and a total of 10 individuals participate in\nthe experiment, each contributing 5 real and fake voice events\nfrom the reading exercises. The number of instances created us-\ning the conversational speech setup for real and fake scenarios\nis not equal.\nTo avoid scenarios where multiple speakers speak simul-\ntaneously (cocktail party scenario), we organized individuals\nparticipation in the experiment carefully with proper time-slot\narrangement. Throughout the 10-second voice trail, model pre-\ndictions are aggregated, and a majority voting scheme is em-\nployed to classify the event as either real or fake. This approach\nenables us to evaluate the individual accuracy of our static LA\nmodel (ResNet model) and PA model (LCNN model) for pre-\ndicting real-time audio stream data over a communication plat-\nform.\n4. Model pipeline and Training\nThe developmental and evaluation stages of our deepfake audio\ndetection systems follow a sequential pipeline, as depicted in\nFigure 3. The training and development phase initiates with\nthe construction of an acoustic model, which learns a map-\nping function between audio samples and their reference anno-\ntations. Raw audio samples undergo preprocessing in the fea-\nture extraction unit, extracting compressed and information-rich\nFeature Extraction\nReal/\nFake\nLabel Encoding\nLearning\nDeepfake\nmodel\nTraining phase\nDetection phase\nFeature Extraction\nDetection\nThresholding\nReal/\nFake\nFigure 3: Pipeline of a deepfake audio detection system.\naudio feature representations. Several audio feature represen-\ntations, such as mel-spectrogram cepstral coefficient (MFCC),\npower-spectrogram, and mel-spectrogram features, are empir-\nically experimented with for the development of our deepfake\naudio model. Ultimately, mel-spectrogram features are selected\nfor the LA model, while power-spectrogram features are chosen\nfor the PA model. The label encoding unit transforms textual\nreference annotations (real/fake) into a numeric format, utiliz-\ning binary encoding as the label encoding function. In the de-\ntection phase, a threshold value, corresponding to the minimum\nEER computed using the validation dataset, is applied to the\nprobability score from the model. This threshold aids in identi-\nfying whether a given audio sample is classified as real or fake.\nOur LA model is constructed using an adapted version of\nthe Resnet model architecture from [11], while our PA model\nemploys an adapted version of the LCNN model architecture\nas presented in [12]. Training our models involves utilizing\naudio samples of a 3-second duration.\nTo standardize input\nlengths, trimming and padding techniques are applied to long\nand short audio samples in the LA and PA datasets, resulting\nin 3-second audio samples. For the LA model, a feature repre-\nsentation of 80 log mel-bands spectrogram is employed. This\nfeature is extracted using a short-term Fourier transform (STFT)\nwith a fast Fourier transform (FFT) window of 512, a hop length\nof 160, and a sample rate of 16 kHz. On the other hand, the\nPA model uses a power-spectrogram feature representation, ex-\ntracted with the same feature settings as above, but without the\nmel-transformation.\nFor both the PA and LA models, each convolutional layer\nactivation undergoes batch normalization and is subject to reg-\nularization with dropout (probability = 0.3). The weights of\nthe convolutional layers are initialized using a Glorot uniform\ndistribution [15]. Training for each model spans 100 epochs,\nemploying a binary cross-entropy loss function, as defined in\nequation (1), and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate set at\n0.001. To mitigate overfitting, early stopping is implemented,\nwith termination set after 10 epochs based on the validation loss\nscore.\nL = \u2212\nN\nX\nn=1\n(yn log(pn) + (1 \u2212yn) log(1 \u2212pn))\n(1)\nIn Equation (1) L is the binary cross-entropy loss function,\nN is the total number of audio samples in the training dataset\nand yn and pn respectively denotes the true label and predicted\nprobability for the nth audio sample.\nMainApplication\nstart()\nrecord_audio_batch()\nrecord_audio()\ndelete_old_audio_files()\npreprocess_data()\nmakePrediction()\nanalyze_clips()\ncount_audio_files()\nC\nPySimpleGUI\nGUI library for creating user interfaces\nC\nSoundcard\nLibrary for interacting with\naudio input/ output devices\nC\nThreading\nModule for multi-threading\nsupport\nC\nSoundfile\nLibrary for reading and\nwriting sound files\nC\nLibrosa\nPython package for music\nand audio analysis\nC\nTensorFlow\nOpen-source machine\nlearning framework\nC\nNumpy\nLibrary for numerical\noperations on arrays\nC\nGUI\nLoginWindow()\nMainWindow()\nC\nExceptions\nHandle errors and\nexceptions\nC\nPlyer\nCross-platform Python\nlibrary for system\nnotifications\nC\nNotifications\nnotify()\nC\nAudio\nrecording\nAudio\nrecording\nThreading\noperations\nSystem\nnotifications\nFile\noperations\nAudio\nprocessing\nModel\nprediction\nArray\noperations\nDisplay\nupdates\nDisplay\nnotifications\nHandle\nerrors\nSystem\nnotifications\nFigure 4: Flow diagram of the software application develop-\nment process.\n5.

It uses various libraries such as PySimpleGUI, Sound-\ncard, Librosa, Plyer, and TensorFlow to perform different tasks\nwithin the application.

Threading intricacies have been employed\nto enable parallel execution, aligning with industry-best prac-\ntices for code readability and maintainability. This structure en-\nhances the clarity of the codebase and also promotes scalability\nand ease of future development. We test our system in stages\nthrough trial and error, checking each part to confirm it works\ncorrectly, including testing on different platforms.\n6. Results and Discussion\nIn this section, experimental results are presented and analyzed\nusing the ASVspoof 2019 evaluation data and our Teams Meet-\ning dataset. It is crucial to note that our models are trained\nsolely using the ASVspoof 2019 development dataset, and the\nTeams Meeting dataset is exclusively used for real-time testing\nof our models.\n6.1. ASVspoof 2019 Evaluation data\nThe deepfake audio detection performance of our LA and PA\nmodels on the ASVspoof 2019 evaluation data is summarized\nin Table 1. The baseline models, denoted as Baseline 1 and\nBaseline 2 in Table 1, correspond to the baseline models asso-\nciated with the ASVspoof 2019 challenge [7]. The results indi-\ncate that our LA model achieves an EER of 7.39, outperforming\nboth baseline models. Additionally, the LA model demonstrates\na t-DCF score of 0.215, closely aligning with the score of the\nBaseline 1 model. Similarly, our PA model exhibits an EER\nof 4.38 and a t-DCF score of 0.121, surpassing the baseline\nmodel scores. These findings underscore the effectiveness of\nour static PA and LA models in distinguishing between real and\nfake voices within the context of the ASVspoof 2019 dataset.\n6.2. Teams Meeting dataset\nTable 2 provides an overview of the performance metrics for\nthe LA and PA models when deployed in real-time audio stream\ndata during Microsoft Teams meetings. The metrics for evalua-\ntion include precision (P), recall (R), and F-score (F), calculated\nbased on the definitions provided in the equation (2), where TP,\nFP, and FN represent true positive, false positive, and false\nnegative rates, respectively. The precision values indicate the\nproportion of correctly identified positive instances among all\ninstances predicted as positive. In this context, the LA model\noutperforms the PA model with a higher precision of 0.48 com-\npared to 0.39, suggesting a better ability to correctly identify\npositive instances. Similarly looking at the recall scores, it can\nbe identified that the PA model is more prone to false negative\npredictions.\nP =\nTP\nTP + FP ,\nR =\nTP\nTP + FN ,\nF = 2PR\nP + R\n(2)\nThe results reveal that the models exhibit poor performance\nin real-time communication platform scenarios compared to\ntheir performance on the ASVspoof 2019 evaluation data. This\nunderperformance can be attributed to the static nature of the\naudio data used for training the models, which contrasts with the\ndynamic nature of real-time audio stream data. The ASVspoof\n2019 dataset\u2019s training and development subsets share similar\nspoofing algorithms and conditions for both the LA and PA\ndatasets. We assume that training on the same types of spoofing\nattacks may lead to overfitting and limited generalization on un-\nseen attack conditions. Additionally, the dataset\u2019s limited vari-\nations in terms of the number of speakers, acoustic conditions,\nand recording conditions contribute to poor generalization on\nreal-time audio stream data.\nTo address these issues and enhance the robustness of our\ndeepfake audio detection models for real-time communication\nplatforms, we propose the following strategies.\n6.3. Recommended Strategies\n6.3.1. Training Data Variability\nTo address real-time communication nuances, augment the\nASVspoof 2019 dataset with additional conversational, noisy,\nand fragmented speech data is an immediate first step. Incorpo-\nrating datasets like the Spotify podcast collection [16], FoR [17],\nWaveFake [18], LRPD [19], In-the-wild [20], and VoxCeleb2\n[21] can introduce more diverse acoustic scenarios, enhancing\nthe model\u2019s adaptability to real-world communication platform\nconditions. We plan to investigate the effects of training with\nthese datasets collectively in our future work.\n6.3.2. Data Augmentation\nDevelop novel data augmentation methods tailored to the spe-\ncific variations introduced by communication platforms. This\nmay involve simulating platform-specific artifacts, such as\nnetwork-induced delays, packet loss, or compression artifacts.\nThese techniques aim to improve the model\u2019s robustness to the\nunique challenges posed by real-time audio streams in commu-\nnication environments. In our future work, we plan to explore\na data augmentation strategy that focuses on understanding the\nimpact of data compression in the communication platform.\n6.3.3. Generative Model Approaches\nExplore the integration of generative models to synthesize ad-\nditional training samples.\nBy leveraging generative models\nlike variational autoencoder (VAE) [22] or similar approaches,\nsynthetic data can be generated, providing the model with a\nmore extensive set of examples for distinguishing between gen-\nuine and deepfake audio in real-time scenarios. In our future\nwork, we plan to design and implement a generative model-\naugmented classifier for real-time deepfake detection, inspired\nby the approach proposed in [23].\nTable 1: Evaluation performance of the LA and PA model using\nASVspoof 2019 evaluation dataset.\nModel\nLA\nPA\nEER\nt-DCF\nEER\nt-DCF\nBaseline 1\n8.09\n0.211\n13.54\n0.301\nBaseline 2\n9.57\n0.236\n11.04\n0.245\nLA\n7.39\n0.215\n-\n-\nPA\n-\n-\n4.38\n0.121\nTable 2: Evaluation performance of the LA and PA model on\nreal-time audio stream data in Teams.\nModel\nPrecision\nRecall\nF-score\nPA\n0.39\n0.41\n0.40\nLA\n0.48\n0.42\n0.45\n7. Conclusion\nThis study aimed to develop a real-time deepfake audio detec-\ntion system for communication platforms. Two static deepfake\naudio detection models were implemented using the ASVspoof\n2019 dataset. Subsequently, a software application was created\nto assess the models performance in real-time communication,\nspecifically tested in Teams meeting sessions. The investigation\nhighlighted challenges associated with deploying static deep-\nfake detection models in real-time communication platforms.\nThe study recommends future work to focus on developing an\nefficient deepfake audio detection model for real-time predic-\ntion in communication platforms.\n8.

This work introduces an open-source\nand user-friendly online platform, DeepFake-O-Meter v2.0, that\nintegrates state-of-the-art methods for detecting DeepFake images,\nvideos, and audio. Built upon DeepFake-O-Meter v1.0, we have\nsignificantly upgraded and improved the platform architecture\ndesign, including user interaction, detector integration, job\nbalancing, and security management. The platform aims to offer\neveryday users a convenient service for analyzing DeepFake media\nusing multiple state-of-the-art detection algorithms. It ensures\nsecure and private delivery of the analysis results. Furthermore,\nit serves as an evaluation and benchmanrking platform for\nresearchers in digital media forensics to compare the performance\nof multiple algorithms on the same input. We have also conducted a\ndetailed usage analysis based on the collected data to gain deeper\ninsights into our platform\u2019s statistics. This involves analyzing\nfour-month trends in user activity and evaluating the processing\nefficiency of each detector.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nGenerative AI models are creating highly realistic synthetic\nimages [1], [2], [3], videos [4], [5], [6], and audio [7], [8],\n[9], [10], with both improved quality and faster processing\ntime. The rise of generative media poses a significant threat\nof impersonation and disinformation, commonly known as\nDeepFakes. They erode the public trust in domains such as\nsocial media, politics, military, geospatial intelligence, and\ncyber-security.\nCorrespondingly, a variety of detection methods have been\ndeveloped to expose the generated image, video, and audio [11],\n[12], [13], [14]. Current DeepFake detection methods typically\nrely on deep neural networks to automatically learn and extract\ndistinctive features from the media. These features are then\nfed into a binary classifier to determine whether the media is\nreal or fake. To detect generated images and deepfake videos,\nexisting methods can be categorized based on their approach\nto extracting features, which include spatial pattern based [15],\n[16], [17], [18], [19], frequency analysis [20], [21], [22], [23],\nand spatial-temporal inconsistencies [24], [25], [26], [27]. In\nfake audio detection, extensive research has focused on speech\nsynthesis and replay attack detection [28], [29]. A variety of\ndiscriminative representations have been explored, including bi-\nspectral patterns [30], Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients\n\u2020Corresponding Author (shanjia@buffalo.edu)\n(LFCC) [31], RawNet2 features [32], vocoder artifacts [33],\nand Whisper features [34].\nBeyond open-source detection methods, several online plat-\nforms and plugin modules have been developed to provide user-\nfriendly tools to analyze digital media. These services make\nDeepFake detection accessible to everyone without requiring\ncoding or research expertise. Most of them are commercial\ntools with self-designed and closed-source detectors, such\nas Deepware [35], WeVerify [36], AI Voice Detector [37],\nDuckDuckGoose [38], Sensity [39], Resemble.AI [40]. Dif-\nferently, our DeepFake-O-Meter v2.0 platform provides non-\nprofit services and integrates multiple state-of-the-art detectors\ncovering DeepFake image, video, and audio detection. A\ndetailed comparison of our platform with existing tools is\nsummarized in Table I.\nOur work expands upon the initial version of DeepFake-\nO-Meter v1.0 presented in [41]. This new version introduces\nthe following three key improvements. First, instead of only\ntargeting deepfake video detection, the DeepFake-O-Meter\nv2.0 adds multiple algorithms for DeepFake image and audio\ndetection. Second, we re-design both the front and back end to\nprovide more user-friendly and computation-efficient functions.\nThird, we emphasize the scalability of the platform by adding\nuser feedback, usage analysis, and third-party docker creation\nand submission.\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We design a new front-end architecture with user-friendly\nfunctions, including file upload supporting three media\nmodalities, detector selection with 18 detectors, user\ninformation input, and authorized data collection.\n\u2022 In the back-end design, we expand the detectors in\nDeepFake-O-Meter v1.0 [41] to cover AI-generated image\nand audio detection with more advanced detection models.\nWe also incorporate a job balancing module to help address\nconflicts between multiple users and tasks.\n\u2022 We conduct comprehensive statistical analysis to gain deep\ninsights into the usage of our platform, including four-\nmonth user activity trends, detector processing efficiency,\nand query popularity.\nII. PLATFORM DESIGN\nIn this section, we describe the architecture design of the\nDeepFake-O-Meter v2.0 platform, which includes the front-end\narXiv:2404.13146v2  [cs.CR]  27 Jun 2024\nTABLE I: Summary of existing platforms for DeepFake detection. \u201c-\u201d indicates no detectors, and \u201cN/A\u201d indicates unknown\ninformation.\nPlatform\nUsage\n# Detector\nWebsite\nOpen?\nFree?\nImage\nVideo\nAudio\nDeepware\n\u2713\n\u2713\n-\n4\n-\nhttps://scanner.deepware.ai/\nWeVerify\n\u2713\n\u2713\nN/A\nN/A\n-\nhttps://weverify.eu/verification-plugin/\nAI or Not\n\u2717\n\u2717\nN/A\n-\nN/A\nhttps://www.aiornot.com/\nContent at Scale\n\u2717\n\u2713\nN/A\n-\n-\nhttps://contentatscale.ai/ai-image-detector/\nAI Voice Detector\n\u2717\n\u2717\n-\n-\nN/A\nhttps://aivoicedetector.com/\nDuckDuckGoose\n\u2717\n\u2717\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nhttps://duckduckgoose.ai/\nSensity\n\u2717\n\u2717\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nhttps://sensity.ai/deepfake-detection/\nResemble.AI\n\u2717\n\u2713\n-\n-\nN/A\nhttps://resemble.ai/free-deepfake-detector/\nTrueMedia\n\u2713\n\u2713\u2021\n8\n5\n3\nhttps://truemedia.org/\nFakeCatcher (Intel)\n\u2717\n\u2717\n-\nN/A\n-\nFakeCatcher\nVideo Authenticator (Microsoft)\n\u2717\n\u2717\nN/A\nN/A\n-\nVideoAuthenticator\nPindrop Pulse\n\u2717\n\u2717\n-\n-\nN/A\nhttps://www.pindrop.com/deepfake/\nSentinel\n\u2717\n\u2717\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nhttps://thesentinel.ai/\nDeepFake-o-meter v1.0 (Ours)\n\u2713\n\u2713\n2\n9\n-\n-\nDeepFake-o-meter v2.0 (Ours)\n\u2713\n\u2713\n6\n6\n5\nhttp://zinc.cse.buffalo.edu/ubmdfl/deep-o-meter/home login\ndevelopment of the user interface and back-end design with\nserver-side components for data storage, detection processing,\nand application functionality.\nA. Front-end Design\nTo interact with users, we built a website as the front end of\nthe DeepFake-O-Meter v2.0 platform, allowing users to submit\ndetection tasks, check the results, and manage user data. Our\nfront end is built on a variety of technologies. The core of our\nsystem uses the Python Flask framework for logic processing\nand the Apache server for hosting and managing web services.\nThe design and layout of the web pages are crafted using\nHTML and CSS. At the same time, AJAX technology enables\nasynchronous page updates, allowing for real-time updates for\ndetection results without the need to reload the entire page.\nUser information is stored in a SQLite database and includes\nencryption algorithms.\nIn this section, we will describe the whole process and\nprovide details on the implementation of user interaction.\n1) Account System: We have developed an account system\nto safeguard user data and ensure secure usage of our platform.\nUsers must log in before they can submit tasks. First-time users\ncan see the login button on the homepage, click to enter the\nlogin page, and click Signup to register an account. Users need\nto fill in their username, email address, and password and verify\nthe authenticity of their email address with the verification\ncode sent by our system to complete the registration and log\nin for the first time.\n2) Task Submission: The homepage serves as the sole\ninterface for users to submit tasks, which comprises three\nelements: a media file, detector selection, and supplementary\ninformation, as shown in Fig. 1 (a).\nFile Upload. To select a file to upload, users can either click\non the file upload area and select a local file or drag and\ndrop a file into this area. Users can change the file anytime\n\u2021Access requires a user application.\nTABLE II: Supported file type for task submission.\nMedia Modality\nSupported File Type\nVideo\nmp4, bmp, tif, nef, raf, avi, mov\nImage\njpg, png, jpeg\nAudio\nflac, wav, mp3\nby clicking or dragging it in again before submission. The\nformat of the video, image, and audio that can be uploaded\nare shown in Table. II. Moreover, we have set up a tiered user\nsystem for efficient resource allocation and enhanced server\nsecurity, which includes regular, advanced, and super users,\neach with specific daily task submission limits. Super users,\nusually administrators, can submit tasks without any restrictions.\nAdvanced users can submit up to 300 daily tasks, while regular\nusers are limited to 30.\nDetector Selection. Once a file is uploaded, the system will\nautomatically present the available detection methods in the\n\u201cDetector Selection\u201d module based on the file type. Users can\nchoose one or multiple submission methods. Additionally, they\ncan click the icon next to the method name to access the\ndetector references and publicly available codes for a deep\nunderstanding.\nSupplementary Information. Before finalizing the submission,\nwe have designed the supplementary information module for\nusers to provide additional information on the sample, such\nas data source, ground truth, and background information.\nAdditionally, users can choose whether they want to share\ntheir data for academic research purposes only. This module\nis designed to support the ongoing advancement of the\nDeepFake-O-Meter v2.0 platform. Gathering user-granted data\nand background information about uploaded samples is crucial\nfor this purpose. It serves as an effective method for collecting\ndiverse DeepFake data, which can be utilized to enhance the\ndetection methods on our platform in the future.\n3) Result Display: After submitting the task, users are\ndirected to the result page. Each selected detector displays\na progress bar with an estimated average processing time\nFig. 1: DeepFake-O-Meter web pages, (a) Homepage, (b) Result Page, (c) Detailed Result Page, (d) Submission History Page.\nwhile running on the back end. The front end actively tracks\nthe processing progress in real time and promptly shows the\nresults on the webpage. Each detector will output a likelihood\nprobability of the uploaded sample, as depicted in Fig. 1\n(b). The likelihood score derived from the method indicates\nthe probability of the input being fake. This score reflects\nthe extent to which the input shares characteristics with the\nreal or fake data labeled in the training set of the method,\nas reported in the original study, supported by correlation\nstatistics. However, it is important to note that this score\nshould not be considered as providing a deterministic result.\nAdditionally, we provide result links under the \u201cCompleted\u201d\ntab for users to access a comprehensive detection report, which\nincludes detailed prediction scores, method descriptions, paper\nreferences, source codes, and advanced results (if available,\nsuch as intermediate results and frame-level analysis for video\ndetectors). One example is shown in Fig. 1 (c).\n4) Submission History: The submission history page, acces-\nsible through \u201cMy Submission\u201d in the menu bar upon login,\ndisplays users\u2019 past submissions (refer to Fig. 1 (d)). It features\na four-column table showcasing each task\u2019s submission time,\nsample preview, result link, and processing status.\nB. Back-end Design\nOur back-end is a computation server with eight A5000\nGPUs, which is mainly used for performing DeepFake detection\nmethods. This section will provide an overview of the backend\ndesign, container building, and job balancing module.\n1) Overview: Once the user submits a file with selected\ndetectors from the front end, the back end calls correspond-\ning detection methods for the uploaded file. Since different\ndetection methods rely on diverse environment settings and are\ntailored to different data formats, preprocessing steps, and result\nanalyses, we have developed a unified framework to seamlessly\nintegrate the state-of-the-art DeepFake detection algorithms.\nSpecifically, our framework has two major designs: container\ncreation and job balancing. The following steps introduce the\nlogic of our back-end pipeline.\n(1) Check if any new task is submitted by monitoring the\nback-end task folder.\n(2) Parse the submitted task and extract the required informa-\ntion, such as username, file path, and submission time, for\nthe next job balancing.\n(3) Sort jobs with a pre-defined priority, inversely proportional\nto the query frequency. This approach ensures fair distribu-\ntion among users rather than favoring those with the highest\nquery frequency. Jobs are then queued according to their\npriority.\n(4) Constantly check if there are jobs in the queue and the\nGPU resources are available. If so, pop out the job and the\nGPU index.\n(5) Parse the corresponding detection method the user uploaded\nand run the corresponding docker container.\n(6) After detection, results will be shared back to the front end.\n2) Container Building: Virtual machines [41] were the\ninitial solution to resolve environmental conflicts on a sin-\ngle machine. However, they are resource-intensive, involve\nredundant operations, and have slow startup times. Differently,\ncontainers [41] can isolate the process without simulating an\nentire operating system. Docker, the most popular container\nsolution, allows developers to package applications and their de-\npendencies into portable containers that can run on any machine.\nTo facilitate the independent execution of each method, we\ncreate a separate Docker image for each detection method. Our\nplatform integrates the following DeepFake detector, including\n6 image detection methods, 7 video detection methods, and\n5 audio detection methods. Each detection docker receives\nan image, video, or audio file as input and outputs detection\nprobabilities and advanced results (if available). These results\nare then sent to the front-end for users to review. The summary\nof each detection method is given in Table III.\n\u2022 Nodown [20]: This work introduces DeepFake image detec-\ntors without performing down-sampling in the first layer on\nResNet50, XceptionNet, and Efficient-B4 backbones.\n\u2022 GLFF [42]: This work introduces a two-branch model\nto improve the generalization ability of DeepFake image\ndetection. It combines global spatial information from the\nwhole image and local informative features from multiple\npatches selected by a novel patch selection module.\n\u2022 HIFI [43]: The method contains three components: multi-\nbranch feature extractor, localization, and classification\nmodules. Each branch of the feature extractor learns to\nclassify forgery attributes at one level, while localization and\nclassification modules segment the pixel-level forgery region\nand detect image-level forgery, respectively.\n\u2022 DMImageDetection [22]: This work averages the outputs of\nseveral GAN image detectors trained on GAN and Diffusion\nimages. To improve the accuracy, a calibration procedure\nusing just two real images and two synthetic ones for each\nmodel is used.\n\u2022 CLIP-ViT [19]: This work proposes to perform real-vs-fake\nimage classification without learning, i.e., using a feature\nspace not explicitly trained to distinguish real from fake\nimages. Based on the feature space of a large pre-trained\nvision-language model (CLIP-ViT), nearest neighbor and\nlinear probing are used for classification. It achieves good\ngeneralization ability in detecting fake images from various\ngenerative models.\n\u2022 NPR [44]: This work finds that the local interdependence\namong image pixels caused by up-sampling operators is\nsignificantly demonstrated in synthetic images generated by\nGAN or diffusion. Based on this, they present Neighboring\nPixel Relationships (NPR) to achieve generalized deepfake\ndetection.\n\u2022 DSP-FWA [45]: This work is designed to detect face-\nswap DeepFake videos. It is based on the observations that\ncommonly-used transform leave certain distinctive artifacts\nin the resulting DeepFake Videos, which a dedicated deep\nneural network model can capture.\n\u2022 WAV2Lip-STA [47]: This work proposes a model attribution\nmethod by fusing spatial (frame-level) and temporal (video-\nlevel) attention schemes for discriminative feature extraction.\nResNet-50 is used as the CNN feature extractor. It is fine-\ntuned on lip-syncing DeepFake videos.\n\u2022 FTCN [46]: This method proposes a fully temporal convolu-\ntion network (FTCN) to reduce the spatial convolution kernel\nsize to one while maintaining the temporal convolution kernel\nsize unchanged. It also designs a temporal transformer net-\nwork to explore long-term temporal coherence for DeepFake\nvideo detection.\n\u2022 SBI [48]: This work presents novel self-blended images\n(SBIs) as training data to train face-swap DeepFake detectors.\nThe idea is that more general and hardly recognizable fake\nsamples encourage classifiers to learn generic and robust\nrepresentations without overfitting to manipulation-specific\nartifacts. It adopts the EfficientNet-b4 network pre-trained\non ImageNet as the classifier.\n\u2022 AltFreezing [49]: This work uses 3D ResNet50 as backbone\nfor more general face forgery detection. It trains the model\nwith the proposed AltFreezing strategy that separates the\nspatial and temporal weights into two groups and alternately\nfreezes one group of weights to encourage the model to\ncapture both the spatial and temporal artifacts.\n\u2022 LSDA [51]: This work designs a simple yet effective detector\ncalled Latent Space Data Augmentation (LSDA), based\non the idea that representations with a wider variety of\nforgeries should be able to learn a more generalizable\ndecision boundary, thereby mitigating the overfitting of\nmethod-specific features. The method enlarges the forgery\nspace by constructing and simulating variations within and\nacross forgery features in the latent space for generalizable\nDeepFake video detection.\n\u2022 LIPINC [50]: This detector targets lip-syncing DeepFake\ndetection by identifying temporal inconsistencies in the\nTABLE III: Details of integrated open-source DeepFake detection methods.\nMethods\nYear\nOrganization\nDetection Scope\nRepositories\nNodown [20]\n2021\nUniversity Federico II of Naples\nImage\n(trained on StyleGAN2)\nhttps://github.com/grip-unina/GANimageDetection\nGLFF [42]\n2023\nUniversity at Buffalo\nImage\n(trained on ProGAN and\nDALL-E images)\nhttps://github.com/littlejuyan/FusingGlobalandLocal\nHIFI [43]\n2023\nMichigan State University\nImage\n(trained on GAN and diffusion)\nhttps://github.com/CHELSEA234/HiFi IFDL\nDMimage-\nDetection\n[22]\n2023\nUniversity Federico II of Naples\nImage\n(trained on ProGAN and LDM)\nhttps://github.com/grip-unina/DMimageDetection\nCLIP-ViT [19]\n2023\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\nImage\n(trained on ProGAN)\nhttps://github.com/Yuheng-Li/UniversalFakeDetect\nNPR [44]\n2024\nBeijing Jiaotong University\nImage\n(trained on ProGAN)\nhttps://github.com/chuangchuangtan/NPR-DeepfakeDetection\nDSP-FWA [45]\n2019\nUniversity at Albany\nFace-swap deepfake\nimage and video\nhttps://github.com/yuezunli/DSP-FWA\nFTCN [46]\n2021\nXiamen University\nFace-swap deepfake video\nhttps://github.com/yinglinzheng/FTCN\nWav2lip-STA [47]\n2022\nUniversity at Buffalo\nLip-syncing deepfake video\nhttps://github.com/shanface33/Deepfake Model Attribution\nSBI [48]\n2022\nThe University of Tokyo\nFace-swap deepfake video\nhttps://github.com/mapooon/SelfBlendedImages\nAltFreezing [49]\n2023\nUniversity of Science\nand Technology of China\nFace-swap deepfake video\nhttps://github.com/ZhendongWang6/AltFreezing\nLIPINC [50]\n2024\nUniversity at Buffalo\nLip-syncing deepfake video\nhttps://github.com/skrantidatta/LIPINC\nLSDA [51]\n2024\nThe Chinese University of\nHong Kong\nFace-swap deepfake video\nhttps://github.com/SCLBD/DeepfakeBench/tree/main\nRawNet2 [52]\n2021\nEurecom\nAudio\n(trained on ASVspoof 2019 LA)\nhttps://github.com/eurecom-asp/rawnet2-antispoofing\nLFCC-LCNN [53]\n2021\nNational Institute of Informatics\nAudio\n(trained on ASVspoof 2021 DF)\nhttps://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/project-NN-Pytorch-scripts/tree/master/project\nRawNet3 [54]\n2022\nNaver Corporation\nAudio\n(trained on ASVspoof 2021 DF)\nhttps://github.com/Jungjee/RawNet\nRawNet2-\nVocoder\n[33]\n2023\nUniversity at Buffalo\nAudio\n(trained on LibriSeVoc)\nhttps://github.com/csun22/Synthetic-Voice-Detection-Vocoder-Artifacts\nWhisper [34]\n2023\nWroc\u0142aw University of\nScience and Technology\nAudio\n(trained on ASVspoof 2021 DF)\nhttps://github.com/piotrkawa/deepfake-whisper-features\nmouth region. It involves a local and global mouth frame\nextractor to extract adjacent and similarly posed mouth\nframes based on mouth openness throughout the video\nsequence and a spatial-temporal inconsistency extractor for\nencoding and learning distinctive inconsistency features.\n\u2022 RawNet2\n[52]: This method applies the RawNet2 archi-\ntecture to audio anti-spoofing tasks.

It incorporates the Res2Net backbone\nand multi-layer feature aggregation.\n\u2022 LFCC-LCNN [53]: This method integrates LFCC feature\nextraction with an LCNN (Light Convolutional Neural\nNetwork) classifier for speech deepfake detection.\n\u2022 RawNet2-Vocoder [33]: This detector proposes a multi-task\nlearning framework for identifying synthetic human voices.\nIt uses a binary-class RawNet2 model that shares the feature\nextractor with a vocoder identification module. By treating\nvocoder identification as a pretext task, the method constrains\nthe feature extractor from focusing on vocoder artifacts for\ndeepfake voice detection.\n\u2022 Whisper [34]: This work uses the Whisper encoder as a\nfeature extractor in deepfake audio detection and performs\nwell when combined with the existing detection architectures.\n3) Job Balancing: We design a monitoring thread that parses\nusername, file location, uploading time information when a\nnew task is submitted. Details of the job balancing module is\nFig. 2: Pipeline of the job balancing module.\ndescribed in Fig. 2.\nIII. PLATFORM DATA ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we dive into usage statistics to reveal insights\nabout our platform. Based on our dataset spanning 115 days\nof user activity, we first analyze usage trends and then conduct\nan in-depth detailed analysis of each detector\u2019s processing\nefficiency and query popularity.\nA. Usage Analysis\nIn this section, we show the platform\u2019s usage activities\ncollected from February 8, 2024, to June 1, 2024. The platform\ncurrently has 632 registered users, among which 445 users\nsubmitted 4,091 tasks during this period. In Fig. 3, we provide\nstatistical analysis of the user demographics, including the\ncountries and regions, as well as the browsing behavior, such\nas access sources and patterns in their registered email domains.\nThe accesses to the platform come from 98 countries, with\nFig. 3: User pattern statistics based on data from February 8, 2024, to June 1, 2024.\nFig. 4: Accumulative daily submission activity of our platform.\nthe largest portion from the United States (41%) and Germany\n(11%). Regarding access sources, 53% of users reached our\nplatform via Google searches, while the remaining half came\nthrough referrals from various websites, including news pages\nlike National Geographic. This suggests that the proliferation\nand media coverage of DeepFake technology have notably\nimpacted our website traffic. Furthermore, the email addresses\nof the platform users spread across 296 domains, among\nwhich 66% of users registered on our platform using Gmail\naccounts. Fig. 4 shows the accumulative submission activity\nof the platform during the data collection period. The figure\nshows that our platform has experienced significant submission\ngrowth since May 1, 2024, and there are, on average, 34 new\nsubmissions each day.\nB. Detector Analysis\nTo evaluate the efficiency of the back-end testing, we\nrecorded the running time for each detection task across\nvarious modules and presented the average running time for\neach detection module in Fig. 5. The figure reveals that the\naverage running time for image and audio detection modules\nis approximately 30 seconds. For video modules, the average\ntime extends to approximately 90 seconds, primarily due to\nthe intricate processes involved in face cropping and frame-by-\nframe prediction. Furthermore, we assess the usage popularity\nof each detector in Fig. 6. The figure shows that the use of\nimage and video detectors is significantly more widespread\nthan that of audio detectors, indicating that the appearance of\npotential fake images and fake videos are more prevailing.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we introduce the DeepFake-O-Meter v2.0,\nan open platform that integrates multiple state-of-the-art\nalgorithms for detecting DeepFake images, videos, and audio.\nOur platform aims to offer comprehensive, user-friendly, and\nFig. 5: Running time of each module\nFig. 6: Number of query of each detector.\naccessible services to a wide audience, including academic\nresearchers and the general public.\nThere are several directions for us to improve our platform\nin the future. Firstly, we will focus on continually integrating\nadvanced detectors and enhancing the interface for developers\nto submit detection algorithms conveniently. We also plan\nto explore the inclusion of multi-modal detection methods,\nsuch as audio-visual DeepFake video detectors [55], [56] and\ntext-image inconsistency detectors [57], [58]. Furthermore,\nenhancing the detection efficiency is also a crucial direction\nfor improvement. We will also conduct thorough performance\nevaluations of integrated detectors using real-world data and\noffer detailed insights to assist users in selecting the most\nsuitable detectors for their needs on our platform.\nAcknowledgement.
