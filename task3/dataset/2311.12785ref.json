        "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating interactive\nLLMs such as ChatGPT using publicly available data sets. We carry out an\nextensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 23 data sets covering 8\ndifferent common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual\nand multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly\ndesigned multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with\nzero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some\ntasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages\nthan generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual\nprompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that\nChatGPT is 63.41% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories\nunder logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning,\nhence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive\nthan inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like\nother LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric\nmemory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the\ninteractive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying\nLLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++\non machine translation, in a multi-turn \"prompt engineering\" fashion. We also\nrelease codebase for evaluation set extraction.",

This kNN index can be kept on\neither the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can\nindex practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in\nevery decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every\nkey. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization\nbenchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the\nBookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time.

The goal of AIGC is to make the\ncontent creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the\nproduction of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by\nextracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by\nhuman, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent\ninformation.

In this article, we first\nreview the AIGC techniques and their applications in wireless networks. We then\npresent the AIGC-as-a-service (AaaS) concept and discuss the challenges in\ndeploying AaaS at the edge networks. Yet, it is essential to have performance\nmetrics to evaluate the accuracy of AIGC services. Thus, we introduce several\nimage-based perceived quality evaluation metrics. Then, we propose a general\nand effective model to illustrate the relationship between computational\nresources and user-perceived quality evaluation metrics. To achieve efficient\nAaaS and maximize the quality of generated content in wireless edge networks,\nwe propose a deep reinforcement learning-enabled algorithm for optimal ASP\nselection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a\nhigher quality of generated content to users and achieve fewer crashed tasks by\ncomparing with four benchmarks, i.e., overloading-avoidance, random,\nround-robin policies, and the upper-bound schemes.",

By proposing PromptInject, a prosaic alignment\nframework for mask-based iterative adversarial prompt composition, we examine\nhow GPT-3, the most widely deployed language model in production, can be easily\nmisaligned by simple handcrafted inputs. In particular, we investigate two\ntypes of attacks -- goal hijacking and prompt leaking -- and demonstrate that\neven low-aptitude, but sufficiently ill-intentioned agents, can easily exploit\nGPT-3's stochastic nature, creating long-tail risks. The code for PromptInject\nis available at https://github.com/agencyenterprise/PromptInject.",

        "title": "Is ChatGPT a General-Purpose Natural Language Processing Task Solver?",
        "abstract": "Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated the ability to perform a variety of natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks zero-shot -- i.e., without adaptation on downstream data. Recently,\nthe debut of ChatGPT has drawn a great deal of attention from the natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) community due to the fact that it can generate\nhigh-quality responses to human input and self-correct previous mistakes based\non subsequent conversations. However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can\nserve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this\nwork, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by\nevaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task\ncategories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that\nChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g.,\narithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific\ntasks such as sequence tagging. We additionally provide in-depth analysis\nthrough qualitative case studies.",

        "abstract": "Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools, allowing\nthem to overcome physical limitations and explore new frontiers. With the\nadvent of foundation models, AI systems have the potential to be equally adept\nin tool use as humans. This paradigm, i.e., tool learning with foundation\nmodels, combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to\nachieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving.\nDespite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive\nunderstanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors in this\nfield. To this end, we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in\nthis paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its\ncognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the\ncomplementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool\nlearning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate\na general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user\ninstruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several\nsubtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively\nconquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to\ntrain models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the\ngeneralization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool\nlearning evaluation in prior works, we experiment with 18 representative tools\nand show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing\ntools. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further\ninvestigation for tool learning. In general, we hope this paper could inspire\nfuture research in integrating tools with foundation models.",

        "title": "On the Robustness of ChatGPT: An Adversarial and Out-of-distribution Perspective",
        "abstract": "ChatGPT is a recent chatbot service released by OpenAI and is receiving\nincreasing attention over the past few months. While evaluations of various\naspects of ChatGPT have been done, its robustness, i.e., the performance to\nunexpected inputs, is still unclear to the public. Robustness is of particular\nconcern in responsible AI, especially for safety-critical applications. In this\npaper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the robustness of ChatGPT from the\nadversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. To do so, we employ the\nAdvGLUE and ANLI benchmarks to assess adversarial robustness and the Flipkart\nreview and DDXPlus medical diagnosis datasets for OOD evaluation. We select\nseveral popular foundation models as baselines. Results show that ChatGPT shows\nconsistent advantages on most adversarial and OOD classification and\ntranslation tasks. However, the absolute performance is far from perfection,\nwhich suggests that adversarial and OOD robustness remains a significant threat\nto foundation models. Moreover, ChatGPT shows astounding performance in\nunderstanding dialogue-related texts and we find that it tends to provide\ninformal suggestions for medical tasks instead of definitive answers. Finally,\nwe present in-depth discussions of possible research directions.",

        "abstract": "Large \"instruction-tuned\" language models (i.e., finetuned to respond to\ninstructions) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generalize zero-shot to\nnew tasks. Nevertheless, they depend heavily on human-written instruction data\nthat is often limited in quantity, diversity, and creativity, therefore\nhindering the generality of the tuned model. We introduce Self-Instruct, a\nframework for improving the instruction-following capabilities of pretrained\nlanguage models by bootstrapping off their own generations. Our pipeline\ngenerates instructions, input, and output samples from a language model, then\nfilters invalid or similar ones before using them to finetune the original\nmodel. Applying our method to the vanilla GPT3, we demonstrate a 33% absolute\nimprovement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions, on par with\nthe performance of InstructGPT-001, which was trained with private user data\nand human annotations. For further evaluation, we curate a set of\nexpert-written instructions for novel tasks, and show through human evaluation\nthat tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public\ninstruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute gap behind\nInstructGPT-001. Self-Instruct provides an almost annotation-free method for\naligning pre-trained language models with instructions, and we release our\nlarge synthetic dataset to facilitate future studies on instruction tuning.

        "title": "Jailbroken: How Does LLM Safety Training Fail?",
        "abstract": "Large language models trained for safety and harmlessness remain susceptible\nto adversarial misuse, as evidenced by the prevalence of \"jailbreak\" attacks on\nearly releases of ChatGPT that elicit undesired behavior. Going beyond\nrecognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how they\ncan be created. We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competing\nobjectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives arise when a\nmodel's capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalization\noccurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which\ncapabilities exist. We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design and\nthen evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's\nClaude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks. We find that\nvulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-training\nefforts behind these models. Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modes\nsucceed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models'\nred-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks. Our\nanalysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity -- that safety\nmechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model -- and argues\nagainst the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes.",
