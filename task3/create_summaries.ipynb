The first paper explores the use of wider and deeper networks for fairer LLM evaluations, drawing inspiration from deep neural networks and academic paper reviewing. The second paper proposes using strong LLMs as judges for evaluating other LLMs on more open-ended questions and introduces two benchmarks: MT-bench and Chatbot Arena. The third paper proposes fine-tuning LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks.\\n\\nThe first paper, \"Wider and Deeper LLM Networks are Fairer LLM Evaluators,\" discusses the challenges of evaluating the quality of responses generated by LLMs and proposes a method using an LLM itself to make evaluations through multiple independent evaluations. The authors explore whether deeper and wider networks can lead to fairer evaluations, inspired by the observation that different neurons in a neural network are responsible for detecting different concepts. They construct the largest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark, LLMEval$^2$, and demonstrate that a wider network with two layers performs the best.\\n\\nThe second paper, \"Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena,\" addresses the challenges of evaluating LLM-based chat assistants using existing benchmarks and proposes using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. The authors examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. They verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences using MT-bench and Chatbot Arena and demonstrate that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well.\\n\\nThe third paper, \"JudgeLM: Fine-tuned Large Language Models are Scalable Judges,\" proposes fine-tuning LLMs as scalable judges to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. The authors propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset for fine-tuning high-performance judges and introduce techniques such as swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop to address key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge. They demonstrate that JudgeLM obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both existing and new benchmarks and is efficient, with JudgeLM-7B only needing 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs.\\n\\nAll resources for these papers are available at https://github.com/e0397123/comp-analysis.'"

The studies explore various approaches to improve the evaluation process, including wider and deeper networks for fairer evaluators, using LLMs as judges, and fine-tuning LLMs as scalable judges.\\n\\n1. Wider and Deeper LLM Networks are Fairer LLM Evaluators:\\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to use the LLM itself to make evaluations and improve fairness by designing a network that resembles academic paper reviewing. The network consists of multiple layers, with each layer receiving representations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating locally learned evaluation information for more comprehensive results. Experimental results demonstrate that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2 layers performs best, improving kappa correlation coefficient significantly.\\n\\n2. Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena:\\nThis study explores the usage of strong LLMs as judges to evaluate other models on more open-ended questions. The paper discusses position, verbosity, self-enhancement biases, and limited reasoning ability of LLM judges and proposes solutions to mitigate some of these issues. Results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement.\\n\\n3. JudgeLM: Fine-tuned Large Language Models are Scalable Judges:\\nThis research proposes fine-tuning LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. The study trains JudgeLM at different scales, analyzes its capabilities and biases, and introduces techniques to address these issues. Results show that JudgeLM obtains state-of-the-art judge performance on existing and new benchmarks, is efficient, and demonstrates extended capabilities as a judge for single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, and multi-turn chat.'"

       "\" Title: Recent Advances in Large Language Model Evaluation: TIGERScore, EvalLM, Branch-Solve-Merge, and FLASK\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a surge of interest in evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language generation (NLG) tasks. In this summary, we will discuss four recent studies that have made significant strides in developing new methods for evaluating LLMs: TIGERScore, EvalLM, Branch-Solve-Merge, and FLASK.\\n\\n1. TIGERScore: A Universal Explainable Metric for NLG Tasks\\nTIGERScore is a reference-free metric that evaluates the rationality of explanations generated by LLMs. The study demonstrates that TIGERScore's correlation with human ratings is high and approaches that of GPT-4 evaluators. Human evaluation of the generated explanations showed an accuracy of 70.8%. The researchers believe that TIGERScore shows the potential for building universal explainable metrics to evaluate any NLG task.\\n\\n2. EvalLM: Interactive System for Iteratively Refining Prompts by Evaluating Multiple Outputs on User-Defined Criteria\\nEvalLM is an interactive system designed to help developers refine prompts for LLMs by evaluating multiple outputs based on user-defined criteria. The study shows that EvalLM helps participants compose more diverse criteria, examine twice as many outputs, and reach satisfactory prompts with 59% fewer revisions compared to manual evaluation.\\n\\n3. Branch-Solve-Merge: Improving Large Language Model Evaluation and Generation\\nBranch-Solve-Merge (BSM) is a program that uses branch, solve, and merge modules to tackle challenging NLG tasks by planning a decomposition of the task into multiple parallel sub-tasks, independently solving them, and fusing the solutions. The study shows that BSM enhances human-LLM agreement, reduces length and pairwise position biases, and allows LLMs to match or outperform GPT-4 on most domains.\\n\\n4. FLASK: Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets\\nFLASK is a fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based evaluation that decomposes coarse-level scoring to skill set-level scoring for each instruction. The study shows that the fine-graininess of evaluation is crucial for attaining a holistic view of model performance and increasing the reliability of the evaluation. Using FLASK, multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs were compared, resulting in high correlation between model-based and human-based evaluations.\\n\\nThese studies represent significant advancements in the field of LLM-based NLG evaluation and demonstrate the potential for developing more effective methods for evaluating and refining LLMs for various applications.

In this survey, we aim to discuss the current trends, methodologies, key findings, and future directions in LLM-based NLG evaluation.\\n\\nThe significance of evaluating LLM-based NLG systems lies in their potential impact on various industries and society as a whole. For instance, in customer service, these systems can help businesses provide personalized responses to customers' queries, enhancing the overall user experience. In content generation, they can be used to create engaging and informative articles or blog posts, while in education, they can assist teachers in generating customized learning materials for students.\\n\\nThe objective of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM-based NLG evaluation, including popular applications, methodologies, key findings, and future directions.
