This article provides an overview of how Web 3.0 will affect our daily and future lives. There may be some technologies or ideas that we haven’t discussed in this article, even if we have tried our best to review related literature. We hope that this survey will help to identify potential research directions while investigating and study- ing Web 3.0. Massive studies and cases have shown that combining with Web 3.0 is a viable way to achieve relative equality in the virtual world. Novel technologies break down many barriers (such as data ownership, cost, and limited experience) that are difficult to solve in real life. Web 3.0 provides excellent visualization that is not available in Web 2.0. More research works (e.g., decentralized storage, edge computing, artificial intelligence, and socially linked data protocols) are required for further study due to the rapid de- velopment of technology. Besides, it is worth noting that the paper also draws attention to new ethical and criminal

7.4 Summary and Lessons Learned As mentioned earlier, we have discussed the details of AI and Web 3.0 applications in the fields of finance, metaverse, and healthcare, and the impact of AI on the performance of these applications. Although AI technology has not been fully integrated with these Web 3.0 applications, researchers have also tried to study AI blockchain technology and given some inspiring examples. The inte- gration of AI and blockchain, namely blockchain intelligence and intelligent blockchain, is worth exploring due to their close interaction. With the integration of AI and blockchain, distributed AI can process and execute the analysis or decision of trusted data without any support from a trusted third party. We believe that blockchain encourages AI to reach an unprecedented level in the context of various fields in Web 3.0.

Blockchain technologies, such as Ethereum, have developed into mature platforms in the past few years, and many Web 3.0 applications have emerged. These applications include decentralized exchanges, digital identity verification systems, digital asset management platforms, etc. At this stage, Web 3.0 applications are being promoted to many users, and some larger companies and organizations are exploring the potential of these technologies.

However, Web 3.0-related technologies are still in the stage of innovation foam, and the current expectations for the market value are too high. False and exaggerated propaganda and hype concepts also appeared at the same time. The current market situation is relatively complex. Therefore, we need to view Web 3.0 technology more rationally, recognizing its limitations and shortcomings while facing enormous development opportunities.
