 Recent developments in LLM (Large Language Model) generated text evaluation include using LLMs to evaluate the quality of their own text outputs as an alternative to human evaluations. This approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of LLM performance and predict how a tuned version might behave in various scenarios. Additionally, applying LLMs as evaluators for text generation has been shown to be scalable, cost-effective, and can significantly enhance the ability to assess the quality of generated text. For instance, Fu et al. (2023) use LLM's predicted text probability as the automated score. Furthermore, this approach has been applied to evaluate Chinese LLMs, resulting in a faster evaluation process and decreased average annotation cost per sample. However, it is important to note that the utilization of LLMs as evaluators for text generation is still in the exploratory phase, and there are limitations that provide opportunities for future work, such as the performance of LLMs as reliable evaluators and potential biases in their predictions.
