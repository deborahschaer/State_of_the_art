Response:  Title: Recent Developments in Diffusion Models for Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Survey

Introduction

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to the increasing demand for efficient, safe, and sustainable transportation solutions. ITS encompasses various applications such as real-time traffic prediction, route planning, and incident management. One of the promising approaches to model and analyze complex transportation systems is through the use of Diffusion Models. In this survey, we aim to provide an overview of recent developments in the application of diffusion models for intelligent transportation systems.

Background: Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are a class of probabilistic graphical models that describe the evolution of a system over time as a Markov process. They have gained popularity due to their ability to model complex dependencies and non-linear relationships between variables. In the context of transportation systems, diffusion models can be used to learn the underlying dynamics of traffic flow, predict future traffic conditions, and optimize transportation networks.

Recent Developments in Diffusion Models for ITS

1. Generative Traffic Modeling

One of the recent applications of diffusion models in ITS is generative traffic modeling. In this context, diffusion models are used to learn the process of transforming noise into realistic and physically feasible future trajectories for road users. For instance, T. Westny et al. (2023) proposed a model that generates realistic and physically feasible future trajectories for road users based on their current positions and velocities. The goal is to enable the model to predict how future events such as road construction or unexpected accidents will affect the urban transportation system.

2. Text-to-Traffic Generation

Another application of diffusion models in ITS is text-to-traffic generation. In this context, given a piece of text describing the transportation system (including time and events), a diffusion-based model such as ChatTraffic (as presented in Fig. 2) generates the traffic situation (speed, congestion level, and passing time). This capability enables ChatTraffic to provide predictions of how future events will affect the urban transportation system, pushing this domain a considerable step forward (Jia et al., 2017; Günther et al., 2017; Saroj et al., 2018; Wang and Zeng, 2018).

3. Real-time Data-driven Simulation

Diffusion models have also been applied to real-time data-driven transportation simulation. For instance, Arentze and Timmermans (2004) proposed a learning-based transportation oriented simulation system that uses diffusion models to learn the underlying dynamics of traffic flow from historical data. This approach enables the simulation system to adapt to real-world conditions and provide accurate predictions of traffic conditions in real-time.

4. Congestion Trends Prediction

Another application of diffusion models in ITS is congestion trends prediction. Jia et al. (2017) proposed a data-driven approach for congestion trends prediction using diffusion models. The model learns the underlying dynamics of traffic flow and predicts future congestion levels based on historical data and real-time traffic information.

5. Dynamic Driving Cycle Development

Günther et al. (2017) proposed a big data driven dynamic driving cycle development for buses in urban public transportation using diffusion models. The model learns the underlying dynamics of bus traffic flow and generates realistic driving cycles that take into account real-time traffic conditions and road network information.

6. Metaverse Application in Data-driven ITS

Njoku et al. (2023) discussed the prospects and challenges of metaverse application in data-driven intelligent transportation systems using diffusion models. The authors proposed a framework for modeling and simulating complex transportation systems in a virtual environment, enabling real-time analysis and optimization of transportation networks.

Conclusion

In conclusion, diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for modeling and analyzing complex transportation systems. Recent developments in this area include generative traffic modeling, text-to-traffic generation, real-time data-driven simulation, congestion trends prediction, and dynamic driving cycle development. These applications enable accurate predictions of traffic conditions, adaptive transportation network optimization, and real-time analysis and visualization of complex transportation systems. As the field of ITS continues to evolve, we expect diffusion models to play an increasingly important role in enabling efficient, safe, and sustainable transportation solutions.

Given a piece of text describing the transportation system (including time and events), we present the diffusion-based ChatTraffic to generate the traffic situation. For the first time, our proposed ChatTraffic is capable of generating traffic situations (speed, congestion level, and passing time) according to the text. This enables ChatTraffic to provide predictions of how future events (road construction, unexpected accidents, unusual weather) will affect the urban transportation system, pushing this domain a considerable step forward.
