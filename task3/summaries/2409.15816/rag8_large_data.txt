Response:  Title: Recent Developments in Diffusion Models for Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Survey

Introduction

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to the increasing demand for efficient, safe, and sustainable transportation solutions. ITS encompasses various applications such as traffic prediction, route planning, and real-time traffic management. One of the promising approaches to model complex transportation systems is through the use of Diffusion Models. In this survey, we discuss recent developments in the application of diffusion models for intelligent transportation systems.

Background: Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are a class of probabilistic graphical models that describe the evolution of a system over time by modeling the interactions between nodes and their influence on each other. These models have gained popularity due to their ability to capture complex dependencies and generate realistic trajectories. In the context of transportation systems, diffusion models can be used to model various aspects such as traffic flow, vehicle movements, and user behavior.

Recent Developments in Diffusion Models for ITS

1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
Jonathan Ho et al. (2020) introduced denoising diffusion probabilistic models that can learn complex distributions over sequences of data, such as trajectories in transportation systems. These models use a denoising process to remove noise from the data and learn underlying patterns.

2. Classifier-free Diffusion Guidance
Ho and Salimans (2022) proposed classifier-free diffusion guidance, which uses diffusion processes to generate trajectories conditioned on a set of reference trajectories. This approach does not require explicit classification models and can be more robust to outliers and noisy data.

3. Simulation of Price, Customer Behavior, and System Impact for Cost-covering Automated Taxi Systems
Hörl et al. (2021) presented a simulation framework for cost-covering automated taxi systems using diffusion models. The framework models the interactions between price, customer behavior, and system impact to optimize the performance of the taxi system.

4. Score-based Generative Modeling of Graphs via System of Stochastic Differential Equations
Jo et al. (2022) introduced a score-based generative modeling approach for graphs using diffusion processes. This method models the graph as a system of stochastic differential equations and can be used to generate new graphs that are similar to a given reference graph.

5. Diffusion-based Time Series Imputation and Forecasting with Structured State Space Models
Alcaraz and Strodthoff (2023) proposed diffusion-based time series imputation and forecasting using structured state space models. This approach uses diffusion processes to model the missing data in a time series and can be used for both imputation and forecasting.

Applications of Diffusion Models in ITS

1. Traffic Prediction
Diffusion models have been applied to traffic prediction tasks, where they model the interactions between vehicles and road conditions to generate realistic traffic predictions. For example, Boukerche et al. (2020) used artificial intelligence-based vehicular traffic flow prediction methods that incorporate diffusion processes to improve traffic prediction accuracy.

2. Route Planning
Diffusion models can also be used for route planning tasks, where they model the interactions between users and transportation infrastructure to generate optimal routes. For instance, Ho et al. (2020) used denoising diffusion probabilistic models to learn complex distributions over sequences of data, such as trajectories in transportation systems, which can be used for route planning applications.

3. Real-time Traffic Management
Diffusion models have been applied to real-time traffic management tasks, where they model the interactions between vehicles and road conditions to optimize traffic flow. For example, Chen et al. (2001) mined loop detector data to develop a freeway performance measurement system that uses diffusion processes to model traffic flow and identify bottlenecks in real-time.

Conclusion

In conclusion, recent developments in diffusion models for intelligent transportation systems have shown promising results in various applications such as traffic prediction, route planning, and real-time traffic management. These models can capture complex dependencies and generate realistic trajectories, making them a valuable tool for modeling transportation systems. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as handling large datasets and dealing with noisy data. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring new applications of diffusion models in intelligent transportation systems.

The goal of diffusion models is to learn the process of transforming noise into samples that are representative of the true data distribution. In this work, the task of the proposed model is to generate realistic and physically feasible future trajectories for road users.

Fig. 2. Text-to-traffic generation via diffusion model. Given a piece of text describing the transportation system (including time and events), we present the diffusion-based ChatTraffic to generate the traffic situation. For the first time, our proposed ChatTraffic is capable of generating traffic situations (speed, congestion level, and passing time) according to the text. This enables ChatTraffic to provide predictions of how future events (road construction, unexpected accidents, unusual weather) will affect the urban transportation system, pushing this domain a considerable step forward.
