 Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation have seen significant progress and innovation, with various approaches being proposed to address the challenges posed by evaluating NLG systems. In this response, we will discuss some of the recent advancements in LLM-based NLG evaluation, their current status, and the challenges that still need to be addressed.

Firstly, let us consider PORTIA (Position-aware Objective Reasoning for Textual Interaction Analysis), which has been shown to enhance the consistency rates of various LLMs and comparison forms. In a study conducted on six diverse LLMs and 11,520 answer pairs, PORTIA achieved an average relative improvement of 47.46% in terms of consistency rates (We et al., 2023). Remarkably, PORTIA also enables less advanced GPT models to achieve 88% agreement with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model at just 10% of the cost. Furthermore, it rectifies around 80% of the position bias instances within the GPT-4 model, elevating its consistency rate up to 98%. Human evaluations indicate that the PORTIA-enhanced GPT-3.5 model can even surpass the standalone GPT-4 in terms of alignment with human evaluators (We et al., 2023). These findings demonstrate PORTIA's ability to correct position bias, improve LLM consistency, and boost performance while maintaining cost-efficiency.

Another recent development is TIGERScore (Towards Building Explainable Metric for All Text Generation Tasks), a trained metric that follows instruction guidance to perform explainable, reference-free evaluation over a wide spectrum of text generation tasks (Liu et al., 2023). Different from other automatic evaluation methods that only provide arcane scores, TIGERScore is guided by natural language instruction to provide error analysis to pinpoint the mistakes in the generated text. Based on LLaMA-2 and trained on a meticulously curated instruction-tuning dataset MetricInstruct, which covers six text generation tasks and 23 text generation datasets, TIGERScore can achieve open-source state-of-the-art correlation with human ratings across these datasets and almost approaches GPT-4 evaluator (Liu et al., 2023). As a reference-free metric, its correlation can even surpass the best existing reference-based metrics.

Another approach to LLM-based NLG evaluation is BatchEval, which conducts batch-wise evaluation iteratively to alleviate the issues of sensitivity to prompt design, poor resistance to noise, and inferior ensemble performance with static reference (Chen et al., 2023). Comprehensive experiments across three LLMs on four text evaluation tasks demonstrate that BatchEval achieves a higher system-level Kendall-Tau correlation with humans than baseline methods.

However, despite these advancements, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in LLM-based NLG evaluation. One of the main challenges is evaluating the quality of generated text at scale, as LLMs can generate vast amounts of text, making manual evaluation impractical (Birhane et al., 2021). Another challenge is ensuring fairness and diversity in the evaluation data, as biased or unrepresentative data can lead to inaccurate evaluations (Chang et al., 2021). Additionally, there is a need for more standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks to enable consistent comparison of NLG systems across different domains and tasks (Grigoras et al., 2021).

In conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have seen significant progress with the introduction of approaches such as PORTIA, TIGERScore, and BatchEval. These approaches address various challenges posed by evaluating NLG systems, including improving consistency rates, providing explainable evaluation, and conducting batch-wise evaluation. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed, such as evaluating the quality of generated text at scale, ensuring fairness and diversity in the evaluation data, and developing more standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks. By continuing to innovate and address these challenges, we can improve our ability to evaluate NLG systems effectively and accurately.
