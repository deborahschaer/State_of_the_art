 Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) based Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation have shown promising results, but also present challenges that require further investigation. In this response, I will summarize the current state of LLM-based NLG evaluation and discuss some of the key challenges and potential solutions.

First, let's review some recent studies on LLM-based NLG assessment. One line of research has explored comparative assessment, where two options are compared instead of scoring each one independently. This approach has been shown to be more intuitive for humans and can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods for moderate-sized open-source LLMs like FlanT5 and Llama2-chat (1).

Another line of research has focused on factuality evaluation capabilities of LLMs. A study compared the factual consistency of summaries generated by text-generation models against human annotations using a singular LLM for the entire question-answering process (2). The results showed that while some LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, exhibited notable correlations with human evaluations in certain factuality subcategories, others like GPT-4 and PaLM-2 did not show significant correlations across various factual error categories (2). This suggests a fundamental limitation in the current LLMs' capability to accurately gauge factuality.

A third area of research has investigated instruction finetuning for summarization models using LLMs as references or gold-standard oracles (3). Experiments on CNN/DailyMail and XSum datasets demonstrated that smaller summarization models can achieve similar performance as LLMs under LLM-based evaluation, but they cannot yet reach LLM-level performance under human evaluation despite promising improvements brought by the proposed training methods (3).

Now let's discuss some challenges and potential solutions in LLM-based NLG evaluation:

1. Positional biases: LLMs often exhibit strong positional biases when making pairwise comparisons, which can negatively impact their performance in comparative assessment tasks (1). Debiasing methods have been proposed to address this issue, such as using multiple LLMs or adjusting the prompt design (1).
2. Human-LLM discrepancies: The results from factuality evaluation studies highlight a significant discrepancy between human and LLM-based evaluations (2), which can make it challenging to trust LLMs as reliable judges for NLG tasks. One potential solution is to develop more sophisticated automatic evaluation metrics, such as PMAN (Prompting-based Metric on ANswerability) (4), that align better with human evaluations and provide a more comprehensive assessment of generated text.
3. Scalability: As LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to evaluate their performance efficiently and effectively. One potential solution is to develop more efficient evaluation methods, such as active learning or transfer learning, that can help reduce the computational cost of evaluating large models (5).
4. Ethical considerations: As LLMs become more sophisticated and capable of generating human-like text, it becomes increasingly important to consider ethical implications, such as potential biases in generated text or privacy concerns related to sensitive data used for training these models (6). One potential solution is to develop guidelines and best practices for ethical NLG evaluation, similar to those already established for other areas of AI research.

In conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have shown promising results but also present challenges that require further investigation. By addressing issues such as positional biases, human-LLM discrepancies, scalability, and ethical considerations, we can continue to improve the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs for NLG tasks and ensure they are aligned with human evaluations and ethical standards.
