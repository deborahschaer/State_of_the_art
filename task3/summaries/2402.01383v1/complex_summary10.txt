 Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation have seen significant advancements, but also new challenges. In the context of the Eval4NLP 2023 shared task, researchers proposed a competition setting to explore prompting and score extraction for machine translation (MT) and summarization tasks, with a focus on allowed LLMs and disallowing fine-tuning (Florian et al., 2023). This approach aimed to ensure a focus on prompting and evaluate systems on par with or even surpassing recent reference-free metrics developed using larger models.

One of the significant challenges in evaluating LLMs is the need for fine-grained evaluation, as instruction-following necessitates alignment with human values and the required set of skills varies depending on the instruction (Bajic et al., 2023). To address this challenge, researchers introduced FLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets), a fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based evaluation. FLASK decomposes coarse-level scoring to a skill set-level scoring for each instruction, providing a more holistic view of model performance and increasing the reliability of the evaluation (Bajic et al., 2023).

Another challenge is the uncertainty regarding the capabilities of humans and LLMs as evaluators. While human judgment is gaining popularity in ranking the relative performance of LLMs, it remains uncertain how well humans and LLMs can evaluate outputs from different models (Chang et al., 2023). A study investigating the behavior of crowd-sourced and expert annotators, as well as LLMs, when comparing outputs from different models revealed a concerning bias in the evaluation process. Answers with factual errors were rated more favorably than answers that were too short or contained grammatical errors (Chang et al., 2023). To address this issue, researchers proposed independently evaluating machine-generated text across multiple dimensions, rather than merging all the evaluation aspects into a single score. This resulted in the Multi-Elo Rating System (MERS), which significantly enhances the quality of LLM-based evaluations, particularly in terms of factual accuracy (Chang et al., 2023).

Despite these challenges, researchers have made significant strides in improving LLM-based NLG evaluation. For instance, the best-performing systems in the Eval4NLP 2023 shared task achieved results on par with or even surpassing recent reference-free metrics developed using larger models (Florian et al., 2023). Additionally, researchers have introduced approaches like ALLURE (Auditing Large Language Models Understanding and Reasoning Errors), which involves comparing LLM-generated evaluations with annotated data and employing a singular LLM for the entirety of the question-answering-based factuality scoring process (Chang et al., 2023).

However, the results from studies like "Are Large Language Models Reliable Judges? A Study on the Factuality Evaluation Capabilities of LLMs" indicate a fundamental limitation in the current LLMs' capability to accurately gauge factuality. The study examined the efficacy of various LLMs in direct factuality scoring and benchmarked them against traditional measures and human annotations (Chang et al., 2023). Contrary to initial expectations, the results indicated a lack of significant correlations between factuality metrics and human evaluations for GPT-4 and PaLM-2. Notable correlations were only observed with GPT-3.5 across two factuality subcategories (Chang et al., 2023).

In conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have seen significant advancements but also new challenges. Researchers have introduced fine-grained evaluation protocols like FLASK and proposed approaches like ALLURE to address the challenges of evaluating LLMs as reliable assessors of factual consistency in summaries generated by text-generation models. However, studies indicate a fundamental limitation in the current LLMs' capability to accurately gauge factuality. To overcome these challenges, researchers need to continue exploring new evaluation methods and improving the capabilities of LLMs to ensure accurate and reliable evaluations for NLG tasks.
