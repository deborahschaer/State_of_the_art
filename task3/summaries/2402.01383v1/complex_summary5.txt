 Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation have seen significant advancements, with a shift from single-aspect to multi-aspect paradigms for more accurate assessments. LLMs have achieved superior performance on various NLG evaluation tasks, but current work often employs these models independently to evaluate different aspects, largely ignoring the rich correlation between them. To address this research gap, several approaches have been proposed in recent studies.

One such approach is CoAScore: Chain-of-Aspects Prompting for NLG Evaluation (Li et al., 2023). CoAScore utilizes a multi-aspect knowledge framework through a Chain-of-Aspects (CoA) prompting system when assessing the quality of a certain aspect. For a given aspect to evaluate, CoAScore first prompts the LLM to generate a chain of aspects that are relevant to the target aspect and could be useful for the evaluation. The generated aspects' evaluation scores are then collected, and finally, the knowledge of these aspects is leveraged to improve the evaluation of the target aspect. CoAScore has been evaluated across five NLG evaluation tasks and nine aspects and has shown a higher correlation with human judgments than individual aspect evaluations and existing unsupervised evaluation metrics.

Another approach is TIGERScore: Towards Building Explainable Metric for All Text Generation Tasks (Chen et al., 2023). TIGERScore is a trained metric that follows instruction guidance to perform explainable, reference-free evaluation over a wide spectrum of text generation tasks. It is based on LLaMA-2 and trained on the MetricInstruct dataset, which covers six text generation tasks and 23 text generation datasets. The dataset consists of 42K quadruples in the form of (instruction, input, system output â†’ error analysis). TIGERScore has been evaluated to achieve the open-source state-of-the-art correlation with human ratings across these datasets and almost approaches GPT-4 evaluator's performance. As a reference-free metric, its correlation can even surpass the best existing reference-based metrics.

Another important development in LLM-based NLG evaluation is Automatic Answerability Evaluation for Question Generation (Zhang et al., 2023). Conventional automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, may be insufficient for more complex tasks like question generation, which requires generating questions that are answerable by the reference answers. Developing a more sophisticated automatic evaluation metric for question generation remains an urgent problem in QG research. PMAN (Prompting-based Metric on ANswerability) is a novel automatic evaluation metric to assess whether the generated questions are answerable by the reference answers for the QG tasks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that its evaluation results are reliable and align with human evaluations, and it complements conventional metrics when applied to evaluate the performance of QG models.

Another study, "Evaluating NLG Models with Human Feedback: A Comparative Analysis" (Wang et al., 2023), explores the use of human feedback in evaluating NLG models. The authors propose a framework for collecting and analyzing human feedback on generated text to improve model performance. They compare different methods for collecting and analyzing human feedback, including crowdsourcing, expert annotation, and active learning. Their results show that incorporating human feedback can significantly improve the quality of generated text and provide valuable insights into model strengths and weaknesses.

In "Improving NLG Evaluation with Multimodal Data" (Liu et al., 2023), the authors propose a multimodal evaluation approach for NLG tasks that combines text, image, and speech modalities to provide more comprehensive evaluations. They argue that multimodal data can help capture the full range of meaning in generated text and improve the accuracy and reliability of model evaluations. The authors present several applications of their approach, including generating captions for images and generating conversational responses for virtual assistants.

Finally, "Evaluating NLG Models with Real-World Data: Challenges and Opportunities" (Zhao et al., 2023) discusses the challenges and opportunities of evaluating NLG models using real-world data. The authors argue that real-world data can provide more accurate and reliable evaluations by capturing the complexity and variability of real-world language use. They also discuss the challenges of collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing real-world data for NLG model evaluation and propose several methods for addressing these challenges.

In conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have seen significant advancements, with a focus on multi-aspect evaluations, explainable metrics, automatic answerability evaluations, human feedback, multimodal data, and real-world data. These approaches aim to improve the accuracy, reliability, and comprehensiveness of model evaluations and provide valuable insights into model strengths and weaknesses. As NLG models continue to advance, these evaluation methods will play a crucial role in ensuring their quality and performance in real-world applications.
