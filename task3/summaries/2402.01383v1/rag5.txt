Response:  Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG), leading to new research directions and challenges in evaluating NLG systems using LLMs. In this response, we will discuss the current status and challenges of LLM-based NLG evaluation.

Firstly, it is essential to understand that LLMs have shown remarkable performance on various NLG evaluation tasks (Liu et al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2019). However, most existing work focuses on employing LLMs independently to evaluate different aspects of NLG, such as fluency, factual accuracy, and coherence. This approach ignores the rich correlation between various aspects, which is a significant research gap (Bawden et al., 2023).

One line of recent work on LLM-based NLG evaluation focuses on preliminary explorations of LLM-based evaluators using prompting methods (Schick et al., 2021; Keskar et al., 2022). These studies aim to leverage the instruction-following and generalization capability of LLMs to generate evaluation datasets, reducing the need for manual evaluations to some extent. However, these approaches often lead to significant differences in evaluation results (Gardner et al., 2021; Zellers et al., 2023).

Another line of work on LLM-based NLG evaluation is the development of NLU-style and NLG-style evaluations. NLU-style evaluation methods assess the ability of an NLG system to understand and process input, while NLG-style evaluations focus on the output generated by the NLG system (Bawden et al., 2023). Both styles have their advantages and limitations, and researchers are exploring ways to combine them to create more comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Despite these advances, there are still significant challenges in LLM-based NLG evaluation. One challenge is the lack of standardized evaluation datasets and metrics (Chang et al., 2023). Another challenge is the need for more sophisticated methods to evaluate the rich correlation between various aspects of NLG, such as fluency, factual accuracy, and coherence (Bawden et al., 2023).

To address these challenges, researchers are proposing new evaluation metrics that leverage LLMs in a more holistic way. For instance, Bawden et al. (2023) propose an NLG evaluation metric called LLM-Based NLG Evaluation. This metric uses an LLM to evaluate the quality of generated text based on various aspects, such as fluency, factual accuracy, and coherence. The proposed method also considers the rich correlation between these aspects, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of NLG systems.

Another approach is to use multiple LLMs with different strengths to evaluate various aspects of NLG (Schick et al., 2021). For example, one LLM could be used to evaluate fluency, while another could be used to evaluate factual accuracy. This approach can provide more accurate and comprehensive evaluations than using a single LLM for all aspects.

In conclusion, recent developments in LLMs have led to significant progress in NLG evaluation but also introduced new challenges. Current work focuses on independent evaluation of different aspects, ignoring the rich correlation between them. To address this research gap, researchers are proposing new evaluation metrics that leverage LLMs in a more holistic way, considering the rich correlation between various aspects of NLG. However, there is still a need for more standardized evaluation datasets and metrics to ensure fair and accurate comparisons between different NLG systems.
