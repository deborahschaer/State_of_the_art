 Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to impressive zero-shot capabilities across various Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, making them promising alternatives for human evaluation in text generation. However, experimental results suggest that further advancements are needed to bridge the gap between LLM-based evaluators and human-level evaluation quality. In response to this challenge, researchers have started exploring multi-agent debate frameworks and comparative assessment approaches for NLG evaluation using LLMs.

One such approach is the multi-agent debate framework, where a group of LLMs synergize with an array of intelligent counterparts to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in handling intricate tasks. In this context, researchers have constructed a multi-agent referee team called ChatEval to autonomously discuss and evaluate the quality of generated responses from different models on open-ended questions and traditional NLG tasks. The analysis shows that ChatEval offers a human-mimicking evaluation process for reliable assessments, transcending mere textual scoring.

Another promising direction is comparative assessment, where LLMs are used to compare pairs of candidates rather than scoring each one independently. While comparative assessment has not been extensively studied in NLG assessment, humans often find it more intuitive to compare two options. This work examines the performance of LLM comparative assessment from multiple perspectives: performance compared to absolute grading, positional biases in the prompt, and efficient ranking in terms of the number of comparisons. The findings demonstrate that LLM comparative assessment is a simple, general, and effective approach for NLG assessment.

However, it's important to note that LLMs often exhibit strong positional biases when making pairwise comparisons, which can impact performance. Researchers propose debiasing methods to address these biases and further improve performance.

In the context of question generation (QG), conventional automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are based on measuring n-gram overlap between generated and reference text. However, these simple metrics may be insufficient for more complex tasks like QG, which requires generating questions that are answerable by the reference answers. Developing a more sophisticated automatic evaluation metric, thus, remains an urgent problem in QG research.

This work proposes PMAN (Prompting-based Metric on ANswerability), a novel automatic evaluation metric to assess whether the generated questions are answerable by the reference answers for the QG tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that its evaluation results are reliable and align with human evaluations. Furthermore, applying this metric to evaluate the performance of QG models shows that it complements conventional metrics.

Another area where LLMs have shown promise is in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. RAG systems consist of a retrieval and an LLM-based generation module, which enables them to act as a natural language layer between users and textual databases, reducing the risk of hallucinations. However, evaluating RAG architectures is challenging due to several dimensions: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way, or the quality of the generation itself. With RAGAs (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment), researchers put forward a suite of metrics that can be used to evaluate these different dimensions without relying on ground truth human annotations.

In conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have shown promising results, with multi-agent debate frameworks, comparative assessment, and sophisticated automatic evaluation metrics being some of the key directions. However, challenges such as positional biases and the need for ground truth human annotations persist. Ongoing research in these areas is expected to lead to significant advancements in LLM-based NLG evaluation, contributing to faster evaluation cycles and more reliable and accurate assessments of text generation systems.

Moreover, it's important to note that while LLMs have shown impressive capabilities in various NLG tasks, they are not perfect and still face challenges such as hallucinations, biases, and lack of common sense reasoning. Therefore, it's crucial to continue researching and developing advanced evaluation frameworks and techniques to ensure the reliability and accuracy of LLM-based text generation systems.

In summary, recent advancements in LLM-based NLG evaluation have shown promising results, with multi-agent debate frameworks, comparative assessment, and sophisticated automatic evaluation metrics being some of the key directions. However, challenges such as positional biases and the need for ground truth human annotations persist. Ongoing research in these areas is expected to lead to significant advancements in LLM-based NLG evaluation, contributing to faster evaluation cycles and more reliable and accurate assessments of text generation systems. It's important to continue researching and developing advanced evaluation frameworks and techniques to ensure the reliability and accuracy of LLM-based text generation systems.
