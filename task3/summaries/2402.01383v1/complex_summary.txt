 Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation have seen significant progress, but also face numerous challenges due to the complexity and nuance of human language and preferences. In this response, we will discuss some of the recent advancements in LLM-based NLG evaluation, as well as the current status and challenges in this field.

Firstly, let us examine some of the recent studies that have explored the application of LLMs for automatic dialogue evaluation. For instance, a comprehensive study was conducted to analyze the multi-dimensional evaluation capability of 30 recently emerged LLMs at both turn and dialogue levels using a comprehensive set of 12 meta-evaluation datasets (Wider and Deeper LLM Networks). The researchers aimed to probe the robustness of these models in handling various adversarial perturbations at both turn and dialogue levels. Additionally, they explored how model-level and dimension-level ensembles impacted the evaluation performance.

Another approach to evaluating LLMs is by using them as judges themselves. This method involves having the LLM make evaluations and stabilizing the results through multiple independent evaluations, similar to a single-layer narrow LLM network (Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena). The idea behind this approach is that different neurons in a neural network are responsible for detecting different concepts. In this method, the researchers adaptively generate as many neuron roles as possible for each evaluation sample, with each perspective corresponding to the role of a specific LLM neuron in the first layer. In subsequent layers, higher layers receive representations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating the locally learned evaluation information to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation result.

The effectiveness of this method was validated by constructing the largest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark, LLMEval$^2$, for LLM evaluators. The experimental results demonstrated that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2 layers (one round of discussion) performed the best, improving kappa correlation coefficient from 0.28 to 0.34. Furthermore, WideDeep was leveraged to aid in the assessment of Chinese LLMs, which accelerated the evaluation time by 4.6 times and resulted in a 60% cost saving.

However, evaluating LLMs based on NLG is not without its challenges. One challenge is that existing benchmarks and metrics cannot measure LLMs comprehensively in open-ended scenarios (JudgeLM: Fine-tuned Large Language Models are Scalable Judges). To address this problem, researchers propose fine-tuning LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. This involves proposing a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLM-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges.

Another challenge is the presence of biases in fine-tuning LLMs as judges (JudgeLM: Fine-tuned Large Language Models are Scalable Judges). To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance.

Despite these challenges, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation show promising results. For instance, JudgeLM obtained state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and the proposed new benchmark. Furthermore, JudgeLM is efficient, with JudgeLM-7B only needing 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs.

In conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have seen significant progress but also face numerous challenges due to the complexity and nuance of human language and preferences. Approaches such as using LLMs as judges themselves, fine-tuning LLMs as scalable judges, and constructing large-scale, high-quality datasets for fine-tuning have shown promising results. However, addressing biases in fine-tuning LLMs as judges remains an ongoing challenge. As research in this field continues to advance, we can expect to see even more sophisticated and effective methods for evaluating LLMs based on NLG.
