 Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation have seen significant advancements, with researchers exploring the potential of LLMs as alternatives to human evaluation due to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed to bridge the gap between the effectiveness of current LLM-based approaches and human-level evaluation quality.

One approach to improving LLM-based NLG evaluation is through multi-agent debate frameworks, such as ChatEval. This multi-agent-based approach enables a group of LLMs to synergize with an array of intelligent counterparts, harnessing their distinct capabilities and expertise to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in handling intricate tasks. The analysis shows that ChatEval transcends mere textual scoring, offering a human-mimicking evaluation process for reliable assessments (Chanchimi et al., 2023).

Another challenge is the reliability of reference-free evaluators based on LLMs. While these evaluators show better human alignment than traditional reference-based evaluators, they face challenges when it comes to closed-ended examples with unique correct semantic responses. To comprehensively evaluate the reliability of evaluators based on LLMs, two adversarial meta-evaluation dialogue generation datasets, KdConv-ADV and DSTC7-ADV, have been constructed (Li et al., 2023). These datasets require evaluators to be able to reasonably evaluate closed-ended examples with the help of external knowledge or even its own knowledge. Empirical results show that the ability of LLMs to identify unreasonable responses is insufficient, highlighting the risks in using reference-free evaluators based on LLMs to evaluate the quality of dialogue responses (Li et al., 2023).

To tackle the challenges of coherence and inability to plan and decompose problems for LLMs, Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM) has been proposed as a Large Language Model program (Schlag et al., 2023). BSM consists of branch, solve, and merge modules that are parameterized with specific prompts to the base LLM. These three modules plan a decomposition of the task into multiple parallel sub-tasks, independently solve them, and fuse the solutions to the sub-tasks. The application of BSM to tasks such as LLM response evaluation and constrained text generation shows improvements in evaluation correctness and consistency for each LLM (Schlag et al., 2023).

Another recent development is EvalLM, an interactive system for iteratively refining prompts by evaluating multiple outputs on user-defined criteria (Bhatia et al., 2023). By describing criteria in natural language, users can employ the system's LLM-based evaluator to get an overview of where prompts excel or fail and improve them based on the evaluator's feedback. A comparative study showed that EvalLM helped participants compose more diverse criteria, examine twice as many outputs, and reach satisfactory prompts with 59% fewer revisions compared to manual evaluation (Bhatia et al., 2023).

Despite these advancements, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in LLM-based NLG evaluation. One challenge is the lack of standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks for NLG tasks. Another challenge is the need for more diverse and representative training data to ensure that LLMs can generate text that is inclusive and unbiased. Additionally, there is a need for more research on how to effectively integrate human feedback into LLM-based evaluation systems to improve their accuracy and reliability.

In conclusion, recent developments in LLM-based NLG evaluation have seen significant advancements, with researchers exploring multi-agent debate frameworks, improving the reliability of reference-free evaluators, proposing new Large Language Model programs such as BSM, and creating interactive systems like EvalLM to help developers iteratively refine prompts. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed, including the lack of standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks, the need for more diverse and representative training data, and effective integration of human feedback into LLM-based evaluation systems. By continuing to address these challenges, we can improve the accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness of LLM-based NLG evaluation and bring us closer to achieving human-level performance in natural language generation.
