Response:  Recent developments in Large Language Models have seen significant advancements and innovations in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) over the past few years. This survey aims to provide an overview of these developments, focusing on both dense transformer models and mixture-of-expert (MoE) models.

Dense Transformer Models: The introduction of large-scale dense transformer models has revolutionized the NLP landscape. Brown et al. (2020), Lieber et al. (2021), Rae et al. (2021), Smith et al. (2022), and Thoppilan et al. (2022) are some of the notable works that have contributed to this area. These models, which include BERT (Brown et al., 2020), RoBERTa (Mccann et al., 2019), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), have shown impressive performance in various NLP tasks.

One of the most significant developments in dense transformer models is their size. The largest models now exceed 500 billion parameters, as demonstrated by Smith et al. (2022). This increase in model size has led to improvements in state-of-the-art performance for various NLP tasks. However, this growth comes with challenges. One of the primary concerns is the overwhelming computational requirements. The cost of training and inference increases significantly as the model size grows (Rae et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022).

Another challenge for dense transformer models is the need for acquiring more high-quality training data. As these models become larger, they require vast amounts of data to effectively learn and generalize. This need for large datasets has led researchers to explore various techniques for data augmentation and pretraining on diverse datasets (Wolf et al., 2019; Schick et al., 2021).

Mixture-of-Expert Models: In addition to dense transformer models, MoE models have also gained popularity in the NLP community. Du et al. (2021), Fedus et al. (2021), and Zoph et al. (2022) are some of the works that have contributed to this area. MoE models differ from dense transformer models in their architecture, which involves a collection of "experts" that each specialize in solving specific sub-tasks within a larger problem.

One of the advantages of MoE models is their ability to adapt to different tasks and domains with minimal fine-tuning (Graves et al., 2016). This makes them an attractive alternative to dense transformer models, which require significant computational resources for fine-tuning on specific tasks. However, MoE models also face challenges, such as the need for effective expert selection and the difficulty of scaling up to large model sizes (Graves et al., 2016).

Future Directions: The development of Large Language Models is an active and evolving research area. Some of the current challenges include creating smaller and more efficient models, addressing the computational requirements, and acquiring high-quality training data.

One potential direction for future work is exploring techniques for model compression and distillation to create smaller, more efficient models (Chen et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2019). Another area of research is developing methods for distributed and parallel training to reduce the computational requirements (Shoeybi et al., 2016).

Additionally, there is a growing interest in exploring alternative model architectures that may be more efficient or effective than current transformer-based models. For example, some researchers are investigating the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for NLP tasks (Graves et al., 2013; Pascanu et al., 2014).

Conclusion: In conclusion, recent developments in Large Language Models have seen significant advancements in both dense transformer models and MoE models. These models have shown impressive performance in various NLP tasks but also face challenges related to computational requirements and the need for high-quality training data. Future research directions include exploring techniques for model compression, distributed training, and alternative model architectures.

At the same time this is still a new and extremely active research area where the pace of innovation is increasing rather than slowing down. As in any other evolving area though, there are still numerous challenges ahead. Here we briefly mention some of the challenges and main active areas which are known so far. It is worth noting that LLM challenges are discussed in details in a work by Kaddour et al. [207].

Large language models. A variety of large language models have been introduced in the last few years. These include both dense transformer models (Brown et al., 2020; Lieber et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022) and mixture-of-expert (MoE) models (Du et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2021; Zoph et al., 2022). The largest dense transformers have passed 500 billion parameters (Smith et al., 2022). The drive to train larger and larger models is clear—so far increasing the size of language models has been responsible for improving the state-of-the-art in many language modelling tasks. Nonetheless, large language models face several challenges, including their overwhelming computational requirements (the cost of training and inference increase with model size) (Rae et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022) and the need for acquiring more high-quality training data. In fact, in this work we ﬁnd that larger, high quality datasets will play a key role in any
