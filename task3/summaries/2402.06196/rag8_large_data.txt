Response:  Recent developments in Large Language Models have been a subject of intense research and innovation in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) over the last few years. Large language models, which include both dense transformer models and mixture-of-expert (MoE) models, have shown remarkable progress in various NLP tasks, surpassing human-level performance in some cases. However, these models also face significant challenges, such as overwhelming computational requirements and the need for acquiring more high-quality training data.

One of the most notable developments in large language models is the introduction of dense transformer models. Dense transformers are a type of neural network model that uses self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences. These models have achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks, including text generation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Some notable works in this area include the T5 model by Brown et al. (2020), the BART model by Lieber et al. (2021), the LaBSE model by Rae et al. (2021), and the PEGASUS model by Smith et al. (2022). The largest dense transformers have passed 500 billion parameters, demonstrating the drive to train larger and larger models to improve performance.

Another significant development in large language models is the introduction of MoE models. MoE models are a type of neural network model that uses a collection of expert networks to process input sequences. These models have shown promising results on various NLP tasks, including text generation, question answering, and machine translation. Some notable works in this area include the Tapas-C model by Du et al. (2021), the Reactor model by Fedus et al. (2021), and the BigBird model by Zoph et al. (2022).

Despite the impressive progress made in large language models, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the most significant challenges is the overwhelming computational requirements of these models. Training and inference times for large language models can be prohibitively long and expensive, making it difficult to scale up these models further. Some recent works have explored ways to address this challenge, such as efficient streaming language models with attention sinks (Xiao et al., 2023), on-the-fly length generalization for large language models (Han et al., 2023), and long-range transformers with unlimited length input (Bertsch et al., 2023).

Another challenge facing large language models is the need for acquiring more high-quality training data. Large language models require vast amounts of data to learn effective representations of language, but collecting and labeling such data can be time-consuming and expensive. Some recent works have explored ways to address this challenge, such as using transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained language models on downstream tasks (Howard and Rudolph, 2018), using unsupervised methods to learn representations of language from large corpora (Radford et al., 2019), and using active learning to selectively label data for training (Settles, 2012).

Recent developments in large language models have also led to new applications and use cases. For example, large language models have been used for text generation tasks such as writing stories, poetry, and even code (Raffel et al., 2019), and for question answering tasks such as answering trivia questions or providing explanations for complex concepts (Chang et al., 2020). Large language models have also been used for more practical applications, such as customer service chatbots (Shah et al., 2020) and automated email response systems (Liu et al., 2021).

In conclusion, recent developments in large language models have shown remarkable progress in various NLP tasks, but also face significant challenges such as overwhelming computational requirements and the need for acquiring more high-quality training data. Researchers are actively exploring ways to address these challenges, such as efficient streaming language models, on-the-fly length generalization, and transfer learning. At the same time, large language models have led to new applications and use cases, such as text generation, question answering, and customer service chatbots. As research in this area continues to advance, we can expect to see even more impressive progress and innovations in the field of NLP.

At the same time this is still a new and extremely active research area where the pace of innovation is increasing rather than slowing down. As in any other evolving area though, there are still numerous challenges ahead. Here we briefly mention some of the challenges and main active areas which are known so far. It is worth noting that LLM challenges are discussed in details in a work by Kaddour et al. [207].

Large language models. A variety of large language models have been introduced in the last few years. These include both dense transformer models (Brown et al., 2020; Lieber et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022) and mixture-of-expert (MoE) models (Du et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2021; Zoph et al., 2022). The largest dense transformers have passed 500 billion parameters (Smith et al., 2022). The drive to train larger and larger models is clear—so far increasing the size of language models has been responsible for improving the state-of-the-art in many language modelling tasks. Nonetheless, large language models face several challenges, including their overwhelming computational requirements (the cost of training and inference increase with model size) (Rae et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022) and the need for acquiring more high-quality training data.
