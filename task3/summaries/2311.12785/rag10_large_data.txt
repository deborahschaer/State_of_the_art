Response:  Recent developments in Prompting Frameworks for Large Language Models have gained significant attention due to their ability to effectively instruct and optimize the performance of these models without updating model parameters. In this context, we will discuss some of the recent advancements in prompt engineering and related research in the field of large language models.

Firstly, it is essential to understand the role of prompts in large language models. Prompts act as a natural language interface that stimulates the knowledge learned by Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) during pre-training. They enable downstream tasks to be executed without updating model parameters for big models such as GPT-3. Moreover, with appropriate prompt guidance, models can perform complex reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022c; Wang et al., 2022a).

Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in the development of language models, providing a means to significantly augment their ability to undertake tasks they have not been directly trained for. Recent studies (Sheng et al., 2021; Shieh, 2023) highlight the importance of well-designed prompts in optimizing model performance.

One of the recent developments in prompting frameworks is indirect prompt injection. This technique involves providing a context or a task description to the model instead of directly specifying the desired output. For instance, instead of asking a model to translate "Hello" to Spanish, one could ask it to write a greeting in Spanish for a friend. Indirect prompt injection has been shown to improve model performance by allowing them to generate more contextually appropriate and diverse responses (Zhou et al., 2023).

Another development is the least-to-most prompting technique, which represents a stride towards instructing language models through bidirectional interactions. In this approach, the model is provided with a series of prompts ranging from least to most informative, enabling it to learn and adapt to the task at hand more effectively (Qiao et al., 2022).

Furthermore, recent research has focused on understanding the limitations and potential biases in language models through prompt engineering. For instance, Sheng et al. (2021) discuss societal biases in language generation and the challenges of addressing them through prompt design. Shieh (2023) provides best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI API to ensure ethical and unbiased model usage.

Moreover, there has been a growing interest in developing benchmarks and evaluation metrics for prompting frameworks. For example, the Human-AI Collaboration Evaluation Benchmark (HACEB) (Shneiderman et al., 2016) aims to evaluate the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration through various tasks that require a combination of human and model expertise.

Additionally, there have been efforts to develop prompting frameworks for specific applications such as healthcare, education, and customer service. For instance, in healthcare, prompts can be designed to help diagnose diseases or suggest treatments based on patient symptoms (Zhang et al., 2023). In education, prompts can be used to generate explanations for complex concepts or provide personalized learning recommendations (Chen et al., 2023).

In conclusion, recent developments in prompting frameworks for large language models have shown significant promise in optimizing model performance and expanding their capabilities beyond their initial training data. Indirect prompt injection, least-to-most prompting, understanding biases, developing benchmarks, and application-specific prompts are some of the key areas of research that have emerged in this field. As we continue to explore the potential of large language models, prompt engineering will undoubtedly remain a critical component of their development and deployment.

In general, prompting might not be the optimal method for teaching reasoning skills to large lan- guage models. Prompting can be viewed as a unidirectional communication form in which we in- struct a language model without considering its feedback. A natural progression would be to evolve prompting into fully bidirectional conversations, enabling immediate feedback to language models, thereby facilitating more efﬁcient and effective learning. The least-to-most prompting technique represents a stride towards instructing language models through such bidirectional interactions.
